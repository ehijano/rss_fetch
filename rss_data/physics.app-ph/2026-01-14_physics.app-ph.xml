      <title>{\mu}DopplerTag: CNN-Based Drone Recognition via Cooperative Micro-Doppler Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of drones poses significant challenges for airspace management, security, and surveillance. Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring. The integration of electromagnetic tagging with machine learning enables scalable and efficient drone identification, paving the way for enhanced aerial traffic management and security in increasingly congested airspaces.</description>

      <title>Extended Depth of Field Magneto-Optical Kerr Microscopy for Applications in 3D Nanomagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging of magnetic nanostructures is essential for understanding fundamental spin phenomena and designing advanced devices. Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism have highlighted the growing need for imaging techniques that can capture magnetic structures across curved or tilted surfaces with high sensitivity. Though widely used as a powerful technique for imaging magnetization states, conventional magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy faces inherent limitations in measuring non-planar systems due to its shallow depth of field (DOF). Here, we present an extended depth of field MOKE imaging approach, combining through-focus scanning with image-stitching-based reconstruction, to obtain sharp and well-resolved magnetic domain images across non-planar sample geometries. The method is validated on both perpendicularly and in-plane magnetized films tilted on purpose for this study, enabling quantitative analysis of domain morphology and detection sensitivity. This laboratory-accessible technique provides a fast and versatile route for 3D magnetic imaging, complementing large-scale X-ray-based methods and offering a practical tool for investigating non-planar magnetic samples with tilted or curved 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>Review of ultrasonic methods for monitoring, damage detection, and processing of lithium-ion batteries throughout their life-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the leading technology used in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and grid-level electrochemical energy storage applications. The ever-increasing use of LIBs has highlighted a gap in understanding of their behavior throughout their life-cycle. Current monitoring systems rely on electrical and sometimes temperature measurements to assess the internal state which limits information about complex electrochemical processes. In response, ultrasonic testing (UT) has shown promise for non-invasive assessment due to its ease of use and sensitivity to mechanical changes which are correlated with electrochemical changes within the battery. We summarize the research in UT methods applied to LIBs throughout their life-cycle and the relevant techniques at each stage. We also discuss physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches used to interpret ultrasonic signals in the context of LIBs, with an emphasis on the existing challenge of establishing rigorous links between electrochemical behavior and elastic and poroelastic wave physics to gain insight regarding physical changes in the LIB that can be directly measured using UT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of implementing UT across the LIB life-cycle and identify opportunities for further research. This review aims to provide helpful guidance to researchers and practitioners of UT in the growing field of UT for electrochemical battery systems.</description>

      <title>Slit-Induced Reflection Mode Conversion Between Fundamental Lamb Modes in Elastic Plates with Low-Frequency and Broadband Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact slit-based interface that enables reflection mode conversion in an elastic plate by transforming an incident lowest-order antisymmetric Lamb mode into a reflected lowest-order symmetric Lamb mode. The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels. The proposed design delivers strong low-frequency conversion and sustains broadband half-power operation, while parametric studies confirm that the performance is tunable and robust over a wide range of slit angles and widths.</description>

      <title>Through the bottle authentication of red wine using near-IR fluorescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major unaddressed challenge for food science remains the accurate characterisation of contents in sealed containers with a non-invasive method. This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud. The geometry itself is applicable across multiple fields for the analysis of other high-value products through their packaging, where authenticity verification is critical.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-frequency reflection mode conversion from compressional to shear waves enabled by periodic inclined slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodically patterned free surface with inclined slits can convert an incident compressional wave into a reflected shear wave with nearly complete efficiency at very low frequency. The system is described by two-dimensional in-plane linear elasticity, and the slits are treated as voids. The conversion is quantified by the ratio between the reflected shear-wave energy and the incident compressional-wave energy, obtained from mode decomposition and energy-flux evaluation below the surface. The results indicate that the inclined geometry introduces strong coupling between normal and tangential motions at the boundary, enabling suppression of the ordinary compressional reflection while redirecting the reflected energy into the shear channel. This simple, geometry-controlled mechanism provides a compact route for low-frequency elastic-wave polarization control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chip-to-chip communication, terahertz waves provide a promising approach to achieve high data capacity with improved energy efficiency, effectively bridging the gap between electrical and optical domains. By realizing this potential, all-dielectric waveguides have emerged as high-speed interconnects, offering broad bandwidth and low-loss characteristics while being compatible with planar integration. This paper reviews different types of terahertz all-dielectric waveguides, including photonic-crystal and effective-medium-clad structures, and highlights recent progress in implementing these platforms to develop various passive functional devices, paving the way for high-speed operation and large-scale integration in terahertz systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast quantum optics with attosecond control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Portable Single-Beam Atomic Total-Field Magnetometer for Stand-off Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically pumped atomic magnetometers (OPAMs) offer high sensitivity at room temperature and are increasingly considered for portable magnetic sensing in geomagnetic-field environments. Here we report a handheld-scale, single-beam scalar $^{87}$Rb OPAM with a sensor-head volume of approximately 110 mL. The device operates in an all-optical Bell-Bloom configuration and uses digital lock-in, dispersive tracking of the $^{87}$Rb Larmor resonance, implemented with a hybrid electronics stack that combines in-house control hardware with commercial modules. A single frequency-modulated laser beam performs both pumping and probing without RF coils. In an unshielded indoor environment, the magnetometer exhibits a noise floor below 6 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ near 80 Hz and a measurement bandwidth of 200 Hz. In an unshielded Earth-field deployment, we detect repeatable transient magnetic signatures from a controlled elevator motion sequence and quantify standoff observability over sensor-elevator distances from 1.25 m to 10 m. These results show that compact scalar OPAMs can provide bandwidth and range-resolved event sensitivity suitable for field-deployable magnetic anomaly detection and infrastructure monitoring in realistic geomagnetic environments.</description>

Abstract: As an advanced imaging system, the magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system (MOEJSI) brings spectroscopic techniques with unmatched spatial resolution to very low temperature, high magnetic field and high electric field measurements. It was developed for investigating the magnetic and ferroelectric properties and their mutual control through magneto-optical-electric joint-measurements, besides Raman and photoluminescence features. In particular, the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) loops and imaging, linear dichroism (LD) imaging and polarization-electric field hysteresis loop can be achieved when simultaneously applied high magnetic field (7 T) and electric field (100 V) at low temperature of 10 K.</description>

      <title>EMetaNode: Electromechanical Metamaterial Node for Broadband Vibration Attenuation and Self-powered Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in mechanical metamaterials and piezoelectric energy harvesting provide exciting opportunities to guide and convert the mechanical energy in electromechanical systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control. However, practical realizations remain rare due to the lack of advanced modeling methods and interdisciplinary barriers. By integrating mechanical metamaterials with power electronics-based interface circuits, this paper makes a breakthrough with an electromechanical friction-induced metamaterial node, which realizes self-powered sensing and broadband vibration attenuation in the same time. A reduced-order modeling-based numerical harmonic balance method has been established for general nonlinear metamaterials with local nonlinearities, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The electromechanical friction induced by synchronized switching interface circuits has been revealed for the first time, leading to energy harvesting abilities and the broader nonlinear bandgap and higher harmonics induced vibration attenuation. Experimentally, an electromechanical metamaterial node is realized for self-powered sensing of temperature and acceleration data, highlighting its potential for structural health monitoring and Internet of Things applications. This study provides a practical path to digitalizing structures and systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control by combining advanced interface circuits with mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Observation of narrow-band $\gamma$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first observation of narrow band 1.3 MeV $\gamma$ radiation from a crystalline micro-undulator. A diamond superlattice was grown with a periodical varying boron doping profile. Four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes resulted with a period length of 5.0 $\mu$m and an amplitude of 0.098 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI A accelerator facility. A clear peak was detected with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.28 MeV. Key characteristics of the peak, including photon energy, width and intensity, were reproduced fairly well by Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, optimized boron doping profiles were designed for the 1.6 GeV beam of MAMI C and a hypothetical 3 GeV beam, enabling preparation of highly directional $\gamma$-ray beams with photon energies of 4.2 and 14.5 MeV. The predicted spectral bandwidths are, respectively, about 18\% and 13\%, however, with a high energy continuum tail. The on-target photon flux at a beam current of 100 $\mu$A would be about $10^{12}$/s for the 14.5 MeV photon beam.</description>

      <title>A microfluidic band-pass filter for flexible fiber separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thermal Transport in Phase Change Materials-Based Nanocomposites through Interfacial Structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. On flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced as the contact surface area increases. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase of up to 10 % in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hills" of the solid) and concave ("valleys" of the solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently exhibit lower ITR. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow, leading to interfacial thermal resistance values up to 70% higher than those of valleys, depending on the surface configuration. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy gain upon liquid detachment scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area from 30 mJ*m^(-2) for a flat surface to 40 mJ*m^(-2) for a maximum curvaceous surface, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment.</description>
