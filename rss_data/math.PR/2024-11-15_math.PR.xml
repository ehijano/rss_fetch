      <title>On Time-Changed Linear Birth-Death Process with Immigration at Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an immigration effect in the time-changed linear birth-death process where the immigration occurs only if the population goes extinct. We call this process as the time-fractional linear birth-death process with immigration (TFLBDPwI). Its transient probabilities are obtained using the Adomian decomposition method. In a particular case, we discuss the accuracy of approximation for the obtained transient probabilities. Also, the first two moments of TFLBDPwI are derived. Later, we consider some particular cases of the TFLBDPwI and study their distributional properties in detail.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent averages of a critical long-range stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time-dependent spatial averages of a critical stochastic partial differential equation, namely the stochastic heat equation in dimension $d\geq 3$ with noise white in time and colored in space with covariance kernel $\|\cdot\|^{-2}$. The solution to this SPDE is a singular measure and was constructed by Mueller and Tribe in [MT04]. We show that the time-dependent spatial averages of this SPDE over a ball of radius $R$ at time $t$ have different limits under different space-time scales. In particular, when $t\ll R^2$, the central limit theorem holds; when $t=R^2$, the spatial average is a non-Gaussian random variable; when $t\gg R^2$, the spatial average becomes extinct.</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees. We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve questions related to the mixing of Glauber dynamics in the ferromagnetic Potts model from a uniform monochromatic coloring, and sampling using data-based initializations.</description>

      <title>Iterated Generalized Counting Process and its Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the composition of two independent GCPs which we call the iterated generalized counting process (IGCP). Its distributional properties such as the transition probabilities, probability generating function, state probabilities and its corresponding L\'evy measure are obtained. We study some integrals of the IGCP. Also, we study some of its extensions, for example, the compound IGCP, the multivariate IGCP and the $q$-iterated GCP. It is shown that the IGCP and the compound IGCP are identically distributed to a compound GCP which leads to their martingale characterizations. Later, a time-changed version of the IGCP is considered where the time is changed by an inverse stable subordinator. Using its covariance structure, we establish that the time-changed IGCP exhibits long-range dependence property. Moreover, we show that its increment process exhibits short-range dependence property. Also, it is shown that its one-dimensional distributions are not infinitely divisible. Initially, some of its potential real life applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Hydrodynamic Limit of Hawkes Processes on Adaptive Stochastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the large size limit of a network of interacting Hawkes Processes on an adaptive network. The flipping of the node variables is taken to have an intensity given by the mean-field of the afferent edges and nodes. The flipping of the edge variables is a function of the afferent node variables. The edge variables can be either symmetric or asymmetric. This model is motivated by applications in sociology, neuroscience and epidemiology. In general, the limiting probability law can be expressed as a fixed point of a self-consistent Poisson Process with intensity function that is (i) delayed and (ii) depends on its own probability law. In the particular case that the edge flipping is only determined by the state of the pre-synaptic neuron (as in neuroscience) it is proved that one obtains an autonomous neural-field type equation for the dual evolution of the synaptic potentiation and neural potentiation.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic partial differential equation, $\partial_t u = \tfrac12 \partial^2_x u + b(u) + \sigma(u) \dot{W},$ where $u=u(t\,,x)$ is defined for $(t\,,x)\in(0\,,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot{W}$ denotes space-time white noise. We prove that this SPDE is well posed solely under the assumptions that the initial condition $u(0)$ is bounded and measurable, and $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz continuous functions and have at most linear growth. Our method is based on a truncation argument together with moment bounds and tail estimates of the truncated solution. The results naturally generalize to the case where $b$ and $\sigma$ are time dependent with uniform-in-time growth and oscillation properties. Additionally, our method can be extended to the stochastic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Continuous flows driving Markov processes and multiplicative $L^p$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method of driving a Markov processes through a continuous flow. In particular, at the level of the transition functions we investigate an approach of adding a first order operator to the generator of a Markov process, when the two generators commute. A relevant example is a measure-valued superprocess having a continuous flow as spatial motion and a branching mechanism which does not depend on the spatial variable. We prove that any flow is actually continuous in a convenient topology and we show that a Markovian multiplicative semigroup on an Lp space is generated by a continuous flow, completing the answer to the question whether it is enough to have a measurable structure, like a C0-semigroup of Markovian contractions on an $L^p$-space with no fixed topology, in order to ensure the existence of a right Markov process associated to the given semigroup. We extend from bounded to unbounded functions the weak generator (in the sense of Dynkin) and the corresponding martingale problem</description>

      <title>Anomalous Regularization in Kazantsev-Kraichnan Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a passive vector field which is transported and stretched by a divergence-free Gaussian velocity field, delta-correlated in time and poorly correlated in space (spatially nonsmooth). Although the advection of a scalar field (Kraichnan's passive scalar model) is known to enjoy regularizing properties, the potentially competing stretching term in vector advection may induce singularity formation. We establish that the regularization effect is actually retained in certain regimes. While this is true in any dimension $d\ge 3$, it notably implies a regularization result for linearized 3D Euler equations with stochastic modeling of turbulent velocities, and for the induction equation in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <title>Moment estimates for the stochastic heat equation on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of curvature on the Parabolic Anderson model by posing it over a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. We first construct a family of noises white in time and colored in space parameterized by a regularity parameter $\alpha$, which we use to explore regularity requirements for well-posedness. Then, we show that conditions on the heat kernel imply an exponential in time upper bound for the moments of the solution, and a lower bound for sectional curvature imply a corresponding lower bound. These results hold if the noise is strong enough, where the needed strength of the noise is affected by sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Crossing bridges between percolation models and Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we explore the connections between two areas of probability: percolation theory and population genetic models. Our first goal is to highlight a construction on Galton-Watson trees, which has been described in two different ways: Bernoulli bond percolation and neutral mutations. Next, we introduce a novel connection between the Divide-and-Color percolation model and a particular multi-type Galton-Watson tree. We provide a gentle introduction to these topics while presenting an overview of the results that connect them.</description>

      <title>A Kesten Stigum theorem for Galton-Watson processes with infinitely many types in a random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Galton-Watson process $(Z_n)$ with infinitely many types in a random ergodic environment $\bar{\xi}=(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$. We focus on the supercritical regime of the process, where the quenched average of the size of the population grows exponentially fast to infinity. We work under Doeblin-type assumptions coming from a previous paper, which ensure that the quenched mean semi group of $(Z_n)$ satisfies some ergodicity property and admits a $\bar{\xi}$-measurable family of space-time harmonic functions. We use these properties to derive an associated nonnegative martingale $(W_n)$. Under a $L\log(L)^{1+\varepsilon}$-integrabilty assumption on the offspring distribution, we prove that the almost sure limit $W$ of the martingale $(W_n)$ is not degenerate. Assuming some uniform $L^2$-integrability of the offspring distribution, we prove that conditionally on $\{W&gt;0\}$, at a large time $n$, both the size of the population and the distribution of types correspond to those of the quenched mean of the population $\mathbb{E}[Z_n|\bar{\xi}, Z_0]$.
  We finally introduce an example of a process modelling a population with a discrete age structure. In this context, we provide more tractable criterions which guarantee our various assumptions are met.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benjamini, Yadin, and Yehudayoff (2007) showed that if the maximum degree of a graph $G$ is 'sub-logarithmic,' then the typical range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms is super-constant. Furthermore, they showed that there is a sharp transition on the range of random $\mathbb Z$-homomorphisms on the graph $C_{n,k}$, the tensor product of the $n$-cycle and the complete graph on $k$ vertices with self-loops, around $k=2\log n$. We extend (to some extent) their results to random $M$-Lipschitz functions and random real-valued Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Solution for Asset Allocation with a Multivariate Laplace Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note the theory for multivariate asset allocation with elliptically symmetric distributions of returns, as developed in the author's prior work, is specialized to the case of returns drawn from a multivariate Laplace distribution. This analysis delivers a result closely, but not perfectly, consistent with the conjecture presented in the author's article Thinking Differently About Asset Allocation. The principal differences are due to the introduction of a term in the dimensionality of the problem, which was omitted from the conjectured solution, and a rescaling of the variance due to varying parameterizations of the univariate Laplace distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of training dynamics in the Deep Linear Network (DLN) from the perspective of the geometric theory of dynamical systems. Rigorous results by several authors are unified into a thermodynamic framework for deep learning.
  The analysis begins with a characterization of the invariant manifolds and Riemannian geometry in the DLN. This is followed by exact formulas for a Boltzmann entropy, as well as stochastic gradient descent of free energy using a Riemannian Langevin Equation. Several links between the DLN and other areas of mathematics are discussed, along with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Efficiently learning and sampling multimodal distributions with data-based initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a multimodal distribution with a Markov chain given a small number of samples from the stationary measure. Although mixing can be arbitrarily slow, we show that if the Markov chain has a $k$th order spectral gap, initialization from a set of $\tilde O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the stationary distribution will, with high probability over the samples, efficiently generate a sample whose conditional law is $\varepsilon$-close in TV distance to the stationary measure. In particular, this applies to mixtures of $k$ distributions satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality, with faster convergence when they satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Our bounds are stable to perturbations to the Markov chain, and in particular work for Langevin diffusion over $\mathbb R^d$ with score estimation error, as well as Glauber dynamics combined with approximation error from pseudolikelihood estimation. This justifies the success of data-based initialization for score matching methods despite slow mixing for the data distribution, and improves and generalizes the results of Koehler and Vuong (2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence on $k$ and apply to arbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show for the first time that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be efficiently learned from samples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the number of bipartite graphs with fixed surplus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work on the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph, Do et al. (2023) established upper bounds on the number of connected labeled bipartite graphs with a fixed surplus. We use some recent encodings of bipartite random graphs in order to provide a probabilistic formula for the number of bipartite graphs with fixed surplus. Using this, we obtain asymptotics as the number of vertices in each class tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Structure-informed operator learning for parabolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for learning the solution map of a backward parabolic Cauchy problem. The solution depends continuously but nonlinearly on the final data, source, and force terms, all residing in Banach spaces of functions. We utilize Fr\'echet space neural networks (Benth et al. (2023)) to address this operator learning problem. Our approach provides an alternative to Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), using basis functions to span the relevant function spaces rather than relying on finite-dimensional approximations through censoring. With this method, structural information encoded in the basis coefficients is leveraged in the learning process. This results in a neural network designed to learn the mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Our numerical proof-of-concept demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, highlighting some advantages over DeepONets.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators Can Play Dynamic Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Stackelberg games are a broad class of two-player games in which the leader acts first, and the follower chooses a response strategy to the leader's strategy. Unfortunately, only stylized Stackelberg games are explicitly solvable since the follower's best-response operator (as a function of the control of the leader) is typically analytically intractable. This paper addresses this issue by showing that the \textit{follower's best-response operator} can be approximately implemented by an \textit{attention-based neural operator}, uniformly on compact subsets of adapted open-loop controls for the leader. We further show that the value of the Stackelberg game where the follower uses the approximate best-response operator approximates the value of the original Stackelberg game. Our main result is obtained using our universal approximation theorem for attention-based neural operators between spaces of square-integrable adapted stochastic processes, as well as stability results for a general class of Stackelberg games.</description>

      <title>Intersections of randomly translated sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Xi_n=\{\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n\}$ be a sample of $n$ independent points distributed in a regular closed element $K$ of the extended convex ring in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to a probability measure $\mu$ on $K$, admitting a density function. We consider random sets generated from the intersection of the translations of $K$ by elements of $\Xi_n$, as $X_n=\bigcap_{i=1}^n (K-\xi_i)$. This work aims to show that the scaled closure of the complement of $X_n$ as $n\to\infty$ converges in distribution to the closure of the complement zero cell of a Poisson hyperplane tessellation whose distribution is determined by the curvature measure of $K$ and the behaviour of the density of $\mu$ near the boundary of $K$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous upper and lower bounds of American-style option prices with hedging via neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two novel methods to solve the American-style option pricing problem and its dual form at the same time using neural networks. Without applying nested Monte Carlo, the first method uses a series of neural networks to simultaneously compute both the lower and upper bounds of the option price, and the second one accomplishes the same goal with one global network. The avoidance of extra simulations and the use of neural networks significantly reduce the computational complexity and allow us to price Bermudan options with frequent exercise opportunities in high dimensions, as illustrated by the provided numerical experiments. As a by-product, these methods also derive a hedging strategy for the option, which can also be used as a control variate for variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Learning Properties of Quantum States Without the I.I.D. Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning properties of quantum states beyond the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input states. We prove that, given any learning problem (under reasonable assumptions), an algorithm designed for i.i.d. input states can be adapted to handle input states of any nature, albeit at the expense of a polynomial increase in training data size (aka sample complexity). Importantly, this polynomial increase in sample complexity can be substantially improved to polylogarithmic if the learning algorithm in question only requires non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. Among other applications, this allows us to generalize the classical shadow framework to the non-i.i.d. setting while only incurring a comparatively small loss in sample efficiency. We use rigorous quantum information theory to prove our main results. In particular, we leverage permutation invariance and randomized single-copy measurements to derive a new quantum de Finetti theorem that mainly addresses measurement outcome statistics and, in turn, scales much more favorably in Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Joint identifiability of ancestral sequence, phylogeny and mutation rates under the TKF91 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying jointly the ancestral sequence, the phylogeny and the parameters in models of DNA sequence evolution with insertion and deletion (indel). Under the classical TKF91 model of sequence evolution, we obtained explicit formulas for the root sequence, the pairwise distances of leaf sequences, as well as the scaled rates of indel and substitution in terms of the distribution of the leaf sequences of an arbitrary phylogeny. These explicit formulas not only strengthen existing invertibility results and work for phylogeny that are not necessarily ultrametric, but also lead to new estimators with less assumption compared with the existing literature. Our simulation study demonstrates that these estimators are statistically consistent as the number of independent samples tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between percolation on the Cayley graphs of a group and the dynamical diversity of cellular automata on that group. Specifically, we demonstrate that Gilman's dichotomy between equicontinuity and sensitivity with respect to Bernoulli measures holds on a finitely generated group if and only if the group has a trivial percolation threshold. Consequently, we show that a countable group satisfies Gilman's dichotomy if and only if it is locally virtually cyclic.</description>
