      <title>Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the applied current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is analytically calculated using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. It is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device</description>

      <title>Self-generated time crystal in hybrid Josephson junctions</title>

Abstract: Time crystals represent a non-equilibrium state of matter with broken time-translation symmetry that repeats itself at regular time intervals. Though initially envisioned as a self-generated and self-sustained periodic motion, their realization has usually required the utilization of external periodic inputs or modulations. While at first it looked like, for a time crystal to exist, the initial proposal had to be abandoned, the recent evidence of inherent time crystals is bringing back the idea of self-generated time crystal under the spotlight. In this work, we demonstrate the appearance of a self-generated space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions with the ferromagnet interface without any external influence. The presence of the exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the appearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of superconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation frequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time crystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time crystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is demonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the superconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show that a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent flow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for experimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity coexisting with the anomalous Hall effect in 1T'-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of quasi-two-dimensional materials that display a high technological potential due to their wide range of electronic ground states, e.g., from superconducting to semiconducting, depending on the chemical composition, crystal structure, or electrostatic doping. Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic pressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting, topological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we observe a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the concomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably, upon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant superconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous Hall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in superconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient pressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing symmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system concomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly different band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the superconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable superconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band features can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.</description>

      <title>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Growth and Structure of alpha-Ta films for Quantum Circuit Integration</title>

Abstract: Tantalum films incorporated into superconducting circuits have exhibited low surface losses, resulting in long-lived qubit states. Remaining loss pathways originate in microscopic defects which manifest as two level systems (TLS) at low temperature. These defects limit performance, so careful attention to tantalum film structures is critical for optimal use in quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the growth of tantalum using magnetron sputtering on sapphire, Si, and photoresist substrates. In the case of sapphire, we present procedures for growth of fully-oriented films with alpha-Ta [1 1 1] // Al2O3 [0 0 0 1] and alpha-Ta [1 -1 0] // Al2O3 [1 0 -1 0] orientational relationships, and having residual resistivity ratios (RRR) ~ 60 for 220 nm thick films. On Si, we find a complex grain texturing with Ta [1 1 0] normal to the substrate and RRR ~ 30. We further demonstrate airbridge fabrication using Nb to nucleate alpha-Ta on photoresist surfaces. For the films on sapphire, resonators show TLS-limited quality factors of 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10^6 at 10 mK (for waveguide gap and conductor widths of 3 microns and 6 microns, respectively). Structural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, low temperature transport, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the dependence of residual impurities and screw dislocation density on processing conditions. The results provide practical insights for fabrication of advanced superconducting devices including qubit arrays, and guide future work on crystallographically deterministic qubit fabrication.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>
