      <title>AE-driven Zonal Modes Produce Transport Barriers and Heat Thermal Ions by Cross-Scale Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios where a sustained energetic particle source strongly drives toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAE), and phase-space transport is insufficient to saturate TAE, this novel theory of TAE-zonal mode (ZM)-turbulence -- self-regulated by cross-scale interactions (including collisionless ZF damping) -- merits consideration. Zonal modes are driven by Reynolds and Maxwell stresses, without the onset of modulational instability. TAE evolution in the presence of ZMs conserves energy and closes the system feedback loop. The saturated zonal shears can be sufficient to suppress ambient drift-ITG turbulence, achieving an enhanced core confinement regime. The necessary mechanism is identified. The saturated state is regulated by linear and turbulent zonal flow drag. This regulation leads to bursty TAE spectral oscillations, which overshoot while approaching saturation. Heating by both collisional and collisionless ZM damping deposits alpha particle energy into the thermal plasma, achieving effective alpha channeling. This theory offers a mechanism for EP-induced transport barrier formation, and predicts a novel thermal ion heating mechanism.</description>

      <title>Low mode approximation in the axion magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of interacting large scale magnetic and axionic fields. Based on the new induction equation accounting for the contribution of spatially inhomogeneous axions, we consider the evolution of a magnetized spherical axion structure. Using the thin layer approximation, we derive the system of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations for harmonics of poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, as well as for the axion field. In this system, we account for up to four modes. Considering this small and dense axion clump to be in a solar plasma, we numerically simulate the evolution of magnetic fields. We obtain that the behavior of magnetic fields depends on the initial fields configuration. Moreover, we find an indication on a magnetic field instability in the magnetohydrodynamics with inhomogeneous axions.</description>

      <title>Exactly energy-momentum-conserving stochastic differential equations and algorithms for nonlinear Landau-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb collision is a fundamental diffusion process in plasmas that can be described by the Landau-Fokker-Planck (LFP) equation or the stochastic differential equation (SDE). While energy and momentum are conserved exactly in the LFP equation, they are conserved only on average by the conventional corresponding SDEs, suggesting that the underlying stochastic process may not be well-defined by such SDEs. In this study, we derive new SDEs with exact energy-momentum conservation for the Coulomb collision by factorizing the collective effect of field particles into individual particles and enforcing Newton's third law. These SDEs, when interpreted in the Stratonovich sense, have a particularly simple form that represents pure diffusion between particles without drag. Numerical algorithms that preserve discrete conservation laws are developed and benchmarked in various relaxation processes. Techniques to reduce computational complexity are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNSs) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system dynamics depend on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. A Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)-type instability drives significant dissipation at the magnetospheric interface, generating local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the companions. Outgoing compressive waves occur in a broad range of BNS parameters, possibly developing shocks and sourcing fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>
