      <title>Investigation of Feature Selection and Pooling Methods for Environmental Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dimensionality reduction and pooling methods for Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) using lightweight CNNs. We evaluate Sparse Salient Region Pooling (SSRP) and its variants, SSRP-Basic (SSRP-B) and SSRP-Top-K (SSRP-T), under various hyperparameter settings and compare them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments on the ESC-50 dataset demonstrate that SSRP-T achieves up to 80.69 % accuracy, significantly outperforming both the baseline CNN (66.75 %) and the PCA-reduced model (37.60 %). Our findings confirm that a well-tuned sparse pooling strategy provides a robust, efficient, and high-performing solution for ESC tasks, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios where balancing accuracy and computational cost is crucial.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Multi-group Adjustable Phase Shift Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems face the challenge of high channel acquisition overhead while providing significant spectral efficiency (SE). Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>ASSENT: Learning-Based Association Optimization for Distributed Cell-Free ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.</description>

      <title>Rotatable IRS Aided Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) introduces a new spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting orientations without the need of changing its elements' positions in real time. To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Initialization Gap: A Co-Optimization Framework for Mixed-Size Global Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global placement is a critical step with high computational complexity in VLSI physical design. Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.</description>

      <title>NOMA-Enabled Dual-IRS Relay Network Integrated with Ambient Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a NOMA-enabled dual-Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) relay network integrated with Ambient Backscatter (BS) communication. The system comprises a source, an energy-constrained relay with energy harvesting (EH) and BS capabilities, two NOMA users, and a BS node. The relay adopts a time-switching relaying (TSR) protocol to harvest energy and forward information ,while simultaneously enabling BS-based communication. Two IRS are deployed to enhance the S to R and R to (D1, D2) links under blockage conditions. Closed-form expressions for the Outage Probability (OP) and Throughput of both the main communication links and the BS-assisted secondary links are derived. Furthermore, throughput is analyzed under varying system parameters, including power allocation factors, reflection efficiency, IRS elements, and transmission rate. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results. numerical findings reveal critical trade-offs between the main and RS links. The proposed framework provides useful insights for designing reliable and energy-efficient NOMA-IRS-aided BS networks for future IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication with Hopfield Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional joint source-channel coding employs static learned semantic representations that cannot dynamically adapt to evolving source distributions. Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval
  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Grid-based Uncertainty Propagation for Collaborative Self-Calibration in Indoor Positioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-based localization systems conventionally require stationary reference points (e.g. anchors) with precisely surveyed positions, making deployment time-consuming and costly. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments. The findings contribute to automated UWB network initialization for indoor positioning applications, reducing infrastructure dependency compared to manual anchor calibration procedures.</description>

      <title>Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by &gt; 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.</description>

      <title>Brian Intensify: An Adaptive Machine Learning Framework for Auditory EEG Stimulation and Cognitive Enhancement in FXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.</description>

      <title>NeuroLingua: A Language-Inspired Hierarchical Framework for Multimodal Sleep Stage Classification Using EEG and EOG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Airspace: Synergizing Movable Antenna and Intelligent Surface for Low-Altitude ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Principle: Empirical Evidence for Emergent Phase Synchronization in Human Causal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.</description>

      <title>Uplink Coordinated Pilot Design for 1-bit Massive MIMO in Correlated Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated pilot design method to minimize the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE) in 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Under the assumption that the well-known Bussgang linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE) estimator is used for channel estimation, we first observe that the resulting MSE leads to an intractable optimization problem, as it involves the arcsin function and a complex multiple matrix ratio form. To resolve this, we derive the approximate MSE by assuming the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by which we develop an efficient coordinated pilot design based on a fractional programming technique. The proposed pilot design is distinguishable from the existing work in that it is applicable in general system environments, including correlated channel and multi-cell environments. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the channel estimation accuracy performance compared to the conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Channel Estimation for Bistatic OFDM ISAC Systems: Framework, Algorithm, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we delve into the topic of sensing-assisted communication within ISAC systems. More specifically, a novel sensing-assisted channel estimation scheme is proposed for bistatic orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems. A framework of sensing-assisted channel estimator is first developed, integrating a tailored low-complexity sensing algorithm to facilitate real-time channel estimation and decoding. To address the potential sensing errors caused by low-complexity sensing algorithms, a sensing-assisted linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation algorithm is then developed. This algorithm incorporates tolerance factors designed to account for deviations between estimated and true channel parameters, enabling the construction of robust correlation matrices for LMMSE estimation. Additionally, we establish a systematic mechanism for determining these tolerance factors. A comprehensive analysis of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance and computational complexity is finally conducted, providing valuable insights into the selection of the estimator's parameters. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations. Compared to existing methods, our proposed scheme demonstrates superior performance, particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions or with large bandwidths, while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Complexity Model Selection and Rate Allocation for Multiple-Model Electrical Signal Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.</description>

      <title>Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Multi-waveguide Pinching Antenna-assisted Broadcast Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for multi-dielectric waveguide-assisted broadcast systems, where each waveguide employs multiple pinching antennas (PAs), aiming to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users. To capture realistic propagation effects, we propose a novel generalized frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides PA systems. We jointly optimize waveguide beamforming, PA power ratio allocation, and antenna positions via a block coordinate descent scheme that capitalizes on majorization minimization and penalty methods, circumventing the inherent non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem and obtaining a computationally efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework substantially outperforms both conventional antenna systems and single PA per waveguide configurations, clearly illustrating the intricate trade-offs between waveguide propagation loss, path loss, and resource allocation among multiple PAs.</description>

Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers.

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Interpretation of Radio Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.</description>
