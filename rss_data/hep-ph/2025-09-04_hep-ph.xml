      <title>Axion lines from nuclear de-excitations in galactic stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that mono-energetic axions are produced in abundance through nuclear de-excitations in nearby galaxies such as M87, which is the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, and the starburst galaxy M82. If the axion couples to both nucleons and photons and is ultralight, then monochromatic hard X-ray signatures are induced by the subsequent axion-to-photon conversion in the magnetic fields permeating these systems. We search for evidence of such signals using NuSTAR data, focusing specifically on the $^{57}$Fe de-excitation line at 14.4 keV, and we catalog other potentially relevant nuclear lines. We find no evidence for axions from M87 or M82 and set leading constraints on the combined axion-nucleon and axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{ann} \times g_{a\gamma \gamma}| \lesssim 1.1 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ in the limit $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV, at 95% confidence.</description>

      <title>Testing Seesaw and Leptogenesis via Gravitational Waves: Majorana versus Dirac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the B-L gauge extension of the Standard Model that the Dirac seesaw mechanism with thermal Leptogenesis can be tested using the stochastic gravitational background (SGWB) emanating from a network of cosmic strings when B-L symmetry is broken. With right-handed neutrino mass lighter than the typical scale of grand unification, the B-L symmetry protecting the right-handed neutrinos leads to constraints on the Yukawa couplings for both Dirac and Majorana scenarios. Estimating the predicted gravitational wave background we find that future space-borne missions could probe the range concerning thermal Dirac Leptogenesis. In a comparative analysis between such probes of gravitational wave sourced from cosmic strings in Dirac and Majorana Leptogenesis in the B-L extension, based on the energy scales of the Leptogenesis, for instance, GW detectors will be able to probe the scale of Dirac Leptogenesis upto $ 10^{9}$ GeV, while for Majorana Leptogenesis it would be upto $ 10^{12}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Iterative HOMER with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present iHOMER, an iterative version of the HOMER method to extract Lund fragmentation functions from experimental data. Through iterations, we address the information gap between latent and observable phase spaces and systematically remove bias. To quantify uncertainties on the inferred weights, we use a combination of Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty-aware regression. We find that the combination of iterations and uncertainty quantification produces well-calibrated weights that accurately reproduce the data distribution. A parametric closure test shows that the iteratively learned fragmentation function is compatible with the true fragmentation function.</description>

      <title>Prospects for toponium formation at the LHC in the single-lepton mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of toponium in the single-leptonic final state at the LHC. Our study builds on our recently proposed framework that incorporates the associated non-perturbative effects into Monte Carlo simulations through the Green's function of the non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian and the re-weighting of hard-scattering matrix elements. This allows us to perform a phenomenological analysis that demonstrates that a statistically significant excess from toponium formation could already be accessible in Run~2 data. Moreover, our results highlight observables that provide handles for signal characterisation and establish the single-leptonic channel as a competitive and complementary avenue for the ongoing exploration of toponium signatures at colliders.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Violation and large-$N_c$ spin-flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the contribution of the QCD $\bar \theta$ term to the CP violating pion-nucleon couplings and the nucleon electric dipole moment in a combined large-$N_c$ and chiral perturbation theory framework. In particular, we approach this issue through the emergent spin-flavor symmetry of the baryon sector at large but finite $N_c$. We obtain good agreement with previous analyses for the pion-nucleon couplings and show that the large-$N_c$ framework indicates that tree-level contributions to the electric dipole moment possibly play a dominant role. The spin-flavor symmetry also enables us to provide novel constraints on CP violating pion-$\Delta$ couplings as well as the $\Delta$ electric dipole moment and $\Delta N$ transition moment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the energy loss of energetic jet partons may provide experimental opportunities to constrain the initial nonequilibrium stages in heavy-ion collisions, which requires theoretical predictions for the jet-medium potential. In this letter, we go beyond the usual harmonic approximation, extract this potential for the first time using QCD kinetic theory simulations, and provide a simple cutoff-independent small-distance form. We find significant differences to thermal media at early times in momentum and position space, as well as substantial angular dependence. Applying our results to the gluon splitting rates using a novel computational method reveals tensions in the current kinetic theory implementations for early times.</description>

      <title>The mass-coupling effect in leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle decay in leptogenesis provides a simple avenue to explain the baryon asymmetric universe, where the decaying particle can provide the out-of-equilibrium condition to create a net lepton asymmetry. It is widely anticipated that the lepton asymmetry would be changed significantly by varying couplings and the decaying particle mass, especially in the weak washout regime. Contrary to this naive expectation, we demonstrate a general phenomenon in a class of leptogenesis scenarios from heavy particle decay, where varying the mass and couplings would not modify the lepton asymmetry in a noticeable way, as these mass and coupling effects are largely canceled out from the evolution of the decaying particle. It points out that a much broader parameter space in the mass and couplings will open automatically once leptogenesis is realized in a benchmark point; however, tuning the mass and couplings to boost leptogenesis will be challenging.</description>

      <title>Probing the Chern-Simons Portal at the HL-LHC through Displaced Vertices from W Boson Associated Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the Chern-Simons portal model, an extension of the Standard Model that introduces a massive neutral vector boson $X$ associated with a $U_X(1)$ gauge symmetry. Motivated by gauge anomaly cancellation, the model incorporates heavy chiral fermions that induce observable effects through topological Chern-Simons interactions, despite being inaccessible at Large Hadron Collider energies. We investigate the associated production of the $X$ boson with a $W$ boson and jets at the High-Luminosity LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, considering different $X$ masses benchmarks. A multivariate analysis using Boosted Decision Trees is employed to separate signal from background processes. Detector effects are modeled using a fast simulation tuned to the HL-LHC environment, including realistic pile-up conditions with an average of 200 interactions per bunch crossing. We derive expected $95\%$ confidence level exclusion limits in two-dimensional parameter spaces involving the $X$ boson couplings. Our results demonstrate that the HL-LHC can achieve high sensitivity to gauge-anomaly-induced interactions, setting robust constraints on the $X$ boson coupling to the $W$ boson down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, depending on $m_X$.</description>

      <title>Single spin asymmetry $A _ { U L } ^ { \sin ( 3 \phi _ { h } - \phi_{ R } ) }$ in dihadron production in SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of particle physics, the phenomenon of dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process has always been a significant focus. This paper focuses on the single longitudinal spin asymmetry $A_{UL }^{\sin(3\phi_{h}-\phi_{R})}$ in the dihadron production during this process and combines the transverse-momentum-dependent dihadron fragmentation function (DiFF) $H_1^{\perp}$ to deeply analyze its underlying mechanism. Here, the involved DiFF $H_1^{\perp}$ is the analogue of the Collins function for single-hadron production and it describes the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark at leading twist. Recent studies have shown that the azimuthal asymmetry signal observed by the COMPASS collaboration in the dihadron SIDIS is weak. To reveal the reason for this small signal and to study the asymmetry, we calculate the unknown T-odd DiFF $H_1^{\perp}$ using the spectator model. The spectator model, widely used in SIDIS, describes the internal structure of hadrons and the hadronization mechanism. This model has successfully explained dihadron production in unpolarized and single-polarized processes. During the research process, while maintaining the transverse momentum dependence of the hadron pair, we employ the transverse momentum dependent(TMD) factorization framework, using this method and the model, we first simulate the asymmetry in the COMPASS energy region and compare it with experimental data. Furthermore, we predict the same asymmetry at the HERMES, expecting to provide valuable theoretical references for relevant experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: We revisit higher order corrections to the Starobinsky inflationary model using the most recent P-ACT-LB-BK18 data, which exhibits a mild but definite tension with the predictions of the original model. Our results demonstrate how even small {higher order} deformations of the Ricci scalar (e.g. $R^3, R^4,\cdots$) can bring the model into better agreement with current data and impose nontrivial constraints on the post-inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the CP nature of the Higgs Yukawa couplings is a promising avenue for unraveling new physics effects. In this work, we investigate the possible single- and two-field UV origins of CP-violating leptonic Yukawa couplings, using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory as a stepping stone. We demonstrate a rich set of constraints on the UV model parameters, including direct Higgs measurements, electric and magnetic dipole moments of leptons, charged lepton flavor violating observables, and electroweak precision tests. Studying representative flavor assumptions we find that the precision constraints are often, but not always, more constraining than the dedicated LHC analyses of modified leptonic Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic meson masses from the Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass spectrum of nonrelativistic mesons composed of charm and bottom quarks within the framework of the Curci-Ferrari model in the Landau gauge, focusing on the influence of the gluon mass on our results. We derive the Hamiltonian from the scattering amplitude of a single massive gluon exchange. By incorporating a confining Cornell potential we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the dominant terms of the Hamiltonian, which include the kinetic energy and a Yukawa-type potential. Corrections to the energy are then introduced perturbatively. By studying the parameter space of the model we fit the experimental mass spectrum of charmonium, bottomonium and charm-bottom mesons. From the five parameters of our approach, we allow the gluon mass and the gauge coupling to run with the energy scale according to the ultraviolet one-loop renormalization flows, computed in [1]. Our results show very good agreement with the data, suggesting that a nonvanishing gluon mass provides a better description of the spectrum of heavy mesons than the massless case.</description>

We consider the various vacuum expectation value alignments and consider, for each, softly broken terms that deviate the alignment. We check the evolution of the minima, present analytical and numerical results for the lifting of degeneracies of the physical eigenstates, and describe the decays of the states considering any residual symmetries.</description>

      <title>Prominence: A discriminator of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of prominence is familiar to signal engineers, topographers and mountaineers. We introduce Prominence $\mathcal P$ as a discriminator of gravitational wave (GW) signals. We treat black hole and neutron star binaries as astrophysical background sources, and show how $\mathcal P$ can be used to distinguish between GW spectra produced by first-order phase transitions, domain walls and cosmic strings, and combinations thereof. Prominence can also be used to discriminate between these and off-piste sources of GWs. The uncertainty in the measured energy density in GWs at Pulsar Timing Arrays needs to be smaller than $\sim 4\%$ for $\mathcal{P}$ to achieve discrimination at 3$\sigma$. LISA and ET data are expected to have sufficiently small uncertainties that Prominence can play a central role in their analysis.</description>

      <title>On $\tau$ Spin Use with KKMCee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin of $\tau$ represents an interesting phenomenology data point in both its production from $e^+ e^-$ collision and its subsequent decay. In precision applications such as Belle-II or FCC, where precision tagging is comparable or better than $0.1 \%$ Monte Carlo applications are usually necessary. \texttt{KKMCee}, the precision Monte Carlo program, is assuring such high precision in a broad energy range. But so far, spin effects were not easy to grasp. We introduce into \texttt{KKMCee}, \texttt{HepMC3} format output, new entries, $\tau$ helicity-like information (with weights to evaluate approximation), and $\tau$ polarimetric vectors to enable weight calculations to introduce hard interaction additional couplings. The physics details of the introduced implementations are presented, as well as examples of applications and ambiguities evaluation. The most recent updates and the useful codes of our work is provided at \href{https://th.ifj.edu.pl/kkmc-demos/}{https://th.ifj.edu.pl/kkmc-demos/index.html}.</description>

      <title>Time, quantum entanglement, and particle decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of time ordering in entanglement experiments involving unstable particles, focusing on $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pairs produced in a maximally-entangled spin state. We analyse the correlations between measurements performed by two experimenters, Alice (who measures $\mu^-$ spin) and Bob (who measures $\mu^+$ decay products). Remarkably, the observed correlations persist irrespective of whether Bob's muon decays before or after Alice's spin measurement. We further discuss different interpretations of the same empirical results depending on the observer's reference frame. The findings reinforce the viewpoint that the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement is a mathematical tool rather than a literal account of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Probing dense environments around Sgr A* with S-stars dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate a broad study of some central properties of the string axiverse arising from Calabi-Yau compactifications of the perturbative heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory. Along this road toward a heterotic axiverse, we characterize the generic structure of the axion mass spectrum and the effective couplings of the non-QCD heterotic axions to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and discuss their implications for cosmology, particle phenomenology, and the QCD axion quality problem. We also provide arguments that the heterotic axion masses are bounded from below much more strongly than, for example, the spectrum in type IIB compactifications.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Neutrino-Induced Phase Shift in the 21-cm Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase shift that free-streaming neutrinos imprint on the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, computing for the first time its effect on both density- and velocity-induced acoustic oscillations. Neutrinos are known to generate a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon plasma before recombination, a signature already detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as well as the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) extracted from galaxy surveys. We show that in the 21-cm signal this phase shift is distinct from that observed in the CMB and BAO spectra, exhibiting a characteristic mode and redshift dependence arising from the additional contribution of the so-called velocity acoustic oscillations (VAOs), sourced by the baryon-dark matter relative velocities. Our results establish the phase of acoustic oscillations in the 21-cm spectrum as a promising new avenue for probing free-streaming light relics at cosmic dawn, complementary to existing CMB and BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>Light nuclei under magnetic field and the lithium problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the proton and neutron density distributions of the nuclei 2H, 3H, 3He, which are calculated ab initio, and the 6Li nucleus in the alpha-cluster model. It is found that the asymptotic exponential damp of the probability density at long distance is modified, and that the linear component of the exponent with respect to the magnetic field yields the leading contribution, while those of the second derivative and the confining magnetic force are subleading. Due to the linear dependence of the exponent, fluctuating magnetic fields always enhance the tunneling rate, i.e. the cross section of low energy nuclear reactions which occur at large separation across the Coulomb barrier. While this mechanism cannot suppress the production of 7Be in the early Universe, it has the potential to resolve the lithium problem either by increasing the reaction rate of 7Be + p -&gt; 8B at the bigbang nucleosynthesis era if the magnetic field at this time was sufficiently strong, or by correcting the systematically enlarged 4He + 3He -&gt; 7Be cross section by the unwanted magnetic field generated in the nuclear experimental setup, which was so far used as the input of the simulation of bigbang nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider electric flux tube solutions in SU(3) gauge theory with scalar fields in the fundamental representation. Such solutions can possibly be constructed in two classes, corresponding to the two maximally commuting generators $\lambda_3$ and $\lambda_8$ of SU(3). We successfully construct the 3-type solution with two scalar fields and show that it is immune to decay through Schwinger pair production of gauge bosons but we have not been able to construct an 8-type solution.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fluid behavior in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$ with viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems remains controversial due to the small size and short lifetime of the system. In this letter, we employ viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH), which incorporates large pressure anisotropies, to study the collectivity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$.VAH provides a good description for $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ over a wide range of multiplicities and correctly reproduces the experimentally observed negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. Traditional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH), on the other hand, can describe the measurements, in particular the negative $c_{2}\{4\}$, only with model parameters for which the bulk of the evolution is characterized by large values of the shear Knudsen number. It also can not capture the large longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy during the early evolution. These demonstrate the failure of traditional viscous hydrodynamics in small collision systems and establish viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics as a more reliable framework to describe the bulk evolution and the observed anisotropic flow in p-p collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$\nu$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.</description>

Abstract: The subject of boosted fluxes of dark matter or cosmic relic neutrinos via scattering on cosmic rays has received considerable attention recently. This article investigates the boosted neutrino flux from scattering of cosmic rays and the so-far undetected diffuse supernova neutrino background, taking into account both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays. The calculated flux is many orders of magnitude smaller than either the galactic diffuse neutrino emission, the extragalactic astrophysical flux measured by IceCube, or the cosmogenic neutrino flux expected at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Neutrino absorption in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the absorption mean free paths of electron and muon neutrinos in two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter in the density and temperature range that is relevant to binary neutron star mergers. We model the strong interaction between quarks using a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, performing calculations self-consistently in the mean-field approximation. Since the 2SC gap is large we restrict our analysis to the contribution of unpaired quarks. We find that at low temperatures absorption by a down quark $\nu+d \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ is kinematically not allowed, so absorption by a strange quark $\nu+s \to u+e^-/\mu^-$ dominates the mean free path. As temperature or neutrino energy rises, the $d$ quark absorption channel becomes active, and the mean free path shrinks. We find that in equilibrated 2SC matter with an electron lepton fraction $Y_{L_e}=0.1$, the neutrinos form a degenerate gas with a mean free path of meters or less, independent of the temperature.</description>

Abstract: In July 2025 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collided $^{16}$O$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne$^{20}$Ne isotopes in a quest to understand the physics of ultrarelativistic light ion collisions. One of the key motivations for this run is to discover partonic energy loss in systems with a small quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this letter we combine a BDMPS-Z based model, a path-length based energy loss prescription, and JEWEL together with two realistic geometries of the $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne isotopes. The different sizes of the ions affect the energy loss in characteristically different ways depending on the model.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate elliptical Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills theory at weak and strong coupling for small values of the eccentricity. We obtain analytical results for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the form of a series in the eccentricity parameter. At weak coupling, we use perturbation theory in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills. At strong coupling, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence, which maps the Wilson loop to the minimal-area worldsheet of an open string in AdS space. We present a novel perturbative method to solve the Nambu--Goto equations allowing us to describe the minimal surface in terms of a coordinate parameterization in Euclidean AdS$_3$. Our results for the regularized area agree with those obtained by Dekel in [1] based on the Polyakov action.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the weak mixing angle using direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current ton-scale dark matter direct detection experiments have reached an important milestone with the detection of solar neutrinos. In this paper, we show that these data can be used to determine a critical parameter of the Standard Model in particle physics, across an energy regime that has never been probed before. In particular, we show that the value of the weak mixing angle ($\theta_W$) which relates the mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons can be derived from 1) the recent measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T and XENONnT in the sub-GeV energy range -- a regime which is usually only probed by low energy neutrino experiments -- and from 2) XENONnT electron recoil data through neutrino-electron scattering at energy scale $\simeq 0.1 ~ \rm{ MeV}$, corresponding to a momentum transfer region over an order of magnitude smaller than that explored by atomic parity violation experiments. Now that an indicative measurement of the weak mixing angle exists at these lowest energy frontier, the challenge for the next generation of such experiments will be to provide a more precise measurement in the keV-MeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Primordial lepton asymmetries: neutrino transport, spectral distortions and cosmological constraints</title>

Abstract: The primordial neutrino asymmetry leaves profound imprints on the evolution history of the universe, which can be constrained by cosmological observations, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We present comprehensive analysis on implications and constraints of the primordial neutrino asymmetry, based on a precise treatment of neutrino decoupling by solving the complete (anti)neutrino quantum kinetic equations in the Closed-Time-Path formalism. { Assuming the same primordial asymmetry $\xi_\nu$ for all neutrino flavors,} the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$ and (anti)neutrino spectral distortions are calculated, and we find that the non-instantaneous decoupling correction is given by $\delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.0440 + 0.0102 \, \xi_\nu^2$. Then we perform the state-of-the-art calculation for the abundance of light elements including (anti)neutrino spectral distortions, which indicate a positive asymmetry $0.032 \leq \xi_nu \leq 0.052$ from EMPRESS data. The implications of the neutrino asymmetry for the CMB and LSS are studied in detail, and we find that the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are also significantly affected by $\xi_\nu in addition to the sum of neutrino masses. A combined analysis with EMPRESS BBN, Planck CMB and BOSS BAO data yields a tighter constraint $\xi_\nu = 0.024 \pm 0.012$, which provides constraints on UV models capable of producing large asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation Unlocks Resonant Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinct behavior of decaying particles in true and false vacua of the theory can lead to enhanced generation of baryon asymmetry, a scenario we call \textit{phase separation baryogenesis}. We demonstrate that for leptogenesis this naturally allows for right handed neutrinos to generate resonantly-enhanced lepton asymmetry without fine-tuning of their masses as in typical theories. Our mechanism allows for a variety of neutrino mass hierarchies and hence possible novel connections with observations. We present a concrete realization in a minimal model with a scalar field undergoing a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Exploring multi-step electroweak phase transitions in the 2HDM+$\boldsymbol{a}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple electroweak phase transitions occurring sequentially in the early universe can give rise to intriguing phenomenology, compared to the typical single-step electroweak phase transition. In this work, we investigate this scenario within the framework of the two-Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar, utilizing the complete one-loop finite-temperature effective potential. After considering relevant experimental and theoretical constraints, we identify four distinct types of phase transitions. In the first case, only the configuration of the CP-even Higgs acquires a non-zero value via a first-order or a cross-over electroweak phase transition, leading to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the remaining three cases, the pseudoscalar fields can obtain vacuum expectation values at different phases of the multi-step phase transition process, leading to spontaneous breaking of the CP symmetry. As the temperature decreases, the phase shifts to the vacuum observed today via first-order electroweak phase transition, at this point, the vacuum expectation value of the pseudoscalar field returns to zero, restoring the CP symmetry. Finally, we compare the transition strength and the stochastic gravitational wave background generated in the four situations along with the projected detection limits.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of a doubly charmed tetraquark candidate $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, we perform a systematic calculation of the mass spectra of doubly charmed tetraquark states from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations in a nonrelativistic constituent quark potential model. In terms of the quark-quark potential, the mass of the charmed spin-$1$ diquark is predicted $\sim 3500$ MeV. The masses of the light ``good'' and ``bad'' antidiquark are calculated with $\sim 670$ MeV and $\sim 840$ MeV, respectively. The mass difference between light ``good'' and ``bad'' diquarks is $\sim 170$ MeV, which is consistent with previous phenomenological analyses. The interaction between the charmed diquark and the light antidiquark is then modulated by the quark-antiquark potential in the model, and the mass spectra of doubly charmed tetraquarks from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations are calculated with the calculated masses of diquarks/antidiquarks and refitted parameters from $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $X(3872)$. The $1S-1P$ and $1S-2S$ mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks are about $410-430$ MeV and $610-650$ MeV, respectively, and this mass splittings pattern is similar to that for ordinary $D$ mesons. The mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks with isospin-$0$ is about $10-25$ MeV higher than the corresponding mass splittings of doubly charmed tetraquarks with isospin-$1$ from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations. $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is possible to be assumed as a $IJ^P=01^+$ ground doubly charmed tetraquark candidate with a light ``good'' antidiquark, and the next $P$-wave excited doubly charmed tetraquarks are predicted to have masses with an average $420-430$ MeV higher. A $J^P=0^+$ ground doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3834)$ with isospin-$1$ located around $3834$ MeV is expected.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fifth Force on Lepton Spins through Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a fifth force mediated by a light vector boson that couples to lepton spins, characterized by axial-vector couplings to leptons and vector couplings to nucleons. This interaction generates a potential proportional to the inner product of the lepton spin vector and the nucleon-lepton relative velocity vector, a feature extensively explored with precision spin sensors. Employing weak symmetry, we show that left-handed charged lepton couplings naturally extend to left-handed neutrinos, enabling this fifth force to influence neutrino oscillations. For electron-nucleon couplings, we find that solar and reactor neutrino experiments provide comparable constraints to those from spin sensors and surpass them in the short-range fifth force region. For muon-nucleon couplings, neutrino oscillation experiments exclude the fifth force as a viable explanation for the muon $ g-2 $ anomaly in the context of a vector mediator, tightening the bounds by two orders of magnitude in coupling strength by solar and atmospheric neutrino data. Our results highlight the critical role of neutrino oscillations in probing fifth forces acting across all three generations of lepton spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze possible new physics (NP) effects on $b\to s$ transition processes, $R(K^{(*)})$, $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$, and $B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu}$ decays. Though recent data for $R(K^{(*)})$ and ${\rm Br}(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ are compatible with the standard model (SM), there are still rooms for NP beyond the SM. Especially ${\rm Br}(B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu})$ is measured to exceed the theoretical predictions. We parameterize the NP effects in a generic way with explicit NP scale $M_{\rm NP}$ and some possible powers of it. For reasonable ranges of NP fermionic couplings we find a window of $3.17~{\rm TeV} \le M_{\rm NP}\le 14.9~{\rm TeV}$ for new particles. When including ${\rm Br}(B^+\to K^+\mu^+\mu^-)$ and the angular observable $P_5'(B^+\to K^{*+}\mu^+\mu^-)$ we have a wider range of the window.
  Implications of our analysis about specific NP models are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the development of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in coordinate space (C-LCOPT). Compared to light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in momentum space (LCOPT), the role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCOPT by paths, which are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCOPT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points of the path and the sum of the light-cone distances of all lines along the path computed from their plus and transverse coordinates. We observe that this method, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms.</description>

      <title>Tensor Meson Pole contributions to the HLbL piece of $a_{\mu}^{\rm{HLbL}}$ within R$\chi$T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report our results for the tensor meson pole contributions to the Hadronic Light-by-Light piece of $a_\mu$ in the purely hadronic region, using Resonance Chiral Theory. Given the differences between the dispersive and holographic results for it and the resulting discussion of the corresponding uncertainty estimate for the Hadronic Light-by-Light section of the muon \ensuremath{g - 2} theory initiative second White Paper, we consider timely to present an alternative evaluation. In our approach, in addition to the lightest tensor meson nonet, two vector meson resonance nonets are considered. We work in the chiral limit, where all parameters are determined by imposing short-distance QCD constraints, and the radiative tensor decay widths. Within the minimal setting rendering smooth short-distance behaviour, only the form factor $\mathcal{F}_1^T$ is non-vanishing, in agreement with the result put forward by the dispersive study. In this case, we obtain the following results for the different contributions (in units of $10^{-11}$): $a_\mu^{\rm a_2-pole}=-\left(1.09(10)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.11}_{-0.00})_{\rm syst}\right)$, $a_\mu^{\rm f_2-pole}=-\left(3.4(3)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.0}_{-0.4})_{\rm syst}\right)$ and $a_\mu^{\rm f_2^\prime-pole}=-\left(0.046(14)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.000}_{-0.008})_{\rm syst}\right)$, which add up to $a_\mu^{a_2+f_2+f_2^\prime \rm - pole}=-\left(4.5^{+0.3}_{-0.5}\right)$, in close agreement with the holographic result. However, with an extended Lagrangian, that also generates $\mathcal{F}_3^T$, we have found: $a_\mu^{\rm a_2-pole}=+3.3(1.4)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.00}_{-0.07})_{\rm syst}$, $a_\mu^{\rm f_2-pole}=+6(5)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.12}_{-0.29})_{\rm syst}$ and $ a_\mu^{\rm f_2'-pole}=$ $+0.8(5)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.001}_{-0.000})_{\rm syst}$, summing to $a_\mu^{a_2+f_2+f_2^\prime \rm - pole}=+10(5)$, which agree in sign with the holographic values, exceeding them in magnitude, however.</description>

      <title>Axionless Solution to the Strong CP Problem -- two-zeros textures of the quark and lepton mass matrices and neutrino CP violation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD. This solution requires the vanishing ${\rm arg}\,[{\rm det}\, M_d\, {\rm det} M_u]$, where the $M_d$ and $M_u$ are the mass matrices for the down- and up-type quarks. It happens if we have several zeros in the quark mass matrices. We proceed a systematic construction, in this paper, of two zeros textures for the down-type quark mass matrix while the mass matrix for the up-type quarks is always diagonal. We find only three types of the mass matrices can explain the observed CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and the charged leptons and the small enough vacuum angle $\theta &lt; 10^{-10}$. We extend the mass construction to the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP violating parameter $\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter $m_{\beta\beta}$. It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchies in the neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where we introduce only two right-handed neutrinos $N$s. Furthermore, we have a strict prediction on the $\delta_{CP} \simeq 200^\circ$ or $250^\circ$ in the NH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the recently discovered global $\textit{goofy}$ transformations and conclude that their understanding is mandatory to describe the renormalization group (RG) fixed point structure of quantum field theories (QFTs) in general. Originally, goofy transformations were identified in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), where their surprisingly RG stable parameter relations do not correspond to any $\textit{regular}$ symmetry. We unveil several new goofy transformations and their associated RG fixed points, which we have explicitly checked to be RG invariant to three-loop order in gauge-, and scalar quantum corrections. We give a general argument as to why the implied parameter relations are RG invariant to all orders, even though the corresponding goofy transformations are explicitly broken by the gauge-kinetic terms. Goofy transformations can prohibit bare scalar mass parameters and give rise to generation-dependent sensitivity on relative signs of gauge couplings, for what reason they may have important applications for the electroweak hierarchy problem and the Standard Model flavor puzzle. We also discuss the relevance of goofy-symmetric RG fixed points for a phenomenon of "dynamical classicalization" in QFT.</description>

      <title>Computing singlet scalar freeze-out with plasmon and plasmino states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The final-state particles from cosmological dark matter co-annihilation are expected to equilibrate. As dictated by Hard Thermal Loop resummation, the spectrum of equilibrated quasiparticles is richer than in vacuum, with a massless gauge field possessing three independent polarization states (``plasmons''), and a massless fermion developing a novel branch (``plasmino''). Furthermore, once the Higgs phenomenon sets in, vacuum and thermal mass corrections interfere. We collect together the corresponding poles and residues for the Standard Model around its crossover temperature. Choosing its singlet scalar extension for illustration, we subsequently demonstrate, both numerically and via power counting, and in accordance with general theoretical expectations, how in the freeze-out of TeV-scale dark matter, these effects remain well hidden in the inclusive annihilation cross section. In particular, the dominant (longitudinal) gauge channel is shown to be practically temperature-independent. Cosmological constraints on TeV-scale singlet scalars are reconfirmed.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate how the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) can be used to discover dark bosons with masses in the $\sim$ (10~MeV -- 10~GeV) regime, having a wide range of properties. We only require that the dark bosons have a non-negligible weak coupling to electrons and decay with $\ord{1}$ branching fraction into invisible final states. Our signal selection takes advantage of the excellent electron beam kinematic measurements and the capability to tag incoherent scattering, as envisioned at the EIC. This makes the EIC a powerful tool for uncovering potential dark sector forces, for a variety of possibilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of theories with a $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry associated with leptonic chiral currents. The low-energy effective field theory includes a light spin-$1$ boson coupled to the electroweak gauge sector via a Wess-Zumino term, which ensures anomaly cancellation in the infrared. As a concrete application, we show that a light vector boson with mass $m_X \simeq 2.1\,\text{GeV}$, coupled to a $\tau$-lepton chiral current, can readily account for the recent $3\sigma$ excess observed in $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ at Belle II, while remaining consistent with existing constraints from $Z \to \gamma E_{\rm miss}$ and direct searches for anomalon fields responsible for anomaly cancellation in the ultraviolet. After classifying phenomenologically viable models, we explore in greater detail two concrete realizations which give rise to distinctive phenomenological signatures, potentially accessible at future experiments at the high-energy and intensity frontiers.</description>

      <title>The Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium and Energy Budget with Full Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework based on the full one-loop finite-temperature effective potential model, within which the bubble wall velocity is calculated using the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) approximation, and the kinetic energy fraction $K$ is computed directly. In cosmological phase transitions, these quantities play a critical role in determining the resulting gravitational wave signals. Using the xSM as a benchmark model, we compute the peak gravitational wave spectra under different methods for determining the wall velocity and the kinetic energy fraction $K$, and compare these results to those obtained using the commonly employed bag model. Within the scanned parameter space, we find: (1) Deflagration is the most prevalent mode of fluid motion.(2) Gravitational wave spectra based on the full effective potential with LTE-derived wall velocity and integrated $K$ can differ significantly from those using the bag model with fitted $K$. In the deflagration regime, discrepancies reach up to 48\% in peak frequency and 90\% in amplitude.(3) The bag model provides a good approximation to the full equation of state in many cases. Notably, in deflagration scenarios with input wall velocity, the gravitational wave spectra obtained from the bag model more closely resemble the LTE-based results than those derived using the full potential with this input wall velocity.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ in the diquark-triquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the fully heavy pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ utilizing both diquark and triquark Regge trajectory relations. Using these new relations, we discuss four series of Regge trajectories: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda_1$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other three series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can not be obtained by simply imitating the meson Regge trajectories because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, pentaquark's structure and substructure should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories must rely solely on fitting existing theoretical or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and constituents' masses and string tension will become unobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by the simple fitted formulas. Four series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ all exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$, where $x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2,N_{r_1},N_{r_2},L_1,L_2$. All four series of trajectories exhibit concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane.</description>

      <title>One-loop analysis of dark matter constraints in a complex scalar extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model, which provides a scalar dark matter candidate. We impose the constraints from the observed relic abundance together with the most stringent limits from direct detection experiments on the model. The counterterms are determined so that the vacuum and mass conditions are consistently satisfied at one-loop order, and the one-loop corrections to scalar self-interactions are fully included in the amplitudes involving the dark matter particle. As a result, the allowed parameter region shows clear deviations from the tree-level analysis, demonstrating the impact of quantum corrections on the phenomenology of dark matter.</description>

      <title>$X(3872)$ and hidden charmed tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a constituent quark model, a hidden charmed tetraquark is assumed consisting of a $cq$ diquark and an $\bar c\bar q$ antidiquark or vice versa. The Semay-Silvestre-Brac potentials are employed to calculate the masses of $cq$ (q=u, d) diquarks. The mass of the $cq$ diquark or $\bar c\bar q$ antidiquark with spin-$0$ is predicted with $\sim 2175$ MeV, and the spin-$1$ one is predicted with $\sim 2220$ MeV. The masses of hidden charmed tetraquarks from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations are systemically calculated in terms of the same potentials. It is found that the mass of hidden charmed tetraquark without radial excitation grows higher in $1^{+-},~1^{++},~1^{--},~0^{-+},~0^{--},~1^{-+},~\cdots$ sequence, and the tetraquarks with exotic $J^{PC}=0^{--},~1^{-+}$ have higher masses. The hidden charmed tetraquarks with radial excitations have masses larger than $4300$ MeV. The $1S-1P$ and $1S-2S$ mass splittings of the hidden charmed tetraquarks are about $390-400$ MeV and $550-570$ MeV, respectively, which are about $70$ MeV and $50$ MeV smaller than those of normal charmonium. The $1P-2P$ and $2S-2P$ mass splittings are similar to those for conventional $c\bar c$ charmonium mesons. Based on our predicted masses for hidden charmed tetraquarks, some XYZ exotics are analyzed and tentatively assigned. $X^*(3860)$ is possibly the $0^{++}$ tetraquark. $Z_c(3900)$ and $X(3940)$ are possibly the $1^{+-}$ tetraquarks, and $X(3872)$ is possibly a $1^{++}$ tetraquark. $X(4250)$ may be a $0^{-+}$, $0^{++}$ or $1^{-+}$ tetraquark, $X(4240)$ may be a $0^{--}$ tetraquark. With radial excitations, $X(4350)$ may be a $0^{++}$ tetraquark, $Z_c(4430)$ may be a $1^{+-}$ tetraquark, $X(4630)$ may be a $0^{-+}$ or $1^{-+}$ tetraquark, and $X(Y)(4660)$ may be the $1^{--}$ tetraquark. $Y(4008)$ or $Y(4390)$ seems impossibly the $1^{--}$ tetraquark.</description>

      <title>Signals of merging supermassive primordial black holes in pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we evaluate whether the gravitational wave background recently observed by a number of different pulsar timing arrays could be due to merging primordial supermassive black hole binaries. We find that for homogeneously distributed primordial black holes this possibility is inconsistent with strong cosmological and astrophysical constraints on their total abundance. If the distribution exhibits some clustering, however, the merger rate will, in general, be enhanced, opening the window for a consistent interpretation of the pulsar timing array data in terms of merging primordial black holes, if $\mu$-distortion constraints associated with the formation mechanism can be evaded.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave and particle emission from a cosmic string loop: local case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \simeq 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 6000$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, often lead to breakthroughs in the our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Probing Benchmark Models of Hidden-Sector Dark Matter with DAMIC-M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles interacting with electrons using the DAMIC-M prototype detector at the Modane Underground Laboratory. The data feature a significantly lower detector single $e^-$ rate (factor 50) compared to our previous search, while also accumulating a ten times larger exposure of $\sim$1.3 kg-day. DM interactions in the skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are searched for as patterns of two or three consecutive pixels with a total charge between 2 and 4 $e^-$. We find 144 candidates of 2 $e^-$ and 1 candidate of 4 $e^-$, where 141.5 and 0.071, respectively, are expected from background. With no evidence of a DM signal, we place stringent constraints on DM particles with masses between 1 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$ interacting with electrons through an ultra-light or heavy mediator. For large ranges of DM masses below 1 GeV/c$^2$, we exclude theoretically-motivated benchmark scenarios where hidden-sector particles are produced as a major component of DM in the Universe through the freeze-in or freeze-out mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present WI2easy, a Mathematica package for high-precision analysis of warm inflation (WI) dynamics, enabling efficient computation of both background evolution and curvature perturbations. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the tool supports a broad spectrum of inflaton potentials--including large-field, small-field, and hybrid models--and accommodates arbitrary dissipation coefficients dependent on temperature, field amplitude, or both, encompassing canonical forms prevalent in WI studies. Users can define custom models through intuitive commands, generating full dynamical trajectories and perturbation spectra in a streamlined workflow. This facilitates rapid confrontation of theoretical predictions with observational constraints, empowering systematic exploration of WI parameter spaces. WI2easy bridges the gap between theoretical models and observational cosmology, offering a robust, adaptable framework for next-generation inflationary analyses.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on rigid cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>Dyons in higher-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov (TP) monopole and then dyon in the framework of higher dimensional gauge theories, such as gauge-Higgs unification models. First, we point out that the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole is nothing but a self-dual gauge field in the 4-dimensional (4D) space including the extra dimension, which is argued to lead to a consequence that the mass of the BPS monopole $M_{{\rm TPM}}$ and therefore the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field are topologically quantized. In literatures, there exist related arguments on the calorons, which may be understood to be a composition of a pair of constituent monopole and anti-monopole, with each constituent carrying fractional topological charge, while the net topological charge carried by the caloron is unity. From the viewpoint of the caloron, our conclusion of the quantized monopole mass corresponds to the special case, where only a single monopole exists that carries the net topological charge. Next, the argument is generalized to the case of dyon. The mass of the BPS dyon, $M_{{\rm BPS}}$, is still proportional to the quantized Higgs VEV, though it also depends on a parameter $\mu$, denoting the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges of the dyon. In the 5D gauge theories the Chern-Simons term is induced at the quantum level, which, after the extra space component of the gauge field is replaced by its VEV, produces the $\theta$ term. Then, through the Witten effect we reach to an interesting conclusion that the parameter $\mu$ and therefore $M_{{\rm BPS}}$ are discretized. In addition, we propose a numerical method to obtain the field configurations and the mass of the non-BPS dyons by use of ``modified" gradient flow equations.</description>
