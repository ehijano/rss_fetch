      <title>A duality for the class of compact $T_1$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a contravariant adjunction between compact $T_1$-spaces and a class of distributive lattices which recomprises key portions of Stone's duality and of Isbell's duality among its instantiations. This brings us to focus on $T_1$-spaces, rather than sober spaces, and to identify points in them with minimal prime filters on some base for a $T_1$-topology (which is what Stone's duality does on the base of clopen sets of compact $0$-dimensional spaces), in spite of completely prime filters on the topology (which is what Isbell's duality does on a sober space).
  More precisely our contravariant adjunction produces a contravariant, faithful and full embedding of the category of compact $T_1$-spaces with arrows given by closed continuous map as a reflective subcategory of a category $\mathsf{SbfL} $ whose objects are the bounded distributive lattices isomorphic to some base of a $T_1$-topological space (e.g. subfits, when the lattices are frames) and whose arrows are given by (what we call) set-like-morphisms (a natural class of morphisms characterized by a first order expressible constraint).
  Furthermore this contravariant adjunction becomes a duality when one restricts on the topological side to the category of compact $T_2$-spaces with arbitrary continuous maps, and on the lattice-theoretic side to the category of compact, complete, and normal lattices.
  A nice by-product of the above results is a lattice-theoretic reformulation of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification theorem which we have not been able to trace elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>Covering conditions for ideals in semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove prime avoidance for ringoids. We also generalize McCoy's and Davis' prime avoidance theorems in the context of semiring theory. Next, we proceed to define and characterize compactly packed semirings and show that a commutative semiring is compactly packed if and only if each prime ideal is the radical of a principal ideal. Finally, we calculate the set of zero-divisors of some monoid semimodules over compactly packed semirings in terms of their prime ideals.</description>
