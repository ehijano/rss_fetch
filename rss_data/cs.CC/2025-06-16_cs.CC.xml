      <title>Second-Order Parameterizations for the Complexity Theory of Integrable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified second-order parameterized complexity theory for spaces of integrable functions. This generalizes the well-established case of second-order parameterized complexity theory for spaces of continuous functions. Specifically we prove the mutual linear equivalence of three natural parameterizations of the space $\Lrm{p}$ of $p$-integrable complex functions on the real unit interval: (binary) $\Lrm{p}$-modulus, rate of convergence of Fourier series, and rate of approximation by step functions.</description>

      <title>Complexity of normalized stochastic first-order methods with momentum under heavy-tailed noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Limit-sure reachability for small memory policies in POMDPs is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard model that arises in several applications in sequential decision making is partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) where a decision-making agent interacts with an uncertain environment. A basic objective in such POMDPs is the reachability objective, where given a target set of states, the goal is to eventually arrive at one of them. The limit-sure problem asks whether reachability can be ensured with probability arbitrarily close to 1. In general, the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs is undecidable. However, in many practical cases the most relevant question is the existence of policies with a small amount of memory. In this work, we study the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs with a fixed amount of memory. We establish that the computational complexity of the problem is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Depth-4 PIT and Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of deterministic PIT for $\Sigma^{[k]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits over fields of any characteristic, where $k$ and $\delta$ are bounded. Our main result is a deterministic polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithm for $\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\delta]}$ circuits, under the additional condition that one of the summands at the top $\Sigma$ gate is squarefree.
  Our techniques are purely algebro-geometric: they do not rely on Sylvester--Gallai-type theorems, and our PIT result holds over arbitrary fields.
  The core of our proof is based on the normalization of algebraic varieties. Specifically, we carry out the analysis in the integral closure of a coordinate ring, which enjoys better algebraic properties than the original ring.</description>

      <title>Spanning Trees Minimizing Branching Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Branch Vertices Spanning Tree problem aims to find a spanning tree $T$ in a given graph $G$ with the fewest branch vertices, defined as vertices with a degree three or more in $T$. This problem, known to be NP-hard, has attracted significant attention due to its importance in network design and optimization. Extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of this problem, with recent studies delving into its fixed-parameter tractability.
  In this paper, we focus primarily on the parameter modular-width. We demonstrate that finding a spanning tree with the minimum number of branch vertices is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) when considered with respect to modular-width. Additionally, in cases where each vertex in the input graph has an associated cost for serving as a branch vertex, we prove that the problem of finding a spanning tree with the minimum branch cost (i.e., minimizing the sum of the costs of branch vertices) is FPT with respect to neighborhood diversity.</description>

      <title>The Days On Days Off Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personnel scheduling problems have received considerable academic attention due to their relevance in various real-world applications. These problems involve preparing feasible schedules for an organization's employees and often account for factors such as qualifications of workers and holiday requests, resulting in complex constraints. While certain versions of the personnel rostering problem are widely acknowledged as NP-hard, there is limited theoretical analysis specific to many of its variants. Many studies simply assert the NP-hardness of the general problem without investigating whether the specific cases they address inherit this computational complexity.
  In this paper, we examine a variant of the personnel scheduling problems, which involves scheduling a homogeneous workforce subject to constraints concerning both the total number and the number of consecutive work days and days off. This problem was claimed to be NP-complete by [Brunner+2013]. In this paper, we prove its NP-completeness and investigate how the combination of constraints contributes to this complexity. Furthermore, we analyze various special cases that arise from the omission of certain parameters, classifying them as either NP-complete or polynomial-time solvable. For the latter, we provide easy-to-implement and efficient algorithms to not only determine feasibility, but also compute a corresponding schedule.</description>
