      <title>The basic locus of regular ramified unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces at vertex-stabilizer level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Bruhat-Tits stratification of the reduced basic locus of regular ramified unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces of signature $(n\!-\!1,1)$ at vertex-stabilizer level. To study the Bruhat-Tits strata, we introduce strata models$\!-\!$simpler models that are \'{e}tale-locally isomorphic to each stratum. They admit two complementary characterizations: (i) as strict transforms under the blow-up of the local model at its worst point, and (ii) via a partial moduli description given by explicit linear-algebraic conditions; from these we deduce smoothness, explicit dimension formulas and irreducibility of the Bruhat-Tits strata.</description>

      <title>Primes Between Squares -- Commentary on Appendix 8 of Laws Of Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a commentary and guide to Appendix 8 of Laws Of Form, which is a chapter (appendix) on number theory in the book Laws of Form by Spencer-Brown. (Spencer-Brown,Laws Of Form,Revised Seventh English edition. Bohmeier Verlag. 2020) This chapter in the book provides Spencer-Brown's proofs of the conjecture that there are at least two prime numbers between any consecutive squared numbers. That there are primes between squares has been a conjecture in number theory since Legendre. In Spencer-Brown's appendix he gives his proofs of the conjecture. Those proofs are a highly original mixture of standard rigorous arguments and also some stated facts about the way numbers behave that would be considered conjectures by most number theorists. These phenomena are very interesting and constitute a deep observation about the nature of number itself. We intend that our guide will enable the reader to gain insight into Spencer-Brown's point of view and that our discussions will be of interest to anyone with curiosity about the theory of numbers.</description>

      <title>Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences for meromorphic modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970's, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer conjectured that Fourier coefficients of holomorphic modular cusp forms on noncongruence subgroups of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ satisfy certain $p$-adic recurrence relations which are analogous to Hecke's recurrence relations for congrunece subgroups. In 1985, this was proven in seminal work of Scholl and it was recently extended to weakly holomorphic modular forms by Kazalicki and Scholl. We show that Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer type congruences extend to the setting of meromorphic modular forms and that the $p$-adic recurrence relations arise from Scholl's congruences in addition to a contribution of fibers of universal elliptic curves at the poles. Moreover, when the poles are located at CM points, we exploit the CM structure to reduce these $p$-adic recurrence relations to $2$-term relations and we give explicit examples. Using this framework, we partially prove conjectures that certain meromorphic modular forms are magnetic.</description>

      <title>Parity distributions among gaps of free numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend recent results about the distribution of even and odd gaps of a numerical semigroup. We find that, for any numerical semigroup, the distribution can be computed in terms of the numbers of or the sums of odd and even elements in a corresponding Ap\'ery set. With free numerical semigroups specifically, we show that there are always at least as many odd gaps as even gaps, with equality precisely when the generating elements are all odd. We then specialize these results to the cases of numerical semigroups generated by compound sequences.</description>

      <title>On an spt function for the $4$-th symmetrized crank function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find the smallest part function related to the $4$-th symmetrized crank function, corresponding to the one obtained in Patkowski [11] for the $4$-th symmetrized rank function. This provides us with a direct relationship with Garvan's second order smallest part function. We obtain some congruences for these $spt$ functions, as well as asymptotics and inequalities. A finite $q$-series which generates an $spt$ function related to the second crank moment is also stated. This identity has an important relationship to the one obtained by Patkowski [12] related to the second rank moment.</description>

      <title>Rademacher-type exact formula and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for $r$-colored $\ell$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1937, Rademacher refined the circle method of Hardy and Ramanujan to derive an exact convergent series for the partition function $p(n)$. In 1942, Hua derived an exact formula for the distinct part partition function, and in 1971, Hagis generalized this result to the case of $\ell$-regular partitions. More recently, Iskander, Jain, and Talvola established a Rademacher-type exact formula for the $r$-colored partition function. In this paper, we employ the circle method to obtain a Rademacher-type exact formula for $r$-colored $\ell$-regular partitions for any $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\ell \geq 2$. As an application, we derive higher order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for the $r$-colored $\ell$-regular partition function using a result of Griffin, Ono, Rolen, and Zagier. Furthermore, as additional consequences, we establish Rademacher-type exact formulas and higher order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for the $r$-colored distinct part partition function and for the sum of minimal excludants over ordinary partitions and overpartitions.</description>

      <title>Levinson's theorem and its generalization for Dirichlet L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we present a proof of Levinson's theorem, following the ideas of Matthew P. Young in 2010, which states that one-third of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, i.e. the line Re(s) = 1/2, using a mollified second moment of the zeta-function. Later, we present a generalized result for Dirichlet L-functions by Xiaosheng Wu in 2018, using Levinson's method, showing that more than two-fifths of the non-trivial zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical line. Moreover, more than two-fifths of the non-trivial zeros are simple and on the critical line, using a longer mollifier than in Levinson's original proof. This generalizes a result by Conrey from 1989 that the Riemann zeta-function has at least two-fifths of its zeros on the critical line.</description>

      <title>On the absolute value of the autocorrelations of the Thue-Morse sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Baake and Coons proved several results on the average size of the autocorrelations of the Thue--Morse sequence. They also considered the absolute value of the autocorrelations, and showed that the average value of the autocorrelations is zero. In particular, they showed that $\sum_{n\leqslant x}|\eta(n)|=o(x^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha&gt;\log(3)/\log(4)$. In this paper, we sharpen this result, providing upper and lower bounds for $\alpha$. On the way to our lower bounds, we obtain the structure of the linear representation of the point-wise product of two $k$-regular sequences, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Ruelle-Mayer Transfer Operators for H\"older Continuous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of operators connected with the geodesic flow on the modular surface. We show certain spectral information is retained after expanding their domain to the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions on the unit interval. For example, the point spectra associated with the Maass cusp forms and non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann zeta function to the right of the critical line remain unchanged when the H\"older constant is $(1/2+\varepsilon)$ and $3/4$ respectively. We briefly consider a three-term functional equation introduced by Lewis in the H\"older setting and provide a partial classification of solutions in this setting.</description>

      <title>Linear independence of values of hypergeometric functions and arithmetic Gevrey series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new linear independence results for the values of generalized hypergeometric functions ${}_pF_q$ at several distinct algebraic points, over arbitrary algebraic number fields. Our approach combines constructions of type II Pad\'{e} approximants with a novel non-vanishing argument for generalized Wronskians of Hermite type. The method applies uniformly across all parameter regimes. Even for $p = q+1$, we extend known results from single-point to multi-point settings over general number fields, in the both complex and $p$-adic settings. When $p &lt; q+1$, we establish linear independence results over arbitrary number fields; and for $p &gt; q+1$, we confirm that the values do not satisfy global linear relations in the $p$-adic setting. Our results generalize and strengthen earlier work by Chudnovsky's, Nesterenko, Sorokin, Delaygue and others, and demonstrate the flexibility of our Pad\'{e} construction for families of contiguous hypergeometric values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain Atkin--Lehner decompositions for spaces of modular forms on definite quaternion algebras. Similar to Casselman's approach our methods are representation theoretic. Using Jacquet--Langlands correspondence we also obtain isomorphisms between spaces of quaternionic modular forms and corresponding spaces of Hilbert modular forms.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many supersingular primes for some Mumford's abelian fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elkies proved the infinitude of supersingular primes for elliptic curves over real number fields. We generalize Elkies' result to some abelian fourfolds in Mumford's families, and more generally, to certain families of Kuga-Satake abelian varieties. The proof relies on the study of local deformation spaces at closed points of the integral model of a Hodge-type Shimura variety, based on the work of Madapusi, and on the analysis of real points of a Shimura curve, based on the work of Shimura.</description>

      <title>\'Etale Fundamental Groups of Smooth Arithmetic Surfaces and the Grothendieck Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of the \'etale fundamental groups of smooth curves over certain arithmetic schemes, and investigate the relative version of Grothendieck's anabelian conjecture in this setting. Consequently, every hyperbolic curve over the ring of S-integers of a number field in which a rational prime is inverted is anabelian, i.e., its schematic structure is completely determined by its \'etale fundamental group. Moreover, we obtain a partial result toward the semi-absolute version of Grothendieck's anabelian conjecture in this context.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on smooth quartic and quintic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface of degree $d\ge 4$ defined over a number field $K$, and let $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)$ be the number of rational points of $X$ of height at most $B$ that do not lie on lines contained in $X$. Assuming a suitable hypothesis on the size of the rank of abelian varieties, we show that $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_X B^{4/3+\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This improves an unconditional and uniform bound from Salberger for $d=4$ and $d=5$. The proof, based on an argument of Heath-Brown, consists of cutting $X$ by projective planes and using a uniform version of Faltings's Theorem due to Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, to bound the number of rational points on the plane sections of $X$.</description>

      <title>Selberg Zeta Functions Have Second Moment At $\sigma = 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of the second moment of the Selberg zeta function for a Fuchsian group of the first kind at $\sigma = 1$. The prime geodesic theorem plays a crucial role in this context. The proof extends to Beurling zeta-functions satisfying a weak form of the Riemann hypothesis and to general Dirichlet series with positive coefficients, the partial sums of which are well-behaved. Note that by employing the recent approach of Broucke and Hilberdink in proving the second moment theorem, we can circumvent the separation condition introduced by Landau for general Dirichlet series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers subject to $(a,b)=1$. For $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, denote by $\tau_{a,b}(n;\ell_1,M_1,l_2,M_2)$ the asymmetric two--dimensional divisor function with congruence conditions, i.e., \begin{equation*} \tau_{a,b}(n;\ell_1,M_1,l_2,M_2)=\sum_{\substack{n=n_1^an_2^b\\ n_1\equiv\ell_1\!\!\!\!\!\pmod{M_1}\\ n_2\equiv\ell_2\!\!\!\!\!\pmod{M_2}}}1. \end{equation*} In this paper, we shall establish an asymptotic formula of the mean square of the error term of the sum $\sum_{n\leqslant M_1^aM_2^bx}\tau_{a,b}(n;\ell_1,M_1,l_2,M_2)$. This result constitutes an enhancement upon the previous result of Zhai and Cao [16].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f \in \mathbb Q[x]$ be a square-free polynomial of degree at least $3$, $m_i$, $i=1,2,3$, odd positive integers, and $a_i$, $i=1,2,3$, non-zero rational numbers. We show the existence of a rational function $D\in\mathbb{Q}(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ such that the Jacobian of the quadratic twist of $y^2=f(x)$ and the Jacobian of the $m_i$-twist, respectively $2m_i$-twist, of $y^2=x^{m_i}+a_i^2$, $i=1,2,3$, by $D$ are all of positive Mordell-Weil ranks. As an application, we present families of hyperelliptic curves with large Mordell-Weil rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $-1/2&lt;a&lt;0$ be a fixed real number and 
\begin{equation*} \Delta_{a}(x)=\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n\leq x} \sigma_a(n)-\zeta(1-a)x-\frac{\zeta(1+a)}{1+a}x^{1+a}+\frac{1}{2}\zeta(-a). \end{equation*} In this paper, we investigate the higher--power moments of $\Delta_a(x)$ and give the corresponding asymptotic formula for the integral $\int_{1}^{T}\Delta_a^k(x)\mathrm{d}x$, which constitutes an improvement upon the previous result of Zhai [9] for $k=3,4,5$ and an enlargement of the upper bound of $k$ to $7$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $c,d,\alpha,\beta$ are real numbers satisfying the inequalities $1&lt;d&lt;c&lt;39/37$ and $1&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;5^{1-d/c}$. In this paper, it is proved that, for sufficiently large real numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$ subject to $\alpha\leqslant N_2/N_1^{d/c}\leqslant\beta$, the following Diophantine inequalities system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \big|p_1^c+p_2^c+p_3^c+p_4^c+p_5^c-N_1\big|&lt;\varepsilon_1(N_1) \\ \big|p_1^d+p_2^d+p_3^d+p_4^d+p_5^d-N_2\big|&lt;\varepsilon_2(N_2) \end{cases} \end{equation*} is solvable in prime variables $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5$, where \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \varepsilon_1(N_1)=N_1^{-(1/c)(39/37-c)}(\log N_1)^{201}, \\ \varepsilon_2(N_2)=N_2^{-(1/d)(39/37-d)}(\log N_2)^{201}. \end{cases} \end{equation*} This result constitutes an improvement upon a series of previous results of Zhai [14] and Tolev [12].</description>

Abstract: We prove a substantial part of conjectures of Mazur and Tate that refine the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Our approach, which also leads to some results even finer than the predictions of Mazur and Tate, is via the `rank-zero component' of the relevant case of the equivariant Tamagawa Number conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015, Bachmann \cite{Ba3} conjectured that the~$\Q$-vector space~$\Zq$ of (formal)~$q$-analogues of Multiple Zeta Values (\qmzv s) is spanned by a very particular set compared to known spanning sets. In this work, we prove that this conjecture is true for a subspace of~$\Zq$ spanned by words satisfying some condition on their number of zeros and depth. According to this partial result, we give an explicit approach to the whole conjecture, based on particular~$\Q$-linear relations among formal Multiple~$q$-Zeta Values which are implied by duality.</description>

      <title>On the structure of modular principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over some finite rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The submodule structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, for $k$ a finite field of characteristic $p$, was described by Bardoe and Sin and has played an important role in subsequent work on the mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence. The present paper studies the structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O} / \mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic field $F$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. In particular, the multiset of Jordan-H\"older constituents is determined.
  In the case $n = 2$, more precise results are obtained. If $F / \mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is determined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$ is ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are determined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the principal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely related to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the structure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this provides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by Breuil and Pa\u{s}k\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise to supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial extensions of Raimi's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Given non-constant polynomials $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$, we construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove finite analogues in cyclic groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$, establishing quantitative bounds for Raimi-type intersections in finite settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Weng zeta functions associated with curves of genus 2 over finite fields. Building upon Weng's framework for non-abelian zeta functions, we establish that, as the rank n tends to infinity, the Riemann Hypothesis holds for these zeta functions. Our proof relies on the geometric properties of the moduli space of semi-stable bundles, together with several established results for high rank zeta functions, complemented by detailed asymptotic analysis. This result provides new evidence supporting the general validity of the Riemann Hypothesis for Weng zeta functions and offers insight into the analytic structure of non-abelian zeta functions associated with higher-genus curves.</description>

Abstract: Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\in (0,\infty)^n$, $\vec{\beta}=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^n$, $\vec{f}:=(f_1,\ldots, f_n)\in \mathcal{S}^n(\mathbb{R})$ and set $$H_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}(\vec{f})(x):=p.v. \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x+\beta_1 t^{\alpha_1})\ldots f_n(x+\beta_n t^{\alpha_n}) \frac{dt}{t}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\,,$$ with $\mathcal{M}_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}$ being its maximal operator counterpart. Assume that $1&lt;p_j&lt;\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}&lt;r&lt;\infty$ satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{p_j}=\frac{1}{r}$.
  Under the \emph{non-resonant} assumption that $\{\alpha_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are pairwise distinct we show that $$\|H_{3,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}(\vec{f})\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}} \prod_{j=1}^3\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}}\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \|\mathcal{M}_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}} \prod_{j=1}^n\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}} \qquad \forall\:n\geq 2\,.$$ (For the maximal operator the boundedness range can be extended to include the endpoint $\infty$ for both $p_j$ and $r$.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the connected components of arbitrary parahoric level affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties and local Shimura varieties, thus resolving a folklore conjecture in full generality (even for non-quasisplit groups). We achieve this by relating them to the connected components of infinite level moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas, where we use v-sheaf-theoretic techniques such as the specialization map of kimberlites. Along the way, we give a p-adic Hodge-theoretic characterization of HN-irreducibility. As applications, we obtain many results on the geometry of integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type at arbitrary stabilizer-parahoric levels. In particular, we deduce new CM lifting results on integral models of Shimura varieties for quasisplit groups at parahoric levels that arise as stabilizer Bruhat-Tits group schemes.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic cusp forms and the large sieve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a power saving upper bound for the sum of Fourier coefficients $\rho_f(\cdot)$ of a fixed cubic metaplectic cusp form $f$ over primes. Our result is the cubic analogue of a celebrated 1990 Theorem of Duke and Iwaniec, and the cuspidal analogue of a Theorem due to the author and Radziwill for the bias in cubic Gauss sums.
  The proof has two main inputs, both of independent interest. Firstly, we prove a new large sieve estimate for a bilinear form whose kernel function is $\rho_f(\cdot)$. The proof of the bilinear estimate uses a number field version of circle method due to Browning and Vishe, Voronoi summation, and Gauss-Ramanujan sums. Secondly, we use Voronoi summation and the cubic large sieve of Heath-Brown to prove an estimate for a linear form involving $\rho_f(\cdot)$. Our linear estimate overcomes a bottleneck occurring at level of distribution $2/3$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for lattice point counting on tessellated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the approach of Bj$\ddot{\text{o}}$rklund and Gorodnik, we have considered the discrepancy function for lattice point counting on domains that can be nicely tessellated by the action of a diagonal semigroup. We have shown that suitably normalized discrepancy functions for lattice point counting on certain tessellated domains satisfy a non-degenerate central limit theorem. Furthermore, we have also addressed the same problem for affine and congruence lattice point counting, proving analogous non-degenerate central limit theorems for them. The main ingredients of the proofs are the method of cumulants and quantitative multiple mixing estimates.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing and One Level Density for Dirichlet $L$-functions Along Short Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, it is known that at least half of the central values $L(\frac{1}{2},\chi)$ are non-vanishing as $\chi$ ranges over primitive characters modulo $q$. Unconditionally, this is known on average over both $\chi$ modulo $q$ and $Q/2 \leq q \leq 2Q$. We prove that for any $\delta&gt;0$, there exist $\eta_1,\eta_2&gt;0$ depending on $\delta$ such that the non-vanishing proportion for $L(\frac{1}{2},\chi)$ as $\chi$ ranges modulo $q$ with $q$ varying in short intervals of size $Q^{1-\eta_1}$ around $Q$ and in arithmetic progressions with moduli up to $Q^{\eta_2}$ is larger than $\frac{1}{2}-\delta$. Furthermore, by studying the one-level density of low-lying zeros of $L(s, \chi)$, we show that under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, non-vanishing proportions exceeding $\frac{1}{2}$ can be obtained while still averaging over short ranges of $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study partitions of totally positive integral elements $\alpha$ in a real quadratic field $K$. We prove that for a fixed integer $m \geq 1$, an element with $m$ partition exists in almost all $K$. We also obtain an upper bound for the norm of $\alpha$ that can be represented as a sum of indecomposables in at most $m$ ways, completely characterize the $\alpha$'s represented in exactly $2$ ways, and subsequently apply this result to complete the search for fields containing an element with $m$ partitions for $1 \leq m \leq 7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a recent result of Tong Liu, which gives a general control on the torsion in the graded pieces of the so-called integral Hodge filtration associated to a crystalline Galois lattice. Our approach is stack-theoretic, and is inspired on the one hand by a result of Gee--Kisin on the shape of mod $p$ crystalline Breuil--Kisin modules, and on the other hand by the structures seen on the diffracted Hodge complex studied by Bhatt--Lurie. Along the way, we also obtain an explicit description of the Hodge--Tate locus in the Nygaard stack $\mathcal{O}_K^{\mathcal{N}}$ for a general extension $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the sign constancy for the values of certain weighted summatory functions of the von Mangoldt function implies the Riemann hypothesis or the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions. While such sign constancy is challenging to establish individually, we prove that the summatory functions under study have constant signs on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and a pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions, we establish the truth of a conjecture of Montgomery (in its corrected form stated by Friedlander and Granville) on the magnitude of the error term in the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. As a consequence, we obtain that, under the same assumptions, the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture holds true. As another consequence, under the same assumptions, we will show that the number of Dirichlet characters $\chi \pmod{q}$ for which $L(\frac{1}{2},\chi)=0$ is of order less than $q^{1/2+\epsilon}$.</description>

Abstract: We say that a monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $N\ge 2$ is monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{N-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. In this article, we investigate the divisibility of the class numbers of quadratic fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{\delta})$ for certain families of monogenic trinomials $f(x)=x^N+Ax+B$, where $\delta\ne \pm 1$ is a squarefree divisor of the discriminant of $f(x)$.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic formula for the number of integral matrices with a fixed characteristic polynomial via orbital integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an irreducible polynomial $\chi(x)\in \mathcal{O}_k[x]$ of degree $n$, where $k$ is a number field and $\mathcal{O}_k$ its ring of integers, let $N(X, T)$ denote the number of $n \times n$ integral matrices whose characteristic polynomial is $\chi(x)$, bounded by a positive real number $T$ with respect to a certain norm. In this paper, we provide an asymptotic formula for $N(X,T)$ as $T\to \infty$ in terms of the orbital integrals of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. This result extends the work of A. Eskin, S. Mozes, and N. Shah \cite{EMS} (1996) to a broader setting, thereby further developing the generalization initiated by the second author in arXiv:2509.22314.
  Our approach is based on the interpretation of local Brauer evaluations for $X$ via local class field theory, and on the Langlands-Shelstad fundamental lemma for $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. In particular, we observe that local Brauer evaluations for $X$ determine local endoscopic data for $\mathrm{SL}_n$, suggesting a deeper conceptual connection between these two notions.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. If $p$ is large enough with respect to $[K:\mathbb{Q}_p]$ and under mild genericity assumptions, we prove that the admissible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ that occur in Hecke eigenspaces of the mod $p$ cohomology are of finite length. We also prove many new structural results about these representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ and their subquotients.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution Conditions for Gaps of Geometric Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2008, Wang \&amp; Wang showed that the set of gaps of a numerical semigroup generated by two coprime positive integers $a$ and $b$ is equidistributed modulo 2 precisely when $a$ and $b$ are both odd. Shor generalized this in 2022, showing that the set of gaps of such a numerical semigroup is equidistributed modulo $m$ when $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $m$ and at least one of them is 1 modulo $m$. In this paper, we further generalize these results by considering numerical semigroups generalized by geometric sequences of the form $a^k, a^{k-1}b, \dots, b^k$, aiming to determine when the corresponding set of gaps is equidistributed modulo $m$. With elementary methods, we are able to obtain a result for $k=2$ and all $m$. We then work with cyclotomic rings, using results about multiplicative independence of cyclotomic units to obtain results for all $k$ and infinitely many $m$. Finally, we take an approach with cyclotomic units and Dirichlet L-functions to obtain results for all $k$ and all $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new bound for short character sums in finite fields, particularly over two-dimensional grids in $\mathbb{F}_{p^3}$ and higher-dimensional lattices in $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$, extending an earlier work of Mei-Chu Chang on Burgess inequality in $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. In particular, we show that for intervals of size $p^{3/8+\varepsilon}$, the sum $\sum_{x, y} \chi(x + \omega y)$, with $\omega \in \mathbb{F}_{p^3} \setminus \mathbb{F}_p$, exhibits nontrivial cancellation uniformly in $\omega$. This is further generalized to codimension-one sublattices in $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$, and applied to obtain an alternative estimate for character sums on binary cubic forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $G$-homogeneous space over a number field $k$ such that $X\cong G_\gamma\backslash G$. Here, $G$ is a simply connected semisimple group over $k$ and $\gamma\in G(k)$ whose centralizer $G_\gamma$ is a maximal torus in $G$ which is anisotropic over $k$. We formulate the asymptotic for the number of integral points on $X$ bounded by a fixed norm $T&gt;0$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of $\kappa$-orbital integrals, which play a role in the stabilization of Arthur's trace formula. This formula coincides with the contribution of the stable conjugacy class of $\gamma$ to the geometric side of the trace formula.
  As an application, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of $n \times n$ matrices over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ whose characteristic polynomial equals a fixed irreducible polynomial $\chi(x)$ of degree $n$. This result generalizes a case studied by Eskin-Mozes-Shah (1996).</description>

These appear to be the first proved and reasonable irrationality measures for gamma quotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Katz's equidistribution framework, we show that for any squarefree polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]$ of degree $n \ge 2$, every residue class modulo $f$ can be represented as a product of two monic irreducible polynomials of degree at most $n$, provided $q$ is sufficiently large in terms of $n$. This gives the function-field analogue of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in the large-$q$ regime.
  Sawin previously proved this representation with stronger square-root cancellation via a higher-dimensional sheaf-theoretic construction. This note presents a one-dimensional argument that yields a natural $q^{-1/2}$ saving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey recent work done on the values at integer points of irrational inhomogeneous quadratic forms, namely, inhomogeneous analogues of the famous Oppenheim conjecture. We also prove that the set of such forms in two variables whose set of values at integer points avoids a given countable set not containing zero, has full Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we consider the more refined variant of this problem, where the shift is fixed and the form is allowed to vary. The strategy is to translate the problems to homogeneous dynamics and deduce the theorems from their dynamical counterparts. While our approach is inspired by the work of Kleinbock and Weiss, the dynamical results can be deduced from more general results of An, Guan, and Kleinbock.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</description>

      <title>Helson's conjecture for smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09982v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S\subset \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\times \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ or $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\ltimes \mathbb Z^2$ be finite symmetric and assume $S$ generates a group $G$ which is a Zariski-dense subgroup $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\times \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ or $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\ltimes \mathbb Z^2$. We prove that the Cayley graphs $$\{\mathcal Cay(G(\text{mod } q), S (\text{mod } q))\}_{q\in \mathbb Z}$$ form a family of expanders.</description>

      <title>Motivic Coh and Quot zeta functions of singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. We show that the a normalized high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions converges to the Coh zeta function. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Possible Sizes of Sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nathanson introduced the range of cardinalities of $h$-fold sumsets $R(h,k) := \{|hA|:A \subset \mathbb{Z} \text{ and }|A| = k\}.$ Following a remark of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'edi that determined the form of $R(h,k)$ when $h=2$, Nathanson asked what the form of $R(h,k)$ is for arbitrary $h, k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $h \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove there is some constant $k_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $k &gt; k_h$, then $R(h,k)$ is the entire interval $\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$ except for a specified set of $\binom{h-1}{2}$ numbers. Moreover, we show that one can take $k_3 = 2$.</description>
