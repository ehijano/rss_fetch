      <title>Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $&gt;$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $&gt;$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $&lt;$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $&gt;$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Semi-Implicit Continuum Kinetic Modeling of Weakly Collisional Parallel Transport in a Magnetic Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present implicit-explicit (IMEX) kinetic simulations of weakly collisional parallel plasma transport in magnetic mirror configurations using the continuum code \textsc{COGENT}. The numerical scheme employs a Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning to overcome the severe time-step limitations imposed by strong mirror forces in fully explicit schemes. Applied to parameters relevant to the WHAM mirror experiment, the IMEX approach enables time steps up to $2.5 \times 10^4$ times larger than those permitted by explicit methods, resulting in a 2500x speedup in 1D--2V simulations of parallel transport with kinetic ions and Boltzmann electrons. Additionally, a reduced bounce-averaged model for a square mirror is implemented to support the computationally intensive fully kinetic simulations. The bounce-averaged formulation is used to evaluate the numerical convergence of the velocity-space discretization algorithms and to assess the role of the collision model by comparing simulations employing the nonlinear Fokker--Planck and the simplified Lenard--Bernstein--Dougherty collision operators.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between plasma triangularity and micro-tearing turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the interplay between triangularity and micro-tearing turbulence using linear and nonlinear flux tube GENE simulations. We consider scenarios with negative and positive triangularity plasma shaping taken from existing tokamaks (TCV, DIII-D, MAST-U and SMART) and EU-DEMO. The study of all these tokamaks reveals a coherent picture. Negative triangularity geometry is more susceptible to micro-tearing modes (MTM), which, when present, make transport much worse than in positive triangularity. At sufficiently large $\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure over magnetic pressure), magnetic shear and ratio of electron to ion temperature gradient, all the scenarios with negative triangularity are dominated by MTM turbulence. In contrast, the corresponding scenarios with positive triangularity remain dominated by electrostatic turbulence and MTMs are subdominant or stable. We observe that conventional tokamaks usually operate in a parameter space far away from the onset of this MTM-dominated regime in negative triangularity, thus preserving the beneficial effect of negative triangularity on turbulent transport. In contrast, spherical tokamaks operate close to this regime and may ultimately exhibit worse transport at negative triangularity than positive triangularity. We find that lowering the magnetic shear in spherical tokamaks can preserve the beneficial effect of negative triangularity on electrostatic turbulence and prevent strong MTM transport. Finally, linear and nonlinear simulations reveal the reason for stronger MTMs: the magnetic drifts are faster in the negative triangularity geometry.</description>

      <title>Hybrid fluid-kinetic cylindrical equilibria with axial background magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistent, one-dimensional quasineutral screw-pinch equilibria are constructed within a hybrid model that couples fluid electrons with kinetic ions governed by the Vlasov equation. The equilibria depend on the radial coordinate perpendicular to the cylindrical axis and include an axial background magnetic field. Adopting a three-parameter ion distribution function depending on the energy and the canonical momenta conjugate to the two ignorable coordinates, the problem is reduced to a set of four quasilinear ODEs which are solved numerically. Both static equilibria and equilibria with macroscopic ion sheared velocities are obtained. The pressure of the electron fluid is isotropic and the electron contribution to the current density is parallel to the magnetic field, while the kinetic ions are associated with a non-gyrotropic pressure tensor. By means of the solutions the various equilibrium quantities are calculated and the impact of the free parameters on the equilibrium characteristics is examined.</description>

      <title>Multi-Machine Scaling Laws for Fuel and Impurity Puffing Rates Sufficient for Detachment Access: a Systematic Review of Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a database of 457 experimental and numerical data from 32 machines among solid-walled tokamaks, stellarators and linear plasma devices, we derive physics-informed multi-machine scaling laws predictive of fuel and impurity puffing rates sufficient to access plasma detachment -- leading candidate for a reactor-relevant solution to the open issue of plasma-wall interaction. Validation of our laws in up to 40 plasmas in low- and high-confinement mode also featuring advanced configurations demonstrates accuracy within a factor 1.5 in up to 50% of the instances, and within a factor 2 on average. Divertor volume alone is found to correlate to fuelling. The addition of plasma opaqueness leads to the empirically-calibrated law $\Gamma_{\text{D}}\propto [n_{\text{sep}}\times a\times(S_{\text{div}}/V_{\text{div}})^{-1.5}]^{1.05}$ valid across all toroidal devices. Its simplification to $\Gamma_{\text{D}}^{\text{HDL}}\propto 0.43\times a^{1.58}\times\lambda_q^{-0.89}$ avoids a dependence on $n_{\text{sep}}$ and bears intrinsic significance provided by the H/L density limit and the power fall-off length. Non-linearities of the impurity dynamics manifest in the seeding rate -- which the present work identifies both a generalised formula for, and the Greenwald-Eich-Scarabosio simplification $\Gamma_{\text{Z}}^{\text{GES}}\propto a^{1.51}\times\lambda_q^{-0.27}$. Similar relationships are defined for stellarators, closely following the mainstream but without providing data for validation -- which should stimulate further investigations. In the era of nuclear fusion reactor design, these results find immediate applicability in informing reactor fuel cycle design and edge plasma modelling. More generally, this study demonstrates that physics-based laws able to relate detachment to engineering actuators exist, and pave the way for analytical models bridging to the true inputs of experimental operation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing ion-acoustic shock wave collisions in Martian multicomponent plasma environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical investigation of colliding ion-acoustic (IA) shock waves in Martian multicomponent plasmas consisting of hydrogen ($H^+$), oxygen ($O^+$) and oxygen molecule ($O_2^+$) ions, including background superthermal electrons (modeled by a $\kappa$-(kappa) distribution function). A set of Burgers' equations is obtained by adopting a modified Poincar\'e-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK) perturbation method to describe the head-on-collision dynamics of dissipative nonlinear IA wave structures. We have estimated the spatio-temporal scales using parameters typically observed in the Martian atmosphere by the MAVEN spacecraft, for which shock waves are theoretically expected to undergo mutual collisions in the multicomponent plasma. The effects of head-on collisions on the electrostatic potential profiles arising from one-fold and two-fold IA shock interactions are explored. Our numerical analysis reveals that the collision leads to a noticeable broadening of the shock structures with the enhancement of kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Studies for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB Plasma Beam Driven Working Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a plasma based user facility on the model of EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB requires to design a working point for the operation that allows to get an high accelerating gradient preserving a low emittance and low energy spread of the accelerated beam. Such beam is supposed to pilot a soft x-ray free electron laser with a wavelength of 2-\SI{4}{\nano\meter}. In this work several simulation scans are presented, varying at the same time the plasma density and driver-witness separation in order to show that, in a realistic working point for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\_LAB, it is possible to find an ideal compromise for a witness with a peak current &gt;1kA that allows to preserve the energy spread of the core (80\% of the charge) below 0.1\%, while maintaining an accelerating gradient inside the plasma module around of 1 GV/m. The study is completed with a parametric analysis with the aim of establishing the stability requirements of the RF working point and the plasma channel in order to preserve the energy jitter at the same level of the energy spread.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spatially resolved measurements of helium metastable densities by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy in atmospheric pressure RF plasma jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium metastable species play a critical role in sustaining radio-frequency (RF) driven micro atmospheric pressure plasma jets through Penning ionization and for the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Their densities are typically measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). Most spatially resolved TDLAS approaches rely on mechanical scanning of a narrow laser beam across the plasma, which is time-consuming and limits spatial resolution. In this work, we present an advanced two-dimensional (2D) TDLAS method that enables direct spatial mapping of helium metastable densities without the need for mechanical scanning. A rotating optical diffuser is employed to suppress speckle interference and generate uniform illumination across the plasma region. The absorption profile is captured using a short-wavelength infrared camera equipped with a telecentric lens, achieving high spatial resolution (approximately 10 {\mu}m) across the entire field of view. This approach significantly enhances both data quality and acquisition speed. The improved 2D TDLAS system is applied to measure helium metastable densities in plasma jets with structured electrodes driven by different tailored voltage waveforms. The results show very good qualitative agreement with fluid simulations and previously reported experimental data.</description>

      <title>Plasma pressure response to non-inductive current drive in axisymmetric visco-resistive MHD steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate self-consistent, steady-state axisymmetric solutions of incompressible tokamak plasma using a visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic model. A key contribution of this work is the formulation of Poisson's equation that governs the pressure profile. Our analysis reveals that the current modeling fails to produce realistic pressure levels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce additional non-inductive current drives, akin to those generated by neutral beam injection or radio frequency heating, modeled as modifications to the toroidal current. Numerical simulations validate our enhanced model, showing significant improvements in pressure profile characteristics. In the cases examined, the effect of these current drives on the velocity profiles is moderate, except when the non-inductive current drives induce reversals in the total toroidal current density, leading to non-nested flux surfaces with internal separatrices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced beam transport via space charge mitigation in a multistage accelerator for fusion plasma diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient transport of high-current negative ion beams is critical for accurate plasma potential diagnostics using heavy-ion beam probe (HIBP) systems in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. However, strong space-charge effects often degrade transport efficiency, particularly for heavy ions such as Au-. In this study, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in beam transport by introducing an electrostatic lens effect through optimized voltage allocation in a multistage acceleration system. Numerical simulations using IGUN, supported by experiments with the LHD-HIBP system, show that this approach effectively suppresses space-charge-induced beam divergence and loss. Without requiring mechanical modifications to the beamline, the optimized configuration enables a 2-3 fold increase in Au-beam current injected into the tandem accelerator. Consequently, plasma potential measurements were extended to higher-density plasmas, reaching line-averaged electron densities up to $1.75\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ with improved signal-to-noise ratio. This technique offers a compact, practical, and highly effective solution for transporting high-current heavy-ion beams under space-charge-dominated conditions. Beyond its impact on plasma diagnostics, the method is broadly applicable to a wide range of accelerator systems, including those used in scientific and industrial applications where high-intensity beam transport is required.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Particle Transport for Enhanced Confinement in Quasi-Isodynamic Stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in reducing turbulent heat losses, modern quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarators -- such as Stellaris -- continue to suffer from poor particle confinement, which fundamentally limits their overall performance. Using gyrokinetic simulations within the GENE--Tango framework, we identify suppressed inward thermodiffusion, caused by unfavorable magnetic geometry, as the primary cause. To overcome this limitation, we design a new configuration with a reduced mirror ratio, which enhances the contribution of passing electrons to the inward particle flux. This facilitates the formation of strongly peaked density profiles, suppresses turbulence, and leads to a substantial improvement in confinement. Our optimized configuration achieves nearly a twofold increase in energy confinement compared to Stellaris, highlighting the crucial role of optimizing particle transport in next-generation stellarator designs.</description>

      <title>Terahertz frequency conversion at plasma-induced time boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the frequency conversions of terahertz (THz) waves at ultrafast time boundaries created via femtosecond laser-induced air-to-plasma phase transitions. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals that the abrupt change in refractive index at the ultrafast time boundaries drives both the red and blue shifts over the broadband THz spectrum due to the dispersive plasma, with distinctive amplitude variations. The present study contrasts these effects with those from spatial boundaries, highlighting the superior efficacy of temporal manipulations for spectral engineering. These findings not only deepen the understanding of light-matter interactions in time-varying media but also pave the way for innovative applications in THz technology and lay the groundwork for the observation of temporal reflection effects, photonic time crystals, and spatio-temporally modulated matter.</description>

      <title>3D non-linear MHD simulations of core density collapse event in LHD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new three-dimensional, non-linear Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model has been extended in MIPS code, incorporating parallel heat diffusivity. The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model used in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC) observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the developed model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for a typical super dense core discharge in LHD, with vacuum magnetic axis configuration RaxV = 3.85 m and magnetic axis beta \beta0 = 4% plasma. This configuration corresponds to a plasma with a steep pressure gradient and strong Shafranov shift, which makes the plasma potentially unstable in the LHD. The model shows preliminary characteristics of the CDC event. The plasma is destabilized by high-n ballooning modes in the low-field side region during the linear regime, eventually leading to the collapse of the pressure and density profiles, together with the stochastization of the magnetic field and a shift to low-n modes centered at the core of the plasma after the non-linear coupling at the relaxation regime.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>

Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Neoclassical Tearing Mode Detection by ECE Radiometry in Tokamak Reactors via Asymptotic Matching Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TJ toroidal tearing mode code is used to make realistic predictions of the electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals generated by neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) in an ITER-like tokamak plasma equilibrium. In the so-called "outer region'', which comprises the bulk of the plasma, helical harmonics of the magnetic field with the same toroidal mode number as the NTM, but different poloidal mode numbers, are coupled together by the Shafranov shifts and shaping of the equilibrium magnetic flux-surfaces. In the "inner region'', which is localized in the vicinity of the NTM rational surface, helical harmonics whose poloidal and toroidal mode numbers are in the same ratio as those of the NTM are coupled together nonlinearly to produce a radially asymmetric magnetic island chain. The solutions in the inner and outer regions are asymptotically matched to one another. The asymptotic matching process determines the overall magnetic structure of the NTM, as well as the global perturbation to the electron temperature caused by the mode. A simulated ECE diagnostic is developed that accounts for the downshifting and broadening in frequency of the signal due to the relativistic mass increase of the emitting electrons.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>
