      <title>Enhancement of hole mobility in high-rate reactively sputtered Cu2O thin films induced by laser thermal annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In presented work, a reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (r-HiPIMS) was used for high-rate deposition ( 170 nm/min) of Cu2O films. Films were deposited on a standard soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate at a temperature of 190C. As-deposited films exhibit poor hole mobility in the orders of 1 cm2/Vs. We have systematically studied the effect of laser thermal annealing (LTA) procedure performed using high-power infrared laser under different laser parameters (number of pulses, length of the pulse). We have found, LTA procedure could significantly enhance the hole mobility (up to 24 cm2/Vs in our case). We have also fitted the results of a temperature-dependent Hall measurement to clarify the mechanism of the reported increase in hole mobility. Moreover, we have discussed the effect of the LTA procedure on microstructure (crystallinity, surface morphology) and on the value of optical band gap.</description>

      <title>A prelude to the multibeam photoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The report focuses on the introduction and validation of photoacoustics measurements in the presence of two simultaneous probing beams. The experiments, performed for three model systems: a perfect absorber - carbon black membrane, a multilayer system - acrylic paint-covered copper plate, and luminescent sample - ruby, were aimed for comparative analyses of frequency domain photoacoustic responses to a single probing beam (classical approach) and two probing beams (of different wavelengths). A modulation frequency shift criterion, allowing for the simultaneous acquisition of two independent signals, was recognized. Any synergistic or cross effects of sample dual beam excitation on the photoacoustic signal generation (impacts of the beams intensities or modulation frequency effects) were not observed. The multibeam photoacoustics data appears to be (at least) equivalent to classically acquired results for stationary systems. It is considered, that the multibeam approach will broaden the applicability of the photothermal methods to the time-dependent systems, where the evolutions of distinct absorption bands is of special interest.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian magnonic knobbing between electromagnetically induced reflection and transparancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation of wave propagation through open resonant systems has attracted tremendous interest. When accessible to the open system, the system under study is prone to tempering to out of equilibrium, and a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception. Open systems correspond to non-hermitian Hamiltonians with very unique properties such as resulting exceptional points and ideal isolation. Here, we have found a highly sensitive modulation for the intersection of resonant patch antennas with respect to cavity magnonic coupling by means of an open coupling system of three resonant modes. Two types of crossings are implemented in this study: the first type of crossing remotely controls the sharp switching of the transmission line 's transmittance, while regulating the repulsive behavior of its zero-reflection states. The second type of crossing corresponds to the modulation of non-reciprocal phase transitions, which enables a more desirable isolation effect. Three different coupling models are realized by a non-Hermitian scattering Hamiltonian, revealing distinct spatial overlaps between modes. This elucidates that dissipative coupling of at least two modes to the environment is crucial for non-reciprocal transport. Our work not only reveals the versatility of cavity magnonic systems but also provides a way to design functional devices for general wave optics using patch antenna crossings.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved lock-in micro-thermography (SR-LIT): A tensor analysis-enhanced method for anisotropic thermal characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high-throughput (HT) computations have streamlined the discovery of promising new materials, experimental characterization remains challenging and time-consuming. One significant bottleneck is the lack of an HT thermal characterization technique capable of analyzing advanced materials exhibiting varying surface roughness and in-plane anisotropy. To tackle these challenges, we introduce spatially resolved lock-in micro-thermography (SR-LIT), an innovative technique enhanced by tensor analysis for optical thermal characterization. Our comprehensive analysis and experimental findings showcase notable advancements: We present a novel tensor-based methodology that surpasses the limitations of vector-based analysis prevalent in existing techniques, significantly enhancing the characterization of arbitrary in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors. On the instrumental side, we introduce a straightforward camera-based detection system that, when combined with the tensor-based methodology, enables HT thermal measurements. This technique requires minimal sample preparation and enables the determination of the entire in-plane thermal conductivity tensor with a single data acquisition lasting under 40 seconds, demonstrating a time efficiency over 90 times superior to state-of-the-art HT thermology. Additionally, our method accommodates millimeter-sized samples with poor surface finish, tolerating surface roughness up to 3.5 {\mu}m. These features highlight an innovative approach to realizing HT and accurate thermal characterization across various research areas and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Super-Resolution Flow Mapping in Liquid Metals using Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection of liquid metals drives large natural processes and is important in technical processes. Model experiments are conducted for research purposes where simulations are expensive and the clarification of open questions requires novel flow mapping methods with an increased spatial resolution. In this work, the method of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is investigated for this purpose. Known from microvasculature imaging, this method provides an increased spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Its applicability in liquid metal flows is promising, however the realization and reliability is challenging, as artificial scattering particles or microbubbles cannot be utilized. To solve this issue an approach using nonlinear adaptive beamforming is proposed. This allowed the reliable tracking of particles of which super-resolved flow maps can be deduced. Furthermore, the application in fluid physics requires quantified results. Therefore, an uncertainty quantification model based on the spatial resolution, velocity gradient and measurement parameters is proposed, which allows to estimate the flow maps validity under experimental conditions. The proposed method is demonstrated in magnetohydrodynamic convection experiments. In some occasions, ULM was able to measure velocity vectors within the boundary layer of the flow, which will help for future in-depth flow studies. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty model of ULM is of generic use in other applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>Transverse Inscription of Silicon Waveguides by Picosecond Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, picosecond laser inscription of segmented waveguides in crystalline silicon based on a deterministic single-pulse modification process is demonstrated.Pulses of 43 ps duration at 1.55 ${\mu}$m wavelength are used to transversely inscribe periodic structures with a pulse-to-pulse pitch of around 2 ${\mu}$m. Infrared shadowgraphy images and Raman spectroscopy measurements indicate that the modifications exhibit a spherical shape. Characterization of waveguide performance at 1.55 ${\mu}$m for various pulse energies and periods is carried out. Direct comparison with numerical simulations confirms the presence of graded index waveguides, encompassing a micrometer core size and a maximum refractive index change of around $7\times 10^{-3}$. This short-pulse inscription approach can pave the way for three-dimensional integrated photonic devices in the bulk of silicon.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular charge transfer enhances the performance of molecular rectifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular-scale diodes made from self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) could complement silicon-based technologies with smaller, cheaper, and more versatile devices. However, advancement of this emerging technology is limited by insufficient electronic performance exhibited by the molecular current rectifiers. We overcome this barrier by exploiting the charge-transfer state that results from co-assembling SAMs of molecules with strong electron donor and acceptor termini. We obtain a substantial enhancement in current rectification, which correlates with the degree of charge transfer, as confirmed by several complementary techniques. These findings provide a previously unexplored method for manipulating the properties of molecular electronic devices by exploiting donor/acceptor interactions. They also serve as a model test platform for the study of doping mechanisms in organic systems. Our devices have the potential for fast widespread adoption due to their low-cost processing and self-assembly onto silicon substrates, which could allow seamless integration with current technologies.</description>

      <title>Achromatic Full Stokes Polarimetry Metasurface for Full-color Polarization Imaging in the Visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of anisotropic subwavelength structures provide an ultrathin platform for a compact, real-time polarimeter. However, applications in polychromatic scenes are restricted by the limited operating bandwidths and degraded imaging quality due to the loss of spectral information. Here, we demonstrated full-color polarization imaging based on an achromatic polarimeter consisting of four polarization-dependent metalenses. Boosted by an intelligent design scheme, arbitrary phase compensation and multi-objective matching are effectively compatible with a limited database. Broadband achromaticity for wavelengths ranging from 450 nm to 650 nm, with a relative bandwidth of nearly 0.435, is achieved for the full Stokes imaging. The experimental polarization reconstructed errors for operating wavelengths of 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm are 7.5%, 5.9%, and 3.8%, respectively. The full-color and full-polarization imaging capability of the device is also verified with a customized object. The proposed scheme paves the way for further developing polarization imaging toward practical applications.</description>

      <title>FDTD-based Inverse Design enables f/0.27 flat Microlens Array for Integral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-NA (0.88), ultra-low-f-number (f/0.2714), multi-wavelength (480nm, 550nm and 650nm) multilevel diffractive MicroLens Array (MLA) using inverse design. Each microlens in the array is close-packed with diameter of 70 {\mu}m and focal length of only 19 {\mu}m in air. The MLA was patterned on one surface of a polymer film via UV casting, such that the focal plane was located on the distal end of the film (n of polymer ~ 1.47, thickness = 28 {\mu}m, effective f/# (NA) inside polymer ~ 0.4 (0.78)). Each microlens focuses incident light at 3 design wavelengths into a focal spot with measured full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) &lt; 1 {\mu}m. By placing this MLA directly on a high-resolution print, we demonstrated RGB integral imaging with applications in document security. Compared to refractive MLAs, our diffractive MLA reduces the thickness by &gt; 3X, which is advantageous for manufacturability. Since these multi-level diffractive MLAs are fabricated using UV-casting, they have the potential for low-cost, high-volume manufacturing.</description>

      <title>A guide to numerical dispersion curve calculations: explanation, interpretation and basic Matlab code</title>

Abstract: Dispersion diagrams play a crucial role in examining, analyzing and designing wave propagation in periodic structures. Despite their ubiquity and current research interest, introductory papers and reference scripting tailored to novel researchers in the field are lacking. This paper aims to address this gap, by presenting a comprehensive educational resource for researchers starting in the field of periodic structures and more specifically on the study of dispersion relations captured by dispersion surfaces or curves in dispersion diagrams. The objective is twofold. A first objective is to give a detailed explanation of dispersion diagrams, with graphical illustrations. Secondly, a documented Matlab code is provided to compute dispersion curves of 3D structures with 2D periodicity using the so-called inverse approach. These dispersion curves are obtained with numerical simulations using the finite element method. The code is written for elastic wave propagation and orthogonal periodicity directions, but can be extended to other types of linear wave propagation, non-orthogonal periodicity directions or 1D and 3D periodicity. The aim of this code is to serve as a starting point for novice researchers in the field, to facilitate their understanding of different aspects of dispersion diagrams and serve as a stepping stone in their future research.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Strategy for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nitrogen-targeting-Proton-Carbon-Alpha-Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. Monte Carlo simulations validated the effectiveness of the Proton-CAT, and the study specifically focused on the distribution of relative energy deposition. The results indicated that the presence of nitrogen-15 enhanced the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions has shown that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the production efficiencies of carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles. Furthermore, it has been revealed that elevating the nitrogen-15 concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and $\alpha$ particles within the tumor region. The present work would contribute to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework to investigate and predict the complicated multiphase properties of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for sustainable technological progress. Although their electromechanical properties vary by phase, lead-free piezoelectric materials show a considerable thermo-electromechanical response. Lead-free materials such as Bi$_{0.5}$Na$_{0,5}$TiO$_{3}$ (BNT) and other BNT-type piezoelectric materials transition to rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases with temperature variation. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Multiple phases can occur simultaneously under specific thermal, electrical, and mechanical conditions, leading in complex multiphase behaviour. These materials' performance must be assessed by studying such behaviour. This study uses Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to simulate material micro-domain phase transitions. The computational model for BNT-type piezoelectric material covers temperature-induced ferroelectric domain switching and phase transitions. Therefore, the developed computational approach will assist us in better understanding the influence of these materials' complex multiphase behaviour on creating sustainable solutions with green technologies.</description>
