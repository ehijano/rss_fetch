      <title>Weak Independence and Coupled Parallelism in Biological Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Biological Petri Nets (Bio-PNs) model biochemical pathways where multiple reactions simultaneously affect shared metabolites through convergent production or regulatory coupling. However, classical Petri net independence theory requires transitions to share no places -- a constraint that fails to capture biological reality. This mismatch prevents parallel simulation and incorrectly flags biologically valid models as structurally problematic.
  Results: To resolve this fundamental limitation, we introduce weak independence -- a novel formalization distinguishing resource conflicts from biological coupling. Building on this theory, we extend the Bio-PN definition from a classical 5-tuple to a 12-tuple by adding regulatory structure, environmental exchange classification, dependency taxonomy, heterogeneous transition types, and biochemical formula tracking. This extended formalism enables systematic classification of three place-sharing modes: competitive (conflict), convergent (superposition), and regulatory (read-only). Validating our approach on 100 diverse BioModels (1,775 species, 2,234 reactions across metabolism, signaling, and gene regulation), we find that 96.93% of transition pairs exhibit weak independence -- confirming that biological networks inherently favor cooperation over competition. Our SHYpn implementation demonstrates the practical impact, achieving up to 2.6x speedup on 30% of evaluated models.

      <title>Piezo1 Decodes Mechanical Forces via Allosteric Network Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how molecular machines transduce mechanical force into chemical signals is a central goal in chemistry. The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is an archetypal nanoscale mechanotransducer, but the molecular principles by which it decodes distinct mechanical stimuli remain elusive. Here, we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with time-series causal inference to elucidate the dynamic allosteric communication networks within Piezo1 under both quasi-static membrane tension and shockwave-induced cavitation. Under tangential tension, Piezo1 employs the lever-like pathway, a linear, feed-forward pathway propagating the signal from peripheral mechanophores to the central pore. In contrast, a shockwave impulse in the normal direction triggers a two-stage gating mechanism based on the dynamic reprogramming of the allosteric network. An initial compression phase activates an apical shortcut pathway originating from the cap domain. A subsequent tension phase utilizes a rewired network with complex feedback loops to drive the channel to a fully open state. These findings reveal that the allosteric wiring of a molecular machine is not static but can be dynamically reconfigured by the nature of the physical input. This principle of force-dependent pathway selection offers a new framework for understanding mechanochemistry and for designing programmable, stimuli-responsive molecular systems.</description>

      <title>On the abelian structure of noncompetitive chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are foundational models for describing complex biochemical processes. We study noncompetitive CRNs, a class of networks whose static states are rate-independent, and that can implement ReLU neural networks. A central contribution of this work is that noncompetitive CRNs are special instances of Abelian networks (ANs) a well-established framework for self-organized criticality. CRNs of interest in biochemistry and systems biology are embedded in complex networks so that local CRNs have to respond to internal and environmental cues. We describe the network's response to such perturbations using a sandpile Markov chain whose state space is the set of CRN's static states, from where no reaction is possible. The addition of molecules to a static state induces reactions that move the system into a new static state. For noncompetitive CRNs of finite state space, we use AN theory to get that the fraction of static states that are recurrent is in one to one correspondence with the critical group of the AN.
  Overall, this work establishes a unified algebraic and probabilistic framework for analyzing the long-term behavior of noncompetitive CRNs.</description>

      <title>Design of a minimal, allosteric, and ATPase-like machine using mechanical linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ATPases cyclically convert chemical energy in the form of ATP gradients into directed motion inside cells. To function, ATPases rely on allosteric communication between at least two binding sites, an internal signaling mechanism that is not well understood. Here, we model an ATPase-like machine by using a system of mechanical linkages to recreate negative allosteric coupling between two binding sites and generate cycles in which the sites alternate occupancy. The ATPase analog has two mechanical degrees of freedom and two discretized binding sites: one for the ATP, Pi and ADP analogs, and one for an allosteric effector analog. The geometry of the ATPase analog allows stepwise binding reactions at each site to capture the two degrees of freedom in a mutually exclusive way. Consequently, the enzyme interconverts between multiple rigid and partially rigid forms, such that neither site can be fully bound when both sites are occupied. Two mechanisms work together to generate an enzymatic cycle: one, in which the tighter-binding ATP analog can bind and displace the effector from the enzyme; and a second, in which flexibility introduced by splitting the ATP analog into two pieces (catalysis) allows the effector to rebind and displace the products (ADP analog). We show that cleavage (forward catalysis) and ligation (reverse catalysis) alter the rigidity of the enzyme complex equivalently to binding and dissociation, respectively, but must do so more slowly for effective cycling to take place. Simple designs for synthetic systems that mimic ATPase monomers can be derived from this work.</description>
