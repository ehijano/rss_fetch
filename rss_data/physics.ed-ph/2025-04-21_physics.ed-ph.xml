      <title>Utilizing Optic Fiber Interferometry in Forced Vibration Experimentation for Educational Purposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an experimental teaching method that employs optic fiber interferometry (OFI) to investigate forced vibration phenomena. It is designed for undergraduate physics majors with foundational mechanics and optics training and optics-focused graduate students. This approach aims to deepen students' understanding of forced vibration theory and interferometric measurement principles while fostering skills in experimental design, data analysis, and problem solving. Leveraging OFI's high-precision displacement measurement capabilities, the experiment enabled accurate tracking of frequency and displacement variations. By scanning the driving force frequency, students obtained amplitude frequency curves to determine the system's natural frequency, which closely aligned with theoretical predictions. This method may bridge theoretical concepts and practical applications, offering insights into teaching vibration theory and precision measurement techniques and equipping students with integrated knowledge for real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Assessing physics quantitative literacy development in algebra-based physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative reasoning is an essential learning objective of physics instruction. The Physics Inventory for Quantitative Literacy (PIQL) is an assessment tool that has been developed for calculus-based physics courses to help instructors evaluate whether their students learn to reason this way (White Brahmia, et al., 2019). However, the PIQL is not appropriate for the large population of students taking physics who are not enrolled in, or have not completed, calculus. To address this need, we have developed the General Equation-based Reasoning inventory of QuaNtity (GERQN). The GERQN is an algebra-based version of the PIQL and is appropriate for most physics students; the only requirement is that students have taken algebra so they are familiar with the use of variable, negative quantities, and linear functions. In this paper we present the development and validation of the GERQN, and a short discussion on how the GERQN can be used by instructors to help their students learn.</description>
