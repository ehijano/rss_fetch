      <title>Evidence of partonic collectivity in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions with NCQ scaling of radial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of \textit{Number of Constituent Quark} (NCQ) scaling of the radial flow observable $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV are investigated using the string-melting version of the \texttt{AMPT} model, while Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV are analyzed using published ALICE data, with calculations from \texttt{PYTHIA8/Angantyr} serving as a non-collective baseline. The $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})$ spectra from \texttt{AMPT-SM} exhibit clear collective signatures, including mass ordering at lower-$p_{\rm T}$ and a meson-baryon separation at intermediate-$p_{\rm T}$, which are absent in the baseline calculations. In central collisions, $v_{0}(p_{\rm T})/n_q$ follows robust NCQ scaling when expressed as a function of transverse kinetic energy per quark, $(m_{\rm T}-m_{0})/n_q$, while significant deviations emerge toward peripheral events, indicating a stronger manifestation of collectivity in central collisions. The scaling is more precise at RHIC than at LHC energies, consistent with earlier observations for elliptic flow $v_2$. These findings provide strong evidence that radial collectivity is established predominantly at the partonic stage of the fireball evolution.</description>

      <title>Triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in mass-8 proton-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in A=8 nuclei has been demonstrated. Two of these are the ground state of 8C and its isobaric analog state in 8B, both of which are analogs of the halo or thick-skinned nucleus 8He. The third member is the recently found fourth 1+ state in 8B. This new 8B state at E*=8.4 MeV was observed to decay to the ground state of 6Li by 2p emission. Momentum correlations between the decay products indicate that it is not a sequential 2p decay through a 7Be intermediate state, but indicative of prompt 2p emission with correlations similar to those of the other members of the triplet. Ab initio calculations with the symmetry-adapted nocore shell model indicate that these three states have very similar spatial wavefunctions, but with nucleons coupling to different spins, isospins, and isospin projections. The triplet of 2p emitters all have oblate shapes and by stripping two protons equatorially, decay to states which have prolate shapes.</description>

      <title>Prediction of deformed halo nuclei $^{43,45}$Si from multiple criteria based on structure and reaction analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible deformed neutron halos in silicon isotopes are investigated from both structure and reaction perspectives using the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) combined with the Glauber model. The experimental neutron separation energies of silicon isotopes are well reproduced by the DRHBc theory. Multiple halo criteria are examined, including the global ones based on root-mean-square radii and density profiles, as well as the microscopic ones based on single-particle orbitals and their spatial distributions. Calculations employing different density functionals and pairing strengths consistently indicate the emergence of $p$-wave neutron halos in $^{43,45}$Si, accompanied by pronounced shape decoupling between the halo and the core. Moreover, the enhanced reaction cross sections and the narrow longitudinal momentum distributions of one-neutron removal residues provide additional evidence supporting the halo structures in $^{43,45}$Si.</description>

      <title>ANUBIS: Projected Sensitivities and Initial Results from the proANUBIS demonstrator with Run 3 LHC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of the Standard Model (SM) there remains behaviour it cannot describe, in particular the presence of non-interacting Dark Matter. Many models that describe dark matter can generically introduce exotic Long-Lived Particles (LLPs). The proposed ANUBIS experiment is designed to search for these LLPs within the ATLAS detector cavern, located approximately 20-30 m from the Interaction Point (IP). A prototype detector, proANUBIS, has taken data within the ATLAS detector cavern since 2024, corresponding to 104 $fb^{-1}$ of pp data. We report on the potential sensitivity of ANUBIS to a selection of LLP models, i.e. Higgs Portal and Heavy Neutral Leptons, as well as future planned studies. Additionally, we will show the first results of the proANUBIS demonstrator, and how it will be used to study the expected backgrounds for the ANUBIS detector.</description>

      <title>High voltage and electrode system for a cryogenic experiment to search for the neutron electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cryogenic approach to the search for the neutron electric dipole moment--performing the experiment in superfluid liquid helium--holds promise for a substantial increase in sensitivity, potentially enabling a sensitivity level of $10^{-28}$ e-cm. A crucial component in realizing such an experiment is the high voltage and electrode system capable of providing an electric field of 75 kV/cm. This, in turn, requires an electric potential of 635 kV to be applied to the high voltage electrode, while simultaneously satisfying other experimental constraints, such as those on heat load and magnetic noise requirements. This paper describes the outcome of a comprehensive development program addressing these challenges. It outlines the system requirements, discusses new insights into relevant physical phenomena, and details selected technical solutions with their corresponding experimental demonstrations and expected performance. The results collectively demonstrate the successful development of the necessary technology for the high-voltage and electrode system for this approach.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.</description>

      <title>Studying the Strangeness $D$-Term in Hall C via Exclusive $\phi$ Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of exclusive electroproduction of $\phi$ mesons near threshold in Hall C. We will measure the |t|-dependence of the exclusive $\phi$ electroproduction cross section, which has recently been proposed as an observable sensitive to the strangeness $D$-term. The contribution of strangeness to the total $D$-term is presently unknown, with different arguments favoring $D_s$ being large, being small, or even having opposite sign from the total $D$-term. Our exploratory measurement is designed to distinguish between these hypotheses. If $D_s$ turns out to be small, $\phi$ electroproduction can be used to study the gluon $D$-term. In addition, this dataset will allow us to perform measurements of other exclusive meson final states, including the first measurement of $\eta'$ electroproduction and multi-differential measurements of $\eta$ and $\omega$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy of $DN$ and $\bar{D}N$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism. We employ an effective Lagrangian to model the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons and apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels, incorporating the effect of the Coulomb interaction when the pair involves two charged particles. The resulting full coupled-channel wave function is inserted into the Koonin-Pratt equation with channel weights derived from a thermal model. Additionally, we compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation with low-energy scattering parameters extracted from the unitarized amplitudes. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs. Our results can be tested against current and future experimental data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model and Optimization for Deep Space Radiation Shielding Based on Proton Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness &lt;=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p&lt;1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p&gt;1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.</description>
