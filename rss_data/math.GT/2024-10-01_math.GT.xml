      <title>Links in the spherical 3-manifold obtained from the quaternion group and their lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are infinitely many triples of non-isotopic hyperbolic links in the lens space $L(4,1)$ such that the three lifts of each triple in $S^{3}$ are isotopic. They are obtained as the lifts of links in $S^{3} / Q_{8}$ by double covers, where $Q_{8}$ is the quaternion group. To construct specific examples, we introduce a diagram of a link in $S^{3} / Q_{8}$ obtained by projecting to a square. The diagrams of isotopic links are connected by Reidemeister-type moves.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Internal and external stabilization of exotic surfaces in 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that many explicit examples of exotic pairs of surfaces in a smooth 4-manifold become smoothly isotopic after one external stabilization with $S^2\times S^2$ or $CP^2\#\overline{CP^2}$. Our results cover surfaces produced by rim-surgery, twist-rim-surgery, annulus rim-surgery, as well as infinite families of nullhomologus surfaces and examples with non-cyclic fundamental group of the complement. A special attention is given to the identification of the stabilizing manifold and its dependence on the choices in the construction of the surface. The main idea of this note is given by relating internal and external stabilization, and most of the results, but not all, are proved using this relation. Moreover, we show that the 2-links in the exotic family from the recent work of Bais, Benyahia, Malech and Torres are brunnian, under some additional assumptions about the construction.</description>

      <title>Totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links and electromagnetic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of real-analytic Legendrian links with respect to the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere $S^3$ corresponds both to the set of totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links as defined by Rudolph and to the set of stable knotted field lines in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. It is known that every isotopy class has a real-analytic Legendrian representative, so that every link type $L$ admits a holomorphic function $G:\mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}$ whose zeros intersect $S^3$ tangentially in $L$ and there is a Bateman electromagnetic field $\mathbf{F}$ with closed field lines in the shape of $L$. However, so far the family of torus links are the only examples where explicit expressions of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ have been found. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds for every given link type $L$ a real-analytic Legendrian representative, parametrised in terms of trigonometric polynomials. We then prove that (good candidates for) examples of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations, which is homogeneous in the case of $G$ and inhomogeneous in the case of $\mathbf{F}$. We also use the real-analytic Legendrian parametrisations to study the dynamics of knots in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. In particular, we show that no compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ can contain an electromagnetic knot indefinitely.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry and Topology of Positively Curved Eschenburg Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article explores the relationship between positive sectional curvature and the geometric and topological properties of Eschenburg $6$-orbifolds. First, we prove that positive sectional curvature imposes restrictions on the their singular sets, thereby confirming a conjecture posed by Florit and Ziller. Then we compute the orbifold cohomology rings for those with a specific singular locus. This reveals a distinctive behavior in the cohomology groups of positively curved Eschenburg orbifolds compared to their non-negatively curved counterparts. Furthermore, we compute the orbifold cohomology rings of all Eschenburg orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Latent Symmetry of Graphs and Stretch Factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>

      <title>Construction of holomorphic quilts in Cartesian product of closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we modify the proof of holomorphic quilts from Wehrheim and Woodward in \cite{wehrheim2009floer} to construct a specific type of immersed holomorphic quilt, where the symplectic manifolds are closed surfaces. The application is to compare Lagrangian Floer theory with quilted Lagrangian Floer theory, as they relate through Lagrangian correspondence. A potential example is provided to support Bottman and Wehrheim's conjecture \cite{bottman2018gromov} regarding the isomorphism between Lagrangian Floer homology and quilted Lagrangian Floer homology after twisting by bounding cochains.</description>

      <title>Singular value gap estimates for free products of semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish lower estimates for singular value gaps of free products of $1$-divergent semigroups $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2\subset \mathsf{GL}_d(\mathbb{K})$ which are in ping-pong position. As an application, we prove that if $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are quasi-isometrically embedded subgroups in ping pong position, then the group they generate $\langle \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2\rangle$ is also quasi-isometrically embedded. In addition, we establish that the class of linear finitely generated groups, admitting a faithful linear representation over $\mathbb{R}$ which is a quasi-isometric embedding, is closed under free products.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Lattices of Large Systole Containing a Fixed 3-Manifold Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a square free positive integer and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ a totally real quadratic field over $\mathbb{Q}$. We show there exists an arithmetic lattice L in $SL(8,\mathbb{R})$ with entries in the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ and a sequence of lattices $\Gamma_n $ commensurable to L such that the systole of the locally symmetric finite volume manifold $\Gamma_n \diagdown SL(8,\mathbb{R}) \diagup SO(8)$ goes to infinity as $n \rightarrow \infty$, yet every $\Gamma_n$ contains the same hyperbolic 3-manifold group $\Pi$, a finite index subgroup of the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold vol3. Notably, such an example does not exist in rank one, so this is a feature unique to higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Weighted homology theory of orbifolds and Weighted Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two new homology theories of orbifolds from some special type of triangulations adapted to orbifolds, called AW-homology and DW-homology. The main idea in the definitions of these two homology theories is that we use divisibly weighted simplices as building blocks of an orbifold and encode the orders of the local groups of the orbifold in the boundary maps of the chain complexes so that these two theories can reflect some information of the singular points. We prove that AW-homology and DW-homology are invariants of orbifolds under isomorphisms and more generally under certain type of homotopy equivalences of orbifolds. Moreover, we find that there exists a natural graded commutative product in the cohomology theory associated to DW-homology, which generalizes the cup product of the ordinary simplicial cohomology. In addition, we introduce a wider class of objects called weighted polyhedra and develop the whole theory of AW-homology and DW-homology in this wider setting. Our goal is to generalize the whole simplicial homology theory to all triangulizable topological spaces with a weight at each point where the weights are compatible with the triangulations in a certain sense.</description>

      <title>Semi-coarse Spaces, Homotopy and Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin the study the algebraic topology of semi-coarse spaces, which are generalizations of coarse spaces that enable one to endow non-trivial `coarse-like' structures to compact metric spaces, something which is impossible in coarse geometry. We first study homotopy in this context, and we then construct homology groups which are invariant under semi-coarse homotopy equivalence. We further show that any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ induces a semi-coarse structure on its set of vertices $V_G$, and that the respective semi-coarse homology is isomorphic to the Vietoris-Rips homology. This, in turn, leads to a homotopy invariance theorem for the Vietoris-Rips homology of undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>The Borel complexity of the space of left-orderings, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new tools to analyze the complexity of the conjugacy equivalence relation $E_\mathsf{lo}(G)$, whenever $G$ is a left-orderable group. Our methods are used to demonstrate non-smoothness of $E_\mathsf{lo}(G)$ for certain groups $G$ of dynamical origin, such as certain amalgams constructed from Thompson's group $F$. We also initiate a systematic analysis of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$, where $M$ is a $3$-manifold. We prove that if $M$ is not prime, then $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is a universal countable Borel equivalence relation, and show that in certain cases the complexity of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is bounded below by the complexity of the conjugacy equivalence relation arising from the fundamental group of each of the JSJ pieces of $M$. We also prove that if $M$ is the complement of a nontrivial knot in $S^3$ then $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is not smooth, and show how determining smoothness of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ for all knot manifolds $M$ is related to the L-space conjecture.</description>

      <title>Classification of aut-fixed subgroups in free-abelian times surface groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the direct product $G=\pi_1(\Sigma)\times \Z^k$ for $\Sigma$ a compact orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic, and give a complete classification of its fixed subgroups of automorphisms. As a corollary, we show that $G$ contains, up to isomorphism, infinitely many fixed subgroups of automorphisms if and only if $k\geq 2$, which is a contrast to that of hyperbolic groups. As an application on Nielsen fixed point theory, we provide a family of aspherical manifolds without Jiang's Bound Index Property. Moreover, we also give some results on the fixed subgroups of the direct product $H\times \Z^k$ for $H$ a non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic group.</description>
