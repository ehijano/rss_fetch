      <title>Sticky extinction states and the egalitarian transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abundance fluctuations caused by environmental stochasticity are proportional to population size. Therefore, populations that reach low density tend to remain in this state and can increase only due to rare sequences of favorable years. This stickiness can affect the composition of a community, as many species become trapped in an almost permanent state of rarity. Here, we present a solution for the species abundance distribution in scenarios where environmental stochasticity is the dominant mechanism. We show that in the absence of processes that impose a lower bound on abundances (such as immigration), the community is dominated, at equilibrium, by a single species. In the presence of immigration, the community undergoes a transition from an egalitarian state, under weak stochasticity, to a very skewed abundance distribution when stochasticity is strong.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics and long-range order in thermal neuristor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic devices, recent research has unveiled a novel category of spiking oscillators, termed "thermal neuristors." These devices function via thermal interactions among neighboring vanadium dioxide resistive memories, emulating biological neuronal behavior. Here, we show that the collective dynamical behavior of networks of these neurons showcases a rich phase structure, tunable by adjusting the thermal coupling and input voltage. Notably, we identify phases exhibiting long-range order that, however, does not arise from criticality, but rather from the time non-local response of the system. In addition, we show that these thermal neuristor arrays achieve high accuracy in image recognition and time series prediction through reservoir computing, without leveraging long-range order. Our findings highlight a crucial aspect of neuromorphic computing with possible implications on the functioning of the brain: criticality may not be necessary for the efficient performance of neuromorphic systems in certain computational tasks.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to high-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
