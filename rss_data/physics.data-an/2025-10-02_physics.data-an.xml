      <title>Predicting MacroB12: Data-Driven Assessment of Pre-PEG B12 Utility and Clinical Caveats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MacroB12 interference presents a significant challenge in the diagnosis of Vitamin B12 status, potentially masking true deficiency. To establish robust predictors and quantify the utility of pre-polyethylene glycol (PEG) B12 levels, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 875 individuals with hypercobalaminaemia (greater than 1000 pg/mL), using multiple imputation to handle missing data. Multivariable regression modelling revealed that MacroB12 positivity (less than 30% PEG recovery) was independently associated with a profile suggestive of autoimmunity, including older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.03 per year, P&lt;0.001) and a Rheumatologic/Autoimmune diagnosis (aOR 2.96, P=0.01). We also identified a counterintuitive haematological signature, with higher haemoglobin (aOR 1.14, P=0.02) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (aOR 1.04, P=0.01) predicting MacroB12. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of pre-PEG B12 concentration yielded only moderate discriminatory power (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.744, 95% CI 0.707-0.782). The optimal threshold of 1584.0 pg/mL (sensitivity 71.3%, specificity 69.7%) serves to stratify clinical suspicion, but its performance confirms that it cannot replace definitive confirmatory testing. Our findings define a clinical and laboratory phenotype for suspected MacroB12 but highlight that confirmatory PEG precipitation remains essential for accurate diagnosis, particularly in older patients and those with autoimmune disease.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spacings in the superposed spectra of random matrices with comparison to spacing ratios and application to complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between random matrices and the spectral fluctuations of complex quantum systems in a suitable limit can be explained by using the setup of random matrix theory. Higher-order spacing statistics in the $m$ superposed spectra of circular random matrices are studied numerically. We tabulated the modified Dyson index $\beta'$ for a given $m$, $k$, and $\beta$, for which the nearest neighbor spacing distribution is the same as that of the $k$-th order spacing distribution corresponding to the $\beta$ and $m$. Here, we conjecture that for given $m(k)$ and $\beta$, the obtained sequence of $\beta'$ as a function of $k(m)$ is unique. This result can be used as a tool for the characterization of the system and to determine the symmetry structure of the system without desymmetrization of the spectra. We verify the results of the $m=2$ case of COE with the quantum kicked top model corresponding to various Hilbert space dimensions. From the comparative study of the higher-order spacings and ratios in both $m=1$ and $m=2$ cases of COE and GOE by varying dimension, keeping the number of realizations constant and vice-versa, we find that both COE and GOE have the same asymptotic behavior in terms of a given higher-order statistics. But, we found from our numerical study that within a given ensemble of COE or GOE, the results of spacings and ratios agree with each other only up to some lower $k$, and beyond that, they start deviating from each other. It is observed that for the $k=1$ case, the convergence towards the Poisson distribution is faster in the case of ratios than the corresponding spacings as we increase $m$ for a given $\beta$. Further, the spectral fluctuations of the intermediate map of various dimensions are studied. There, we find that the effect of random numbers used to generate the matrix corresponding to the map is reflected in the higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Architecturally Constrained Solutions to Ill-Conditioned Problems in QUBIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new physics-guided Machine Learning framework, with which we solve the generally non-invertible, ill-conditioned problems through an analytical approach and constrain the solution to the approximate inverse with the architecture of Neural Networks. By informing the networks of the underlying physical processes, the method optimizes data usage and enables interpretability of the model while simultaneously allowing estimation of detector properties and the propagation of their corresponding uncertainties. The method is applied in reconstructing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps observed with the novel interferometric QUBIC experiment aimed at measuring the tensor-to-scalar ratio r.</description>

      <title>Extracting self-similarity from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying self-similarity is key to understanding and modelling a plethora of phenomena in fluid mechanics. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex flows. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in five problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, a collapsing cavity, and decaying turbulence. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind tunnel experiments. The algorithm recovers the known self-similarity expressions in the first four problems and generates new insights on single length scale theories of homogeneous turbulence.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Mutual Information in High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence between two variables, yet accurate estimation from finite data remains notoriously difficult. No estimator is universally reliable, and common approaches fail in the high-dimensional, undersampled regimes typical of modern experiments. Recent machine learning-based estimators show promise, but their accuracy depends sensitively on dataset size, structure, and hyperparameters, with no accepted tests to detect failures. We close these gaps through a systematic evaluation of classical and neural MI estimators across standard benchmarks and new synthetic datasets tailored to challenging high-dimensional, undersampled regimes. We contribute: (i) a practical protocol for reliable MI estimation with explicit checks for statistical consistency; (ii) confidence intervals (error bars around estimates) that existing neural MI estimator do not provide; and (iii) a new class of probabilistic critics designed for high-dimensional, high-information settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol with computational experiments, showing that it consistently matches or surpasses existing methods while uniquely quantifying its own reliability. We show that reliable MI estimation is sometimes achievable even in severely undersampled, high-dimensional datasets, provided they admit accurate low-dimensional representations. This broadens the scope of applicability of neural MI estimators and clarifies when such estimators can be trusted.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>
