      <title>Stabilization of sawteeth instability by short gas pulse injection in ADITYA-U tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on ADITYA-U tokamak show a marked enhancement in the sawtooth period by application of short gas puffs of fuel that cause a modification of the radial density profile. A consequent suppression of the trapped electron modes (TEMs) then leads to an increase in the core electron temperature. This slows down the heat propagation following a sawtooth crash, causing a delay in achieving the critical temperature gradient inside the q = 1 surface required for the next sawtooth crash to happen. The overall scenario has strong similarities with the behavior of sawtooth under electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). Our findings suggest an alternate, simpler technique for sawtooth control that may be usefully employed in small/medium-sized tokamaks that do not have an ECRH or any other auxiliary heating facility.</description>

      <title>High order interpolation of magnetic fields with vector potential reconstruction for particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for interpolating divergence-free continuous magnetic fields via vector potential reconstruction using Hermite interpolation, which ensures high-order continuity for applications requiring adaptive, high-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) integrators, such as the Dormand-Prince method. The method provides C(m) continuity and achieves high-order accuracy, making it particularly suited for particle trajectory integration and Poincar\'e section analysis under optimal integration order and timestep adjustments. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the Hermite interpolation method preserves volume and continuity, which are critical for conserving toroidal canonical momentum and magnetic moment in guiding center simulations, especially over long-term trajectory integration. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of insufficient derivative continuity on Runge-Kutta schemes and show how it degrades accuracy at low error tolerances, introducing discontinuity-induced truncation errors. Finally, we demonstrate performant Poincar\'e section analysis in two relevant settings of field data collocated from finite element meshes</description>

      <title>Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \gg k_{\rm nl}$, where $k_{\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function -- its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space -- underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov--Poisson simulations, which confirm it.</description>

      <title>Dual formulation of the maximum entropy method applied to analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fields of physics use quantum Monte Carlo techniques, but struggle to estimate dynamic spectra via the analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error. The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, "Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method" Data 5.3 (2020)]. We present new theoretical issues that are not yet in the literature. Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Turbulent magnetic decay controlled by two conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of a turbulent magnetic field is slower with helicity than without. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation length grows faster for a helical than a nonhelical field. Both helical and nonhelical decay laws involve conserved quantities: the mean magnetic helicity density and the Hosking integral. Using direct numerical simulations in a triply periodic domain, we show quantitatively that in the fractionally helical case the mean magnetic energy density and correlation length are approximately given by the maximum of the values for the purely helical and purely nonhelical cases. The time of switch-over from one to the other decay law can be obtained on dimensional grounds and is approximately given by $I_\mathrm{H}^{1/2}I_\mathrm{M}^{-3/2}$, where $I_\mathrm{H}$ is the Hosking integral and $I_\mathrm{M}$ is the mean magnetic helicity density. An earlier approach based on the decay time is found to agree with our new result and suggests that the Hosking integral exceeds naive estimates by the square of the same resistivity-dependent factor by which also the turbulent decay time exceeds the Alfv\'en time. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, the mean magnetic helicity density is known to be not conserved, and we show that then also the Hosking integral is not conserved.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tungsten influx rate using line emissions from W$^{5+}$ ions in EAST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The S/XB ratios (ionization per emitted photon) allow one to relate spectroscopic emissivity measurements to the impurity influx from a localized source. In this work, we determine the tungsten influx by examining two dominant EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) line emissions at 382.13 \AA and 394.07 \AA, corresponding to the $4f 14 5f \rightarrow 4f 14 5d$ radiative transitions of the W$^{5+}$ ion. The ground configuration of W$^{5+}$ consists of the ground level and a metastable level, with the latter having a higher population than the ground state. Therefore, a simple approach assuming that the transitions are independent, i.e., only populated by a unique level source, requires correction. To address this, we have developed a fully collisional-radiative modeling in which 430 levels contribute to the ionization. We have utilized three advanced computational codes -- HULLAC (Hebrew University - Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code), AS (AutoStructure), and FAC (Flexible Atomic Code) -- for the atomic structure calculations. These codes provide the necessary information such as wavelengths, collisional and radiative transition rate coefficients. The FAC code was also used to calculate the direct electron-impact ionization under the distorted-wave approximation. We also included contributions to total ionization from excitation-autoionization processes up to $n = 15$ manifolds from the distorted-wave calculations. Subsequently, we used these results to ascertain the tungsten impurity influx in a dedicated discharge of the EAST tokamak, which operates with full tungsten divertors. In our findings, we observed that for the density range relevant to the edge region of a tokamak reactor, the S/XB ratios are almost independent of electron density but exhibit significant variation with electron temperature.</description>
