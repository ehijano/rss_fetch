      <title>Automation, AI, and the Intergenerational Transmission of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have fueled predictions of unprecedented productivity growth. Yet, by enabling senior workers to perform more tasks on their own, AI may inadvertently reduce entry-level opportunities, raising concerns about how future generations will acquire essential skills. In this paper, I develop a model to examine how advanced automation affects the intergenerational transmission of knowledge. The analysis reveals that automating entry-level tasks yields immediate productivity gains but can undermine long-run growth by eroding the skills of subsequent generations. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that AI-driven entry-level automation could reduce U.S. long-term annual growth by approximately 0.05 to 0.35 percentage points, depending on its scale. I also demonstrate that AI co-pilots - systems that democratize access to expertise previously acquired only through hands-on experience - can partially mitigate these negative effects. However, their introduction is not always beneficial: by providing expert insights, co-pilots may inadvertently diminish younger workers' incentives to invest in hands-on learning. These findings cast doubt on the optimistic view that AI will automatically lead to sustained productivity growth, unless it either generates new entry-level roles or significantly boosts the economy's underlying innovation rate.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Unmeasurable? Systematic Evidence on Scale Transformations in Subjective Survey Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economists routinely use survey measures of, for example, risk preferences, trust, political attitudes, or wellbeing. The literature generally treats numerical response categories as if they represent equal psychological intervals. We provide the first systematic test of this assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily results can be overturned when this linearity assumption is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents interpret survey scales in ways that do deviate from linearity, but only mildly. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 30,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Replicated coefficient signs are remarkably robust to mild departures from linear scale-use. However, statistical inference and estimates of relative effect magnitudes become unreliable, even under modest departures from linearity. This is especially problematic for policy applications. We show that these concerns generalise to many other widely used survey-based constructs.</description>

      <title>Automating Capacitor Part Selection with Dual-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for optimizing capacitor selection in electronic design using multi-objective linear and non-linear constrained optimization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in minimizing cost and board area while meeting critical performance requirements.</description>
