      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with a Joint-Likelihood Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find $N_{\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\,2.94 _{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.</description>

      <title>Confronting Cold New Early Dark Energy and its Equation of State with Updated CMB and Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold New Early Dark Energy (Cold NEDE) addresses the Hubble tension through a triggered vacuum phase transition in the dark sector. In this paper, we constrain a phenomenological fluid model using recent cosmic microwave background likelihoods based on Planck NPIPE data alongside baryonic acoustic oscillations and supernovae data from Pantheon+. Exploiting the enhanced constraining power of the datasets, we introduce and study an extended version of the NEDE fluid model in which the equation of state parameter $w_\mathrm{NEDE}$, characterizing the post-phase transition fluid, is allowed to evolve with non-vanishing derivatives ${d}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/d\ln a$ and ${d^2}w_\mathrm{NEDE}/{d}(\ln a)^2$. Our results indicate that data is compatible with a rather simple time dependence that could arise from a mixture of radiation and a stiff fluid. With the updated datasets, the base and extended models still show a significant reduction of the DMAP tension from $6.3 \sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM down to $3.5\sigma$ with a small simultaneous reduction of the $S_8$ tension, slightly improving over recent findings for the axion-like early dark energy model.</description>

      <title>LINX: A Fast, Differentiable, and Extensible Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LINX (Light Isotope Nucleosynthesis with JAX), a new differentiable public Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) code designed for fast parameter estimation. By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and differentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including gradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid primordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be used. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without requiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.</description>

      <title>The Impact from Galaxy Groups on Cosmological Measurements with Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the low-redshift end ($z&lt;0.05$) of the Hubble diagram with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), the contribution to Hubble residual scatter from peculiar velocities is of similar size to that due to the standardization of the SN Ia light curve. A way to improve the redshift measurement of the SN host galaxy is to utilize the average redshift of the galaxy group, effectively averaging over small-scale/intracluster peculiar velocities. One limiting factor is the fraction of SN host galaxies in galaxy groups, previously found to be 30% using (relatively incomplete) magnitude-limited galaxy catalogs. Here, we do the first analysis of N-body simulations to predict this fraction, finding $\sim$66% should have associated groups and group averaging should improve redshift precision by $\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, using spectroscopic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present results from the first pilot program to evaluate whether or not 23 previously unassociated SN Ia hosts belong in groups. We find that 91% of these candidates can be associated with groups, consistent with predictions from simulations given the sample size. Combining with previously assigned SN host galaxies in Pantheon+, we demonstrate improvement in Hubble residual scatter equivalent to 145 km s$^{-1}$, also consistent with simulations. For new and upcoming low-$z$ samples from, for example, the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a separate follow-up program identifying galaxy groups of SN hosts is a highly cost-effective way to enhance their constraining power.</description>

      <title>Investigating Late-Time Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI Y1 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae (SN) luminosity distances, suggests a dynamical evolution of the dark energy equation of state with a phantom phase ($w &lt; -1$) in the past when the so-called $w_0w_a$ parametrization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ is assumed. In this work, we investigate more general dark energy models that also allow a phantom equation of state. We consider three cases: an equation of state with a transition feature, a model-agnostic equation of state with constant values in chosen redshift bins, and a k-essence model. Since the dark energy equation of state is correlated with neutrino masses, we reassess constraints on the neutrino mass sum focusing on the model-agnostic equation of state. We find that the combination of DESI BAO with Planck 2018 CMB data and SN data from Pantheon, Pantheon+, or Union3 is consistent with an oscillatory dark energy equation of state, while a monotonic behavior is preferred by the DESY5 SN data. Performing model comparison techniques, we find that the $w_0w_a$ parametrization remains the simplest dark energy model that can provide a better fit to DESI BAO, CMB, and all SN datasets than $\Lambda$CDM. Constraints on the neutrino mass sum assuming dynamical dark energy are relaxed compared to $\Lambda$CDM and we show that these constraints are tighter in the model-agnostic case relative to $w_0w_a$ model by $70\%-90\%$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Redshift-Binned Dark Energy using DESI BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parameterize the equation of state of late-time dark energy as $w_{\mathrm{bin}}(z)$, with three redshift bins, characterized by a constant equation of state in each bin. Then, we constrain the parameters of the $w_{\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model using datasets from DESI BAO data, Planck CMB power spectrum, ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum, and type Ia supernova distance-redshift data of Pantheon Plus/DES Y5/Union3. The significances for $w_1&gt;-1$ is $1.9\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$, and $w_2$ is consistent with $-1$ within $1\sigma$ level, while $1.6\sigma$, $1.5\sigma$ and $1.5\sigma$ for $w_3&lt;-1$ in these three data combinations with different choices of type Ia supernova datasets, respectively. Additionally, to alleviate $H_0$ tension, we incorporate the early dark energy (EDE) model in the early-time universe and add the SH0ES absolute magnitude $M_b$ prior (or $H_0$ prior) to further constrain the $w_{\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model. In the $w_{\mathrm{bin}}$EDE model, we find a $w_{\mathrm{bin}}(z)$ pattern similar to that in the $w_{\mathrm{bin}}$CDM model. The results of the three data combinations exhibit $w_1&gt;-1$ at $1.9\sigma$, $1.7\sigma$ and $2.9\sigma$ level, meanwhile $w_3&lt;-1$ at $1.3\sigma$, $1.3\sigma$ and $1.3\sigma$ level, respectively. In all, our results indicate that the transition of dark energy from phantom at high redshifts to quintessence at low redshifts is not conclusive.</description>

      <title>MEET-U project II: Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern-Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern-Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due the Chern-Simons term in the metric formulation.</description>

      <title>Halo mass functions at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at $z \geq 10$, has led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard ${\Lambda}$CMD models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodyanmics code SWIFT to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and halo mass function fits is less than a factor of two within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the angle of deflection of light by the gravitational field inside and outside a spherical body with a homogeneous mass density. We show that the largest deflections, which can be measured by weak gravitational lensing, are in a region displaced from the center of mass. This result can be extended to more general distributions of matter. This displacement, observed in galaxies and colliding galaxy clusters, may be therefore explained without dark matter, within general relativity.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics in Interacting Scalar-Torsion f(T,$\phi$) Gravity: Investigating Energy and Momentum Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Analysing Hubble Tension and Gravitational Waves for $f(Q,T)$ Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine viable models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories against observational data with the aim to constrain the parameter space of these models. We have analysed five different models of $f(Q,T)$ gravity and tested them against Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometer data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data and Pantheon data. We put stringent constraints on the $f(Q,T)$ gravity models, $f(Q,T) = Q^{n} +\beta T$ $(n=1,2,3)$, $f(Q,T)=-\alpha Q-\beta T^{2}$ and $f(Q,T)=Q^{-2}T^{2}$ along with other cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation of state parameter and demonstrate their alignment with the $\Lambda CDM$ model and the observational data. We show that these models have the capability to alleviate the Hubble tension, by predicting the present value of the Hubble parameter close to $74$km/s/Mpc. $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory introduces alterations in the background evolution and imposes a friction term in the propagation of gravitational waves, this phenomenon has also been examined. We have shown their agreement with the Gravitational Wave (GW) luminosity distance with the Electromagnetic (EM) counter part data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced VIRGO across different observing runs capturing coalescence of Binary Neutron Stars (BNS), mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBHs), and Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) binaries with EM counterparts.</description>

      <title>Combining underground and on-surface third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, detailed studies have been made to compare the performance of the European next generation GW observatory Einstein Telescope (ET) in a single-site triangular configuration with the performance of a configuration featuring two L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics except for the geometry, in particular, underground and composed of a low-frequency interferometer working at cryogenic temperatures and a high-frequency interferometer working at room temperature. Here we study a further possibility for a European network, made by a single L-shaped underground detector, like one of the detectors considered for the 2L version of ET, and a single third-generation 20-km L-shaped interferometer on the surface. We compare the performances of such a network to those of the triangle and of the 2L-underground ET configurations. We then examine the performance of an intercontinental network made by a 40-km CE in the US, together with any of these European networks.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into the NGC 741 Galaxy Group: Insights into a Spectacular Head-Tail Radio Galaxy from VLA, MeerKAT, uGMRT and LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz$-$8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long ($\sim$ 255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and eastern lobe-like structure, and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ($\mathcal{M}\sim2$) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM) while the ring may have been formed by interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and re-accelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected $\sim$2-5$\times$10$^{57}$ erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multi-frequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.</description>

      <title>MADNESS Deblender: Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the unprecedented depth of the upcoming ground-based Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, approximately two-thirds of the galaxies are likely to be affected by blending - the overlap of physically separated galaxies in images. Thus, extracting reliable shapes and photometry from individual objects will be limited by our ability to correct blending and control any residual systematic effect. Deblending algorithms tackle this issue by reconstructing the isolated components from a blended scene, but the most commonly used algorithms often fail to model complex realistic galaxy morphologies.
  As part of an effort to address this major challenge, we present MADNESS, which takes a data-driven approach and combines pixel-level multi-band information to learn complex priors for obtaining the maximum a posteriori solution of deblending. MADNESS is based on deep neural network architectures such as variational auto-encoders and normalizing flows. The variational auto-encoder reduces the high-dimensional pixel space into a lower-dimensional space, while the normalizing flow models a data-driven prior in this latent space.
  Using a simulated test dataset with galaxy models for a 10-year LSST survey and a galaxy density ranging from 48 to 80 galaxies per arcmin2 we characterize the aperture-photometry g-r color, structural similarity index, and pixel cosine similarity of the galaxies reconstructed by MADNESS. We compare our results against state-of-the-art deblenders including scarlet. With the r-band of LSST as an example, we show that MADNESS performs better than in all the metrics. For instance, the average absolute value of relative flux residual in the r-band for MADNESS is approximately 29% lower than that of scarlet. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coexistence Test of Primordial Black Holes and Particle Dark Matter from Diffractive Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effects of baryon physics on small-scale redshift space distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redshift space distortions are an important probe of the growth of large-scale structure and for constraining cosmological parameters in general. As galaxy redshift surveys approach percent level precision in their observations of the two point clustering statistics, it is timely to review what effects baryons and associated processes such as feedback may have on small-scale clustering in redshift space. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we show using the large-volume BAHAMAS hydrodynamic simulations that the effect of baryons can be as much as 1% in the k ~ 0.1 h/Mpc range for the monopole and 5% for quadrupole, and that this could rise to as much as 10% at k~10 h/Mpc in both measurements. For the halo power spectra, this difference can be as much 3-4% in the monopole on scales of 0.05 &lt; k &lt; 0.3 h/Mpc for 10^{13} M_sun/h haloes. We find that these deviations can be mitigated to the sub-percent level in the both the monopole and quadrupole up to k ~ 0.3 h/Mpc if the baryon corrected halo masses are used to calculate the redshift space power spectra. Finally, we use the cosmo-OWLS simulation suite to explore the changes in the redshift space power spectra with different feedback prescriptions, finding that there is a maximum of 15-20% difference between the redshift space monopole and quadrupole with and without baryons at k ~1-2 h/Mpc within these models.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Cosmological Constant using Galactic Rotation Curves from the SPARC Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark energy (and its simplest model, the Cosmological Constant or $\Lambda$) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper limit on $\Lambda$ studies its pushback to the attractive gravitational force of dark matter. From the SPARC dataset, we select galaxies that are best fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist density models. Introducing the presence of $\Lambda$ in these galaxies helps to establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper limit on $\Lambda$ is around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. {We show that for galaxies with detectable velocities far from the galaxy core, the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Furthermore, we show that galaxies and other systems follow the same principle: for larger orbital periods the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Consequently, we address the implications for future measurements on the upper limit and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>The prototypical major cluster merger Abell 754. I. Calibration of MeerKAT data and radio/X-ray spectral mapping of the cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abell 754 is a rich galaxy cluster at $z=0.0543$ and is considered the prototype of a major cluster merger. Like many dynamically unrelaxed systems, it hosts diffuse radio emission on Mpc-scales. Extended synchrotron sources in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are commonly interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the gravitational energy released during cluster mergers is dissipated into nonthermal components. Here, we use new MeerKAT UHF- and L-band observations to study nonthermal phenomena in Abell 754. These data are complemented with archival XMM-Newton observations to investigate the resolved spectral properties of both the radio and X-ray cluster emission.For the first time, we employed the pipeline originally developed to calibrate LOFAR data to MeerKAT observations. This allowed us to perform a direction-dependent calibration and obtain highly sensitive radio images in UHF- and L-bands which capture the extended emission with unprecedented detail. By using a large XMM-Newton mosaic, we produced thermodynamic maps of the ICM. Our analysis reveals that the radio halo in the cluster center is bounded by the well-known shock in the eastern direction. Furthermore, in the southwest periphery, we discover an extended radio source that we classify as a radio relic which is possibly tracing a shock driven by the squeezed gas compressed by the merger, outflowing in perpendicular directions. The low-luminosity of this relic appears compatible with direct acceleration of thermal pool electrons. We interpret the observed radio and X-ray features in the context of a major cluster merger with a nonzero impact parameter. Abell 754 is a remarkable galaxy cluster showcasing exceptional features associated with the ongoing merger event. The high quality of the new MeerKAT data motivates further work on this system.</description>

      <title>Impact of Large-Scale Structure Formation on the Global Information Budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers an original theoretical framework to quantify the information content associated with cosmological structure formation. By taking into account the growth in perturbations for the matter density field, we are able to calculate the relative reduction in the information entropy from the projection for a fully homogeneous setting. An analytical study is carried out to track back the evolution of global information content up to $z=20$, where a log-normal density distribution with redshift-dependent variance, skewness, and kurtosis is used to mimic the observable Universe. We report a $0.004\%$ drop in the information entropy of the Universe, that is caused by the formation of large-scale structures in the present universe. The accelerated expansion of the Universe is suspected as a countermeasure by nature to override the exponential growth in this entropic drop. We also analyse how the scale factor, expansion rate and growth rate of structure formation are connected with the entropic drop, taking the $\Lambda CDM$ model into account. The formalism is further developed and employed to study the spectrum of information underlying the galaxy distribution in the observable Universe. Using data from SDSS DR18 we also quantify the information sharing across different parts of the studied volume. An attempt to validate the assumption of cosmic homogeneity is made, which rules out the presence of a Universal scale of uniformity below 130 $h^{-1}$ Mpc.</description>

Abstract: The single field Ekpyrosis of Khoury and Steinhardt \cite{khoury}-\cite{khoury1} admits a Jordan frame scalar field with a double well potential. After the end of the ekpyrotic phase, as energy density increases we find a phase transition scenario to a symmetric phase at the conformal coupling fixed point leads to a non-singular bounce in Einstein frame. This scenario could admit a simple prescription for the small value of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

Abstract: Hot viscous plasmas unavoidably emit a gravitational wave background, similar to electromagnetic black body radiation. We study the contribution from hidden particles to the diffuse background emitted by the primordial plasma in the early universe. While this contribution can easily dominate over that from Standard Model particles, we find that both are capped by a generic upper bound that makes them difficult to detect with interferometers in the foreseeable future. We illustrate our results for axions and heavy neutral leptons. Finally, our results suggest that previous works overestimated the gravitational wave background from particle decays out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for spectator scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. Although our calculation is done for spectator fields, if applied to curvature perturbations during inflation our observations here could close a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities in Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the earlier linear studies of cosmological peculiar velocities to Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature. In the process, we also compare our results with those obtained in cosmologies with Euclidean spatial sections. Employing relativistic cosmological perturbation theory, we first provide the differential formulae governing the evolution of peculiar velocities on all Friedmann backgrounds. The technical complexities of the curved models, however, mean that analytic solutions are possible only in special, though characteristic, moments in the lifetime of these universes. Nevertheless, our solutions exhibit persistent patterns that make us confident enough to generalise them. Thus, we confirm earlier claims that, compared to the Newtonian studies, the relativistic analysis supports considerably stronger linear growth-rates for peculiar-velocity perturbations. This result holds irrespective of the background curvature. Moreover, for positive curvature, the peculiar growth-rate is found to be faster than that obtained in a spatially flat Friedman universe. In contrast, linear peculiar velocities appear to grow at a slower pace when their Friedmann host is spatially open. Extrapolating them to the present, our results seem to suggest faster bulk peculiar motions in overdense, rather than in underdense, regions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence from Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) birefringence is a remarkable phenomenon that can be used to test the parity violation in gravity. By coupling the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term, we explore the GW birefringence effects in the FDM background. In particular, in light of the highly oscillating granular FDM structure at the galactic scale, we are led to investigating the GW propagation in the Chern-Simons gravity over the general nontrivial scalar profile, which is a natural extension of previous studies on the homogeneous and isotropic configurations. As a result, it is found that GWs of both circularly polarized modes propagate in the straight line with the speed of light, and does not show any velocity birefringence. However, when considering the imaginary part of the dispersion relation, GWs exhibit the amplitude birefringence in which one circular polarization is enhanced while the other suppressed. Due to its local nature, the FDM-induced amplitude birefringence only depends on the GW frequency without any reliance on the GW event distance. More importantly, the birefringence factor shows a periodic time variation with the period reflecting the FDM scalar mass, which is the smoking gun for testing this new birefringence mechanism. Finally, we also study the extra-galactic FDM contribution to the GW birefringence, which is shown to be suppressed by the cosmological DM density and thus subdominant compared with the galactic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>

Abstract: We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>
