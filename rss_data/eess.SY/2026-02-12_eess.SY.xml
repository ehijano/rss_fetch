      <title>Efficient Policy Adaptation for Voltage Control Under Unknown Topology Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for designing voltage control policies, but their performance often degrades under changing system conditions such as topology reconfigurations and load variations. We introduce a topology-aware online policy optimization framework that leverages data-driven estimation of voltage-reactive power sensitivities to achieve efficient policy adaptation. Exploiting the sparsity of topology-switching events, where only a few lines change at a time, our method efficiently detects topology changes and identifies the affected lines and parameters, enabling fast and accurate sensitivity updates without recomputing the full sensitivity matrix. The estimated sensitivity is subsequently used for online policy optimization of a pre-trained neural-network-based RL controller. Simulations on both the IEEE 13-bus and SCE 56-bus systems demonstrate over 90 percent line identification accuracy, using only 15 data points. The proposed method also significantly improves voltage regulation performance compared with non-adaptive policies and adaptive policies that rely on regression-based online optimization methods for sensitivity estimation.</description>

      <title>Resilient Voltage Estimation for Battery Packs Using Self-Learning Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based battery management systems (BMSs) rely on real-time voltage measurement data to ensure coordinated bi-directional charging of electric vehicles (EVs) with vehicle-to-grid technology. Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the measurement data during transmission from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS, leading to disrupted EV charging. Therefore, to ensure reliable voltage data under such sensor attacks, this paper proposes a two-stage error-corrected self-learning Koopman operator-based secure voltage estimation scheme for large-format battery packs. The first stage of correction compensates for the Koopman approximation error. The second stage aims to recover the error amassing from the lack of higher-order battery dynamics information in the self-learning feedback, using two alternative methods: an adaptable empirical strategy that uses cell-level knowledge of open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for pack-level estimation, and a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method that leverages minimal data-training. During our comprehensive case studies using the high-fidelity battery simulation package 'PyBaMM-liionpack', our proposed secure estimator reliably generated real-time voltage estimation with high accuracy under varying pack topologies, charging settings, battery age-levels, and attack policies. Thus, the scalable and adaptable algorithm can be easily employed to diverse battery configurations and operating conditions, without requiring significant modifications, excessive data or sensor redundancy, to ensure optimum charging of EVs under compromised sensing.</description>

      <title>Scale-Free delta-Level Coherent Output Synchronization of Multi-Agent Systems with Adaptive Protocols and Bounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scale-free delta-level coherent output synchronization for multi-agent systems (MAS) operating under bounded disturbances or noises. We introduce an adaptive scale-free framework designed solely based on the knowledge of agent models and completely agnostic to both the communication topology and the size of the network. We define the level of coherency for each agent as the norm of the weighted sum of the disagreement dynamics with its neighbors. We define each agents coherency level as the norm of a weighted sum of its disagreement dynamics relative to its neighbors. The goal is to ensure that the networks coherency level remains below a prescribed threshold delta, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the disturbance.</description>

      <title>Rapid Boundary Stabilization of Two-Dimensional Elastic Plates with In-Domain Aeroelastic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by active wing flutter suppression in high-Mach-number flight, this paper presents a rapid boundary stabilization strategy for a two-dimensional PDE-modeled elastic plate with in-domain instabilities, where the exponential stability is achieved with a decay rate that can be arbitrarily assigned by the users. First, the aeroelastic system is modeled as two-dimensional coupled wave PDEs with internal anti-damping terms, derived by Piston theory and Hamilton's principle. Using Fourier series expansion, the 2-D problem is decomposed into a parameterized family of 1-D systems. For each mode, a full-state boundary feedback controller is designed via PDE backstepping transformation. To enable output-feedback implementation, a state observer is further designed to estimate the distributed states over the two-dimensional spatial domain. Through Lyapunov analysis, the exponential stability of the 2-D elastic plate PDE under the proposed boundary control is established with a designer-tunable decay rate. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the control strategy in suppressing flow-induced vibrations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Active Damping with Shaping-Filtered Reset Tracking Control for Piezo-Actuated Nanopositioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric nanopositioning systems are often limited by lightly damped structural resonances and the gain--phase constraints of linear feedback, which restrict achievable bandwidth and tracking performance. This paper presents a dual-loop architecture that combines an inner-loop non-minimum-phase resonant controller (NRC) for active damping with an outer-loop tracking controller augmented by a constant-gain, lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset element to provide phase lead at the targeted crossover without increasing loop gain. We show that aggressively tuned CgLp designs with larger phase lead can introduce pronounced higher-order harmonics, degrading error sensitivity in specific frequency bands and causing multiple-reset behavior. To address this, a shaping filter is introduced in the reset-trigger path to regulate the reset action and suppress harmonic-induced effects while preserving the desired crossover-phase recovery. The proposed controllers are implemented in real time on an industrial piezo nanopositioner, demonstrating an experimental open-loop crossover increase of approximately 55~Hz and a closed-loop bandwidth improvement of about 34~Hz relative to a well-tuned linear baseline.</description>

      <title>Improving CACC Robustness to Parametric Uncertainty via Plant Equivalent Controller Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) enables vehicle platooning through inter-vehicle communication, improving traffic efficiency and safety. Conventional CACC relies on feedback linearization, assuming exact vehicle parameters; however, longitudinal vehicle dynamics are nonlinear and subject to parametric uncertainty. Applying feedback linearization with a nominal model yields imperfect cancellation, leading to model mismatch and degraded performance with off-the-shelf CACC controllers. To improve robustness without redesigning the CACC law, we explicitly model the mismatch between the ideal closed-loop dynamics assumed by the CACC design and the actual dynamics under parametric uncertainties. Robustness is formulated as an $\mathcal{L}_2$ trajectory-matching problem, minimizing the energy of this mismatch to make the uncertain system behave as closely as possible to the ideal model. This objective is addressed by optimizing over plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations that preserve the nominal closed-loop behavior while mitigating the effects of parametric uncertainty. Stability and performance are enforced via linear matrix inequalities, yielding a convex optimization problem applicable to heterogeneous platoons. Experimental results demonstrate improved robustness and performance under parametric uncertainty while preserving nominal CACC behavior.</description>

      <title>Reference Output Tracking in Boolean Control Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of tracking a given reference output trajectory is investigated for the class of Boolean control networks, by resorting to their algebraic representation. First, the case of a finite-length reference trajectory is addressed, and the analysis and algorithm first proposed in [17] are extended to be able to deal with arbitrary initial conditions and to identify all possible solutions. The approach developed for the finite-length case is then adjusted to cope with periodic reference output trajectories. The results of the paper are illustrated through an example.</description>

      <title>Singular Port-Hamiltonian Systems Beyond Passivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of port-Hamiltonian systems whose vector fields exhibit singularities. A representative example of this class has recently been employed in the power electronics literature to implement a grid-forming controller. We show that, under certain conditions, these port-Hamiltonian systems, when interconnected with passive systems, converge to a prescribed non-equilibrium steady state. At first glance, the apparently passive nature of the port-Hamiltonian system seems incompatible with the active power injection required to sustain this non-equilibrium condition. However, we demonstrate that the discontinuity inherent in the vector field provides the additional energy needed to maintain this operating point, indicating that the system is not globally passive. Moreover, when the discontinuity is replaced by a continuous approximation, the resulting system becomes cyclo-dissipative while still capable of supplying the required power.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control of PDEs on Domains with Graph-Monotone Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive body of work on backstepping for one-dimensional PDEs, results in higher dimensions remain comparatively limited. Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply several machine learning algorithms to the problem of anomaly detection in operational data for large-scale, high-voltage electric power grids. We observe important differences in the performance of the algorithms. Neural networks typically outperform classical algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, which we explain by the strong contextual nature of the anomalies. We show that unsupervised learning algorithm work remarkably well and that their predictions are robust against simultaneous, concurring anomalies.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-based data-driven predictive control and the state-space predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define trajectory predictive control (TPC) as a family of output-feedback indirect data-driven predictive control (DDPC) methods that represent the output trajectory of a discrete-time system as a linear function of the recent input/output history and the planned input trajectory. This paper shows that for different choices of the trajectory predictor, TPC encompasses a wide variety of DDPC methods, including subspace predictive control (SPC), closed-loop SPC, $\gamma$-DDPC, causal-$\gamma$-DDPC, transient predictive control, and others. This paper introduces a trajectory predictor that corresponds to a linear state-space model with the recent input/output history as the state. With this state-space predictor, TPC is a special case of linear model predictive control and therefore inherits its mature theory. In numerical experiments, TPC performance approaches the limit of oracle $H_2$-optimal control with perfect knowledge of the underlying system model. For TPC with small training datasets, the state-space predictor outperforms other predictors because it has fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Variational Integrator for the Geometrically Exact Rod with Circular Cross-Section Incorporating Cross-Sectional Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the continuous space-time equations of motion of a three-dimensional geometrically exact rod, or the Cosserat rod, incorporating planar cross-sectional deformation. We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Enhanced Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow with Multi-Governor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure frequency security in power systems, both the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency nadir (FN) must be explicitly accounted for in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF). However, accurately modeling sys-tem frequency dynamics through analytical formulations is chal-lenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity. To address this issue, deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized to capture the nonlinear mapping between system operating condi-tions and key frequency performance metrics. In this paper, a DNN-based frequency prediction model is developed and trained using the high-fidelity time-domain simulation data generated in PSCAD/EMTDC. The trained DNN is subsequently transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) form and embedded into the FCOPF problem as additional con-straints to explicitly enforce frequency security, leading to the proposed DNN-FCOPF formulation. For benchmarking, two alternative models are considered: a conventional optimal power flow without frequency constraints and a linearized FCOPF in-corporating system-level RoCoF and FN constraints. The effec-tiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the solutions of these three models through extensive PSCAD/EMTDC time-domain simulations under various loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Attention-Based Multi-Agent PPO for Latency Spike Resolution in 6G RAN Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) radio access networks (RANs) must enforce strict service-level agreements (SLAs) for heterogeneous slices, yet sudden latency spikes remain difficult to diagnose and resolve with conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or explainable RL (XRL). We propose \emph{Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (AE-MAPPO)}, which integrates six specialized attention mechanisms into multi-agent slice control and surfaces them as zero-cost, faithful explanations. The framework operates across O-RAN timescales with a three-phase strategy: predictive, reactive, and inter-slice optimization.
  A URLLC case study shows AE-MAPPO resolves a latency spike in $18$ms, restores latency to $0.98$ms with $99.9999\%$ reliability, and reduces troubleshooting time by $93\%$ while maintaining eMBB and mMTC continuity. These results confirm AE-MAPPO's ability to combine SLA compliance with inherent interpretability, enabling trustworthy and real-time automation for 6G RAN slicing.</description>

      <title>Credit-Based vs. Discount-Based Congestion Pricing: A Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) and discount-based congestion pricing (DBCP), which respectively allot travel credits and toll discounts to subsidize low-income users' access to tolled roads, have emerged as promising policies for alleviating the societal inequity concerns of congestion pricing. However, since real-world implementations of CBCP and DBCP are nascent, their relative merits remain unclear. In this work, we compare the efficacy of deploying CBCP and DBCP in reducing user costs and increasing toll revenues. We first formulate a non-atomic congestion game in which low-income users receive a travel credit or toll discount for accessing tolled lanes. We establish that, in our formulation, Nash equilibrium flows always exist and can be computed or well approximated via convex programming. Our main result establishes a set of practically relevant conditions under which DBCP provably outperforms CBCP in inducing equilibrium outcomes that minimize a given societal cost, which encodes user cost reduction and toll revenue maximization. Finally, we validate our theoretical contributions via a case study of the 101 Express Lanes Project, a CBCP program implemented in the San Francisco Bay Area.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Trajectory Optimization for Bearing-Only Localization in GPS Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization of maritime targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging in GPS-denied environments. UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.</description>

      <title>Limits of Residual-Based Detection for Physically Consistent False Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False data injection attacks (FDIAs) pose a persistent challenge to AC power system state estimation. In current practice, detection relies primarily on topology-aware residual-based tests that assume malicious measurements can be distinguished from normal operation through physical inconsistency reflected in abnormal residual behavior. This paper shows that this assumption does not always hold: when FDIA scenarios produce manipulated measurements that remain on the measurement manifold induced by AC power flow relations and measurement redundancy, residual-based detectors may fail to distinguish them from nominal data. The resulting detectability limitation is a property of the measurement manifold itself and does not depend on the attacker's detailed knowledge of the physical system model. To make this limitation observable in practice, we present a data-driven constructive mechanism that incorporates the generic functional structure of AC power flow to generate physically consistent, manifold-constrained perturbations, providing a concrete witness of how residual-based detectors can be bypassed. Numerical studies on multiple AC test systems characterize the conditions under which detection becomes challenging and illustrate its failure modes. The results highlight fundamental limits of residual-based detection in AC state estimation and motivate the need for complementary defenses beyond measurement consistency tests.</description>

      <title>Non-Fungible Blockchain Tokens for Traceable Online-Quality Assurance of Milled Workpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a concept and implementation for the secure storage and transfer of quality-relevant data of milled workpieces from online-quality assurance processes enabled by real-time simulation models. It utilises Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) to securely and interoperably store quality data in the form of an Asset Administration Shell (AAS) on a public Ethereum blockchain. Minted by a custom smart contract, the NFTs reference the metadata saved in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), allowing new data from additional processing steps to be added in a flexible yet secure manner. The concept enables automated traceability throughout the value chain, minimising the need for time-consuming and costly repetitive manual quality checks.</description>

      <title>Device Applications of Heterogeneously Integrated Strain-Switched Ferrimagnets/Topological Insulator/Piezoelectric Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of ferrimagnets (CoV2O4, GdCo, TbCo) exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained compressively and in-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained expansively (or vice versa). If such a ferrimagnetic thin film is placed on top of a topological insulator (TI) thin film and its magnetic anisotropy is modulated with strain, then interfacial exchange coupling between the ferrimagnet (FM) and the underlying TI will modulate the surface current flowing through the latter. If the strain is varied continuously, the current will also vary continuously and if the strain alternates in time, the current will also alternate with the frequency of the strain modulation, as long as the frequency is not so high that the period is smaller than the switching time of the FM. If the strain is generated with a gate voltage by integrating a piezoelectric underneath the FM/TI stack, then that can implement a transconductance amplifier or a synapse for neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>The Infrastructure Equation: Water, Energy, and Community Policy for Georgia's Data Center Boom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers driven by cloud computing and artificial intelligence is reshaping infrastructure planning and environmental governance in the United States. Georgia has emerged as a major market for data center development, particularly in the Atlanta metropolitan region, creating economic opportunity alongside significant challenges. Data centers are water-intensive, energy-intensive, and land-intensive infrastructure whose cumulative impacts strain municipal water systems, electric grids, and local land-use frameworks. Unlike single industrial projects, data centers are often proposed in clusters, amplifying community and infrastructure impacts.
  This report draws on insights from a Georgia-based expert convening to describe the implications of data center growth for water management, energy reliability, ratepayer equity, zoning, and community engagement, identify potential gaps in transparency and regulatory coordination, and present a policy roadmap to help Georgia balance digital infrastructure growth with sustainability, equity, and community protection.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Packet-level Network Simulation of Large Model Training via Memoization and Fast-Forwarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packet-level discrete-event simulation (PLDES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating detailed performance of large model training. Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of &lt;1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of adaptive rewiring in Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores sparsification methods as a form of regularization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications. Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interference Management for TN-NTN Coexistence in the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of terrestrial networks (TN) and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in the frequency range 3 (FR3) upper mid-band presents considerable interference concerns, as dense TN deployments can severely degrade NTN downlink performance. Existing studies rely on interference-nulling beamforming, precoding, or exclusion zones that require accurate channel state information (CSI) and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction up to 8 dB in the median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods and validating the feasibility of the proposed strategy for FR3 coexistence.</description>

Abstract: Consider a subfield of the field of rational functions in several indeterminates. We present an algorithm that, given a set of generators of such a subfield, finds a simple generating set. We provide an implementation of the algorithm and show that it improves upon the state of the art both in efficiency and the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of simplified generators through several case studies from different application domains, such as structural parameter identifiability. The main algorithmic novelties include performing only partial Gr\"obner basis computation via sparse interpolation and efficient search for polynomials of a fixed degree in a subfield of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>Tuning the burn-in phase in training recurrent neural networks improves their performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by &gt;2.6x and fusion-delay variations by &gt;2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of streaming data in dynamic systems, a critical challenge in data-driven modeling for control is how to efficiently select informative data to characterize system dynamics. In this work, we develop an online coreset selection method for set-membership identification in the presence of process disturbances, improving data efficiency while preserving convergence guarantees. Specifically, we derive a stacked polyhedral representation that over-approximates the feasible parameter set. Based on this representation, we propose a geometric selection criterion that retains a data point only if it induces a sufficient contraction of the feasible set. Theoretically, the feasible-set volume is shown to converge to zero almost surely under persistently exciting data and a tight disturbance bound. When the disturbance bound is mismatched, an explicit Hausdorff-distance bound is derived to quantify the resulting identification error. In addition, an upper bound on the expected coreset size is established and extensions to nonlinear systems with linear-in-the-parameter structures and to bounded measurement noise are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Dynamic Tip-Over during Mobile Crane Slewing using Input Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Payload swing during rapid slewing of mobile cranes poses a safety risk, as it generates overturning moments that can lead to tip-over accidents of mobile cranes. Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents finite-time and fixed-time stabilization results for inhomogeneous abstract evolution problems, extending existing theories. We prove well-posedness for strong and weak solutions, and estimate upper bounds for settling times for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. We generalize finite-dimensional results to infinite-dimensional systems and demonstrate partial state stabilization with actuation on a subset of the domain. The interest of these results are illustrated through an application of a heat equation with memory term.</description>

      <title>Lateral tracking control of all-wheel steering vehicles with intelligent tires</title>

Abstract: The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies.</description>

      <title>First-order friction models with bristle dynamics: lumped and distributed formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09429</link>

Abstract: Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.</description>

      <title>Metareasoning in uncertain environments: a meta-BAMDP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Momentum Observer Contact Estimation for Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44% with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to enhance safety. Based on these constraints, the CMPC constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <title>HuMam: Humanoid Motion Control via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Control Bellman Residual Minimization for Markov Decision Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.</description>
