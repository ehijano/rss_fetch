      <title>May's Conjecture on Bimonoidal Functors and Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of May states that there is an up-to-adjunction strictification of symmetric bimonoidal functors between bipermutative categories. The main result of this paper proves a weaker form of May's conjecture that starts with multiplicatively strong symmetric bimonoidal functors. As the main application, for May's multiplicative infinite loop space machine from bipermutative categories to either E-infinity ring spaces or E-infinity ring spectra, multiplicatively strong symmetric bimonoidal functors can be replaced by strict symmetric bimonoidal functors.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce diffusion geometry as a new framework for geometric and topological data analysis. Diffusion geometry uses the Bakry-Emery $\Gamma$-calculus of Markov diffusion operators to define objects from Riemannian geometry on a wide range of probability spaces. We construct statistical estimators for these objects from a sample of data, and so introduce a whole family of new methods for geometric data analysis and computational geometry. This includes vector fields and differential forms on the data, and many of the important operators in exterior calculus. Unlike existing methods like persistent homology and local principal component analysis, diffusion geometry is explicitly related to Riemannian geometry, and is significantly more robust to noise, significantly faster to compute, provides a richer topological description (like the cup product on cohomology), and is naturally vectorised for statistics and machine learning. We find that diffusion geometry outperforms multiparameter persistent homology as a biomarker for real and simulated tumour histology data and can robustly measure the manifold hypothesis by detecting singularities in manifold-like data.</description>

      <title>Adams' cobar construction as a monoidal $E_{\infty}$-coalgebra model of the based loop space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the classical map comparing Adams' cobar construction on the singular chains of a pointed space and the singular cubical chains on its based loop space is a quasi-isomorphism preserving explicitly defined monoidal $E_\infty$-coalgebra structures. This contribution extends to its ultimate conclusion a result of Baues, stating that Adams' map preserves monoidal coalgebra structures.</description>

      <title>On multiplicative spectral sequences for nerves and the free loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a multiplicative spectral sequence converging to the cohomology algebra of the diagonal complex of a bisimplicial set with coefficients in a field. The construction provides a spectral sequence converging to the cohomology algebra of the classifying space of a topological category. By applying the machinery to a Borel construction, we determine explicitly the mod $p$ cohomology algebra of the free loop space of the real projective space for each odd prime $p$. This is highlighted as an important computational example of such a spectral sequence. Moreover, we try to represent generators in the singular de Rham cohomology algebra of the diffeological free loop space of a non-simply connected manifold $M$ with differential forms on the universal cover of $M$ via Chen's iterated integral map.</description>

      <title>$W$-triviality of low dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A space $X$ is $W$-trivial if for every real vector bundle $\alpha$ over $X$ the total Stiefel-Whitney class $w(\alpha)$ is 1. It follows from a result of Milnor that if $X$ is an orientable closed smooth manifold of dimension $1,2,4$ or $8$, then $X$ is not $W$-trivial. In this note we completely characterize $W$-trivial orientable connected closed smooth manifolds in dimensions $3,5$ and $6$. In dimension $7$, we describe necessary conditions for an orientable connected closed smooth $7$-manifold to be $W$-trivial.</description>

      <title>PL homeomorphisms of surfaces and codimension $2$ PL foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Haefliger-Thurston's conjecture predicts that Haefliger's classifying space for $C^r$-foliations of codimension $n$ whose normal bundles are trivial is $2n$-connected. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for PL foliations of codimension $2$. As a consequence, we use a version of Mather-Thurston's theorem for PL homeomorphisms due to the author to derive new homological properties for PL surface homeomorphisms. In particular, we answer a question of Epstein in dimension $2$ and prove the simplicity of the identity component of PL surface homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis in smart manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a discipline that applies algebraic topology techniques to analyze complex, multi-dimensional data. Although it is a relatively new field, TDA has been widely and successfully applied across various domains, such as medicine, materials science, and biology. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art of TDA within a dynamic and promising application area: industrial manufacturing and production, particularly within the Industry 4.0 context. We have conducted a rigorous and reproducible literature search focusing on TDA applications in industrial production and manufacturing settings. The identified works are categorized based on their application areas within the manufacturing process and the types of input data. We highlight the principal advantages of TDA tools in this context, address the challenges encountered and the future potential of the field. Furthermore, we identify TDA methods that are currently underexploited in specific industrial areas and discuss how their application could be beneficial, with the aim of stimulating further research in this field. This work seeks to bridge the theoretical advancements in TDA with the practical needs of industrial production. Our goal is to serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers applying TDA in industrial production and manufacturing systems. We advocate for the untapped potential of TDA in this domain and encourage continued exploration and research.</description>
