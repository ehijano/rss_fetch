      <title>HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands. IV. A Bayesian multicolor study of stellar parameters in the ONC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Particle Trapping and Acceleration in Turbulent Post-flare Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of energetic-electron trapping and acceleration in the Kelvin-Helmholtz-induced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence of post-flare loops in the solar corona. Using the particle-tracing capabilities of MPI-AMRVAC 3.0, we evolve ensembles of test electrons (i.e. without feedback to the underlying MHD) inside the turbulent looptop, using the guiding-center approximation. With the MHD looptop model of Ruan et al. 2018, we investigate the relation between turbulence and particle trapping inside the looptop structure, showing that better-developed turbulent cascades result in more efficient trapping primarily due to mirror effects. We then quantify the electron acceleration in the time-evolving MHD turbulence, and find that ideal-MHD processes inside the looptop can produce nonthermal particle spectra from an initial Maxwellian distribution. Electrons in this turbulence are preferentially accelerated by mirror effects in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field while remaining confined within small regions of space between magnetic islands. Assuming dominance of Bremsstrahlung radiation mechanisms, we employ the resulting information from accelerated electrons (combined with the MHD background) to construct HXR spectra of the post-flare loop that include nonthermal-particle contributions. Our results pave the way to constructing more realistic simulations of radiative coronal structure for comparison with current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Observations of spiral and streamer on a candidate proto-brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spirals and streamers are the hallmarks of mass accretion during the early stages of star formation. We present the first observations of a large-scale spiral and a streamer towards a very young brown dwarf candidate in its early formation stages. These observations show, for the first time, the influence of external environment that results in asymmetric mass accretion via feeding filaments onto a candidate proto-brown dwarf in the making. The impact of the streamer has produced emission in warm carbon-chain species close to the candidate proto-brown dwarf. Two contrasting scenarios, a pseudo-disk twisted by core rotation and the collision of dense cores, can both explain these structures. The former argues for the presence of a strong magnetic field in brown dwarf formation while the latter suggests that a minimal magnetic field allows large-scale spirals and clumps to form far from the candidate proto-brown dwarf.</description>

      <title>Calibration of VELC detectors on-board Aditya-L1 mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space mission to explore the Sun and solar atmosphere with seven multi-wavelength payloads, with Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) being the prime payload. It is an internally occulted coronagraph with four channels to image the Sun at 5000 \AA~ in the field of view 1.05 - 3 \rsun, and to pursue spectroscopy at 5303 \AA, 7892 \AA~ and 10747 \AA~ channels in the FOV (1.05 - 1.5 \rsun). In addition, spectropolarimetry is planned at 10747 \AA~ channel. Therefore, VELC has three sCMOS detectors and one InGaAs detector. In this article, we aim to describe the technical details and specifications of the detectors achieved by way of thermo-vacuum calibration at the CREST campus of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India. Furthermore, we report the estimated conversion gain, full-well capacity, and readout noise at different temperatures. Based on the numbers, it is thus concluded that it is essential to operate the sCMOS detectors and InGaAs detectors at $-5^{\circ}$ and $-17^{\circ}$ C, respectively, at the spacecraft level.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Slowing of Stellar Differential Rotation by Instability-Driven Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich--Schubert--Fricke (GSF) instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing angular momentum gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat, and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or ``parasitic saturation" models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Persistent Upflows and Downflows at Active Region boundaries Observed by SUTRI and AIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upflows and downflows at active region (AR) boundaries have been frequently observed with spectroscopic observations at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands. In this paper, we report the coexistence of upflows and downflows at the AR boundaries with imaging observations from the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). With their observations from 2022 September 21 to 2022 September 30, we find 17 persistent opposite flows occurring along the AR coronal loops. The upflows are prominent in the AIA 193 \AA images with a velocity of 50-200 km/s, while the downflows are best seen in the SUTRI 465 \AA and AIA 131 \AA images with a slower velocity of tens of kilometers per second (characteristic temperatures (log T(K)) for 193 \AA, 465 \AA and 131 \AA are 6.2, 5.7, 5.6, respectively). We also analyze the center-to-limb variation of the velocities for both upflows and downflows. The simultaneous observations of downflows and upflows can be explained by the chromosphere-corona mass-cycling process, in which the localized chromospheric plasma is impulsively heated to coronal temperature forming a upflow and then these upflows experience radiative cooling producing a downflow with the previously heated plasma returning to the lower atmosphere. In particular, the persistent downflows seen by SUTRI provide strong evidence of the cooling process in the mass cycle. For upflows associated with open loops, part of the plasma is able to escape outward and into the heliosphere as solar wind.</description>

      <title>Rotational Evolution of Classical T Tauri Stars: Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a grid of stellar rotation models for low-mass and solar-type Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) ($0.3M_{\odot}&lt;M_{\ast}&lt;1.2M_{\odot}$). These models incorporate the star-disk interaction and magnetospheric ejections to investigate the evolution of the stellar rotation rate as a function of the mass of the star $M_{\ast}$, the magnetic field ($B_{\ast}$), and stellar wind ($\dot{M}_{wind}$). We compiled and determined stellar parameters for 208 CTTS, such as projected rotational velocity $v\sin(i)$, mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{acc}$, stellar mass $M_{\ast}$, ages, and estimated rotational periods using TESS data. We also estimated a representative value of the mass-loss rate for our sample using the $[\text{O}\text{ I}]$ spectral line. Our results confirm that $v\sin(i)$ measurements in CTTS agree with the rotation rates provided by our spin models in the accretion-powered stellar winds (APSW) picture. In addition, we used the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) technique to explore the connection between the model parameters and the observational properties of CTTS. We find that the evolution of $v\sin(i)$ with age might be regulated by variations in (1) the intensity of $B_{\ast}$ and (2) the fraction of the accretion flow ejected in magnetic winds, removing angular momentum from these systems. The youngest stars in our sample ($\sim $1 Myr) show a median branching ratio $\dot{M}_{wind}/\dot{M}_{acc}\sim$ $0.16$ and median $B_{\ast}\sim$ 2000 G, in contrast to $\sim 0.01$ and 1000 G, respectively, for stars with ages $\gtrsim 3$ Myr.</description>

      <title>Precision timing of eclipsing binaries from TESS full frame images. Method and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of $\sim$100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of ten new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than $\sim$1300$\,$d. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4 per cent for SC and 12 per cent for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two datasets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component's mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which dataset is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.</description>

      <title>FAUST XI: Enhancement of the complex organic material in the shocked matter surrounding the [BHB2007] 11 protobinary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: iCOMs are species commonly found in the interstellar medium. They are believed to be crucial seed species for the build-up of chemical complexity in star forming regions as well as our own Solar System. Thus, understanding how their abundances evolve during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging planetary system is of paramount importance. We use data from the ALMA Large Program FAUST to study the compact line emission towards the [BHB2007] 11 proto-binary system (sources A and B), where a complex structure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary disk has previously been detected. More than 45 CH3OCHO lines are clearly detected, as well as 8 CH3OCH3 transitions , 1 H2CCO transition and 4 t-HCOOH transitions. We compute the abundance ratios with respect to CH3OH for CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, H2CCO, t-HCOOH (as well as an upper limit for CH3CHO) through a radiative transfer analysis. We also report the upper limits on the column densities of nitrogen bearing iCOMs, N(C2H5CN) and N(C2H3CN). The emission from the detected iCOMs and their precursors is compact and encompasses both protostars, which are separated by only 0.2" (~ 28 au). The integrated intensities tend to align with the Southern filament, revealed by the high spatial resolution observations of the dust emission at 1.3 mm. A PV and 2D analysis are performed on the strongest and uncontaminated CH3OCH3 transition and show three different spatial and velocity regions, two of them being close to 11B (Southern filament) and the third one near 11A. All our observations suggest that the detected methanol, as well as the other iCOMs, are generated by the shocked gas from the incoming filaments streaming towards [BHB2007] 11A and 11B, respectively, making this source one of the few where chemical enrichment of the gas caused by the streaming material is observed.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravomagneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseuodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity, leading to gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of order unity or more. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution ALMA observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Spikes Observed by PSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio burst (SRB) event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its 8th orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hours in a frequency range of 0.5-15 MHz, called the type IV-like SRB. This type IV-like SRB consists of a series of numerous spikes with the center-frequency drifting slowly from ~5 MHz to ~1 MHz, and each individual spike appears a much faster frequency drifting and has a narrow frequency range of a few MHz and short duration of a few minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in-situ measurement by PSP, we propose that these small-scale spikes were generated by a group of solitary kinetic Alfv\'en waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME) and moving outwards, in which the frequency drifting of individual spike is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the center-frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Refinements to Metallicity-Dependent Isotopic Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to fit the free parameters of an isotopic scaling model to elemental observations. The processes considered are massive star nucleosynthesis, Type Ia SNe, the s-process, the r-process, and p-isotope production. The analysis on the successful fits seeks to minimize the reduced chi squared between the model and the data. Based upon the successful refinement of the isotopic parameterized scaling model, a table providing the 287 stable isotopic abundances as a function of metallicity, separated into astrophysical processes, is useful for identifying the chemical history of them. The table provides a complete averaged chemical history for the Galaxy, subject to the underlying model constraints.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XI. Statistical Study of Early Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within thirty-nine high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present sub-clump structures revealed by the 7 m-array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and sub-clump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of sub-clumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and sub-clustered. Using the Q-parameter, which can help to distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation with Absorption of Astrophysical Gamma-rays by Solar Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron positron pairs. This effect is greatest for $\gamma$-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-2}$. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of $\gamma$-ray sources near the Sun at $\gtrsim20$ TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.</description>

      <title>To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are crucial in understanding high-mass X-ray binaries, featuring a rapidly rotating Be star and a neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from the Be star's decretion disk. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the POSYDON BPS code, employing pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling a detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a bimodal rotational distribution of Be-XRB-like systems, in excellent agreement with literature values. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we find that the majority of Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT (beta ~ 0.15). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Free-Floating Planets, Survivor Planets, Captured Planets and Binary Planets from Stellar Flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study on the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system (with a modest initial planet semi-major axis ratio, $a_1/a_2=0.6-0.8$) experiences stellar flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving-planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs as a function of the pericenter separation of the flyby (in units of the initial planet semi-major axis), and use them to derive the analytical expressions that can be used to compute the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar, while the rate for CPs is a factor of a few smaller. The formation fraction of free-floating BPs depends strongly on $a_1/a_2$ of the initial systems and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than $1\%$ (for systems with $a_1/a_2=0.8$) and typically much smaller ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ for $a_1/a_2\lesssim 0.7$). The fraction remains less than $1\%$ when considering $4M_{\rm J}$ planets. Overall, when averaging over all possible flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than $0.1\%$ of that for FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions of SSPs, CPs and (rare) free-floating BPs. These results can find applications in future studies of exotic planets and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Constrain Tidal Quality Factor from A Non-synchronized Exoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to constrain the tidal quality factor, $Q'$, from a non-synchronized star-planet system consisting of a slowly rotating low-mass star and a close-in Jovian planet, taking into account the tidal interaction and the magnetic braking. On the basis of dynamical system theory, the track of the co-evolution of angular momentum for such a system exhibits the existence of a forbidden region in the $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ -- $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ plane , where $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ denote the angular velocity of the stellar spin and planetary orbit, respectively. The forbidden region is determined primarily by the strength of the tidal interaction. By comparing ($\Omega_\mathrm{orb},\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$) of a single star-planet system to the forbidden region, we can constrain the tidal quality factor regardless of the evolutionary history of the system. The application of this method to the star-planet system, NGTS-10 -- NGTS-10 b, gives $Q' \gtrsim 10^8$, leading to an tight upper bound on the tidal torque. Since this cannot be explained by previous theoretical predictions for non-synchronized star-planet systems, our result requires mechanisms that suppress the tidal interaction in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although there is abundant and diverse observational evidence in support of white dwarf stars hosting planets or debris disks which form in the catastrophic destruction of various planetary bodies, the key processes that explain these observations are still being intensely investigated. The study of white dwarf planetary systems offers a unique perspective on exo-solar composition, that cannot be obtained by any other means. This chapter describes the various observational techniques that are used in order to find and characterize exo-planets and debris disks around white dwarfs. In turn, it discusses how to theoretically interpret these observations by surveying an array of various research tools and models currently employed in this field.</description>

      <title>FOXSI-2: Upgrades of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager for its Second Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket payload flew for the second time on 2014 December 11. To enable direct Hard X-Ray (HXR) imaging spectroscopy, FOXSI makes use of grazing-incidence replicated focusing optics combined with fine-pitch solid-state detectors. FOXSI's first flight provided the first HXR focused images of the Sun. For FOXSI's second flight several updates were made to the instrument including updating the optics and detectors as well as adding a new Solar Aspect and Alignment System (SAAS). This paper provides an overview of these updates as well as a discussion of their measured performance.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radiation and magnetospheric accretion flow in ULX pulsars: radiation pressure and photon escape time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion flow within the magnetospheric radius of bright X-ray pulsars can form an optically thick envelope, concealing the central neutron star from the distant observer. Most photons are emitted at the surface of a neutron star and leave the system after multiple reflections by the accretion material covering the magnetosphere. Reflections cause momentum to be transferred between photons and the accretion flow, which contributes to the radiative force and should thus influence the dynamics of accretion. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and estimate the acceleration along magnetic field lines due to the radiative force as well as the radiation pressure across magnetic field lines. We demonstrate that the radiative acceleration can exceed gravitational acceleration along the field lines, and similarly, radiation pressure can exceed magnetic field pressure. Multiple reflections of X-ray photons back into the envelope tend to amplify both radiative force along the field lines and radiative pressure. We analyze the average photon escape time from the magnetosphere of a star and show that its absolute value is weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength of a star and roughly linearly dependent on the mass accretion rate being $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$ at $\dot{M}\sim 10^{20}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$. At high mass accretion rates, the escape time can be longer than free-fall time from the inner disc radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The easiest exoplanets to detect are those that orbit very close to their hoststars. As a result, even though these planets are quite rare, they represent amajor fraction of the current exoplanet population. A side-effect of theproximity between the planet and the star is that the two have strong mutualinteractions through a number of physical processes. One of the most importantof these processes is tides. Tides are thought to shape the orbits of close-inexoplanets, heat the planet making its radius expand, and even drive someplanets to spiral into their host stars. This chapter briefly introduces thebasics of tidal physics and describes the various fingerprints tides leavewithin the observed exoplanet population.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolving the AGB star V3 in the metal-poor globular cluster 47 Tuc with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass loss at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) plays an important role not only in the final fates of stars, but also in the chemical evolution of galaxies. Nevertheless, the metallicity effects on AGB mass loss are not yet fully understood. We present spatially resolved observations of an AGB star, V3, in the metal-poor globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104). The AGB star 47 Tuc V3 was observed using the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2-2.45 micron with a projected baseline length of up to 96 m. The object 47 Tuc V3 has been spatially resolved and stands as the first to attempt to spatially resolve an individual star in a globular cluster. The uniform-disk fit to the observed data results in an angular diameter of ~0.7 mas. Our modeling of the spectral energy distribution and near-infrared interferometric GRAVITY data suggests that the observed data can be explained by an optically thin dust shell with a 0.55 micron optical depth of 0.05-0.25, consisting of metallic iron grains, likely together with effects of the extended atmosphere of the central star. The dust temperature at the inner shell boundary is 500-800 K (corresponding to 23-90 stellar radii), significantly lower than observed in nearby oxygen-rich AGB stars. Radiation pressure on small (&lt; 0.05 micron) iron grains is not sufficient to drive stellar winds. Therefore, iron grains may grow to larger sizes, even in the metal-poor environment. Alternatively, it is possible that the observed iron grain formation is a result of the mass outflow initiated by some other mechanism(s). The sensitivity and angular resolution of VLTI provides a new window onto spatially resolving individual stars in metal-poor globular clusters. This allows us to improve subsequent studies of the metallicity dependence of dust formation and mass loss.</description>
