      <title>Local Volatility in Interest Rate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13595v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local Volatility (LV) is a very powerful tool for market modeling. This tool can be used to generate arbitrage-free scenarios calibrated to all available options. Here we demonstrate how to implement LV in order to reproduce most swaption prices within a single model.
  There was a good agreement between market prices and Monte Carlo prices for all tenors and maturities from 2 to 20 years. Note that due to the use of a normal distribution in the scenario generation process, the volatility of short-term swaptions cannot be generated accurately.</description>

      <title>Joint Calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>
