      <title>New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description>

      <title>AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description>

      <title>From Fermat's Principle to Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Unified Computational Approach to Variational Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational principles are a unifying mathematical framework across many areas of physics, yet their instruction at the undergraduate level remains primarily analytical. This work presents a pedagogically oriented and computationally enhanced approach to variational modeling that integrates contemporary tools including gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Classical variational problems are reformulated as optimization tasks and implemented using open-source Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and JAX. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a progression of problems drawn from standard undergraduate curricula, including the derivation of Snell's law from Fermat's principle, projectile motion with and without viscous drag, simple harmonic motion, nonlinear pendulum with damping, steady-state heat conduction governed by the Laplace and Poisson equations with nonlinear temperature-dependent internal heat generation, the double pendulum via the principle of least action, and variational treatments of vibrating strings. In addition, quantum mechanical applications are presented through variational solutions of the hydrogen atom, helium atom, and a schematic nuclear model of the silicon nucleus, illustrating the breadth of the framework across classical, quantum, and nuclear physics. The approach aims to enhance conceptual understanding while simultaneously introducing students to modern computational research methodologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Stiff Dynamical Operators: Scaling, Fast-Slow Excitation, and Eigen-Consistent Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stiff dynamical systems represent a central challenge in multi scale modeling across combustion, chemical kinetics, and nonlinear dynamical systems. Neural operator learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to approximate dynamical generators from data, yet stiffness imposes severe obstacles: training errors concentrate on slow manifold states, collapse of fast dynamics occurs, and the learned operator may fail to reproduce the true eigenstructure.
  We demonstrate three key advances enabling accurate learning of stiff operators and preserving spectral fidelity: (i) stiffness aware scaling of time derivatives, (ii) fast direction excitation via local trajectory cloud bursts, and (iii) autograd-based Jacobian diagnostics ensuring eigenstructure fidelity. Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity. These results argue that spectral fidelity - not trajectory accuracy alone - should be a first-class target in data driven learning of stiff operators.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum embedding at finite temperature with density matrix embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature extension of density matrix embedding theory (FT-DMET) for realistic crystalline systems. We describe a practical framework for constructing extended bath orbitals, solving the embedding problem, and performing DMET self-consistency at finite temperature. To reduce computational cost, we introduce strategies based on mutual-information-guided bath truncation, controlled treatment of the thermal electron number without explicit optimization, and the use of low-temperature impurity solvers and one-shot FT-DMET in the low-temperature regime. We apply this approach to periodic hydrogen chains and square lattices to characterize their finite-temperature phases. We observe the Pomeranchuk-like effect in one dimension and enhanced stability of long-range order in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>LLMize: A Framework for Large Language Model-Based Numerical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>thornado+Flash-X: A Hybrid DG-IMEX and Finite-Volume Framework for Neutrino-Radiation Hydrodynamics in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present neutrino-transport algorithms implemented in the toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (thornado) and their coupling to self-gravitating hydrodynamics within the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based multiphysics simulation framework Flash-X. thornado, developed primarily for simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), employs a spectral, six-species two-moment formulation with algebraic closure and special-relativistic observer corrections accurate to $O(v/c)$, and uses discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for phase-space discretization combined with implicit-explicit time stepping. A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation. Together, these results establish a foundation for future enhancements in physics fidelity, numerical algorithms, and computational performance, for increasingly realistic large-scale CCSN simulations.</description>

      <title>Strain-triggered high-temperature superconducting transition in two-dimensional carbon allotrope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.</description>

      <title>A quadratic-scaling algorithm with guaranteed convergence for quantum coupled-channel calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Deep Learning with Quantum Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of deep neural networks comes at the cost of unsustainable power consumption. While optical neural networks offer an alternative, their capabilities remain constrained by the lack of efficient optical nonlinearities. To address this, we propose an all-optical deep learning architecture by embedding quantum emitters in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/{\mu}m^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude. System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation. Our results indicate that quantum nanophotonics provides a route toward sustainable AI inference.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sparse modeling and decomposition for superspreading-wetting dynamics of a droplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superspreading wetting is traditionally attributed to surfactant-driven mechanisms. However, recent observations of superspreading in surfactant-free nanofluids defy standard theoretical explanations. This study considers a data-driven approach to model droplet dynamics with the thickness of liquid films on the nanometer-micrometer scale in a compact form of a partial differential equation. We examine spatiotemporal film-thickness profiles resolved at the nanometer scale via phase-shifting imaging ellipsometry. For a pure solvent, the present governing equation recovers the classical lubrication physics driven by disjoining pressure and evaporation. In contrast, the nanofluid dynamics necessitates a unique transport term scaling with the gradient of the inverse film thickness. Theoretical analysis suggests this term represents a nanoparticle-induced bias flux, consistent with a hypothesized capillary wicking mechanism within the precursor film. The identification of the current nanofluid-specific term underscores the efficacy of integrating high-precision experimental measurements with data-driven modeling to unravel complex wetting dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation is inherently hybrid, and fast classical manipulation of qubit operators is necessary to ensure scalability in quantum software. We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations.</description>

      <title>Causal Multi-fidelity Surrogate Forward and Inverse Models for ICF Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high-dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic, multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics. Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.</description>

      <title>Invariance of quantum scattering rate coefficients to anisotropy of atom-molecule interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials with spin splitting have attracted considerable attention for their symmetry-enabled anisotropic spin textures that sustain a zero net magnetization, thereby facilitating efficient spin-current generation. In this work, the highly efficient generation of nonrelativistic spin currents is demonstrated to be facilitated by the distinctive Fermi surface geometry of X-type collinear antiferromagnets. As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, the spin current polarization is controlled by the orientation of the N\'eel vector. When the N\'eel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Bridging Visual Intuition and Chemical Expertise: An Autonomous Analysis Framework for Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations via Mentor-Engineer-Student Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics trajectories traditionally heavily relies on expert intuition and visual pattern recognition, a process that is difficult to formalize. We present VisU, a vision-driven framework that leverages the complementary strengths of two state-of-the-art large language models to establish a "virtual research collective." This collective operates through a "Mentor-Engineer-Student" paradigm that mimics the collaborative intelligence of a professional chemistry laboratory. Within this ecosystem, the Mentor provides physical intuition through visual reasoning, while the Engineer adaptively constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline and manages the data and results. VisU autonomously orchestrates a four-stage workflow comprising Preprocessing, Recursive Channel Discovery, Important-Motion Identification, and Validation/Summary. This systematic approach identifies reaction channels and key nuclear motions while generating professional academic reports. By bridging visual insight with chemical expertise, VisU establishes a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in the analysis of excited-state dynamics simulation results, significantly reducing dependence on manual interpretation and enabling more intuitive, scalable mechanistic discovery.</description>
