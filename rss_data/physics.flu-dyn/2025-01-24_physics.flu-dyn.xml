      <title>Deciphering boundary layer dynamics in high-Rayleigh-number convection using 3360 GPUs and a high-scaling in-situ workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent heat and momentum transfer processes due to thermal convection cover many scales and are of great importance for several natural and technical flows. One consequence is that a fully resolved three-dimensional analysis of these turbulent transfers at high Rayleigh numbers, which includes the boundary layers, is possible only using supercomputers. The visualization of these dynamics poses an additional hurdle since the thermal and viscous boundary layers in thermal convection fluctuate strongly. In order to track these fluctuations continuously, data must be tapped at high frequency for visualization, which is difficult to achieve using conventional methods. This paper makes two main contributions in this context. First, it discusses the simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to Rayleigh numbers of $Ra=10^{12}$ computed with NekRS on GPUs. The largest simulation was run on 840 nodes with 3360 GPU on the JUWELS Booster supercomputer. Secondly, an in-situ workflow using ASCENT is presented, which was successfully used to visualize the high-frequency turbulent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Flying shape and aerodynamics of a full-scale flexible Olympic windsurf sail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D flying shape of a real-scale 8 square meters iQFOiL class windsurf sail is measured in steady state sailing configurations. The sea wind flow conditions are simulated in a large-scale wind tunnel and stereo camera imaging technique ensure the flying shape reconstruction. Sail form reconstruction allows to measure the twist of the sail profiles from bottom to top. Simultaneous aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the sail are measured via an embedded force balance. With the measured forces and moments the lift, drag and roll coefficients are determined for various wind intensity. A systematic reduction of these coefficients is observed as compared to previous studies on reduced-scale rigid sail model. We suggest that the sail deformation in the wind is crucial to explain these reductions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Turbulence Structure In Street-Canyon Flows using Deep Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high dimensionality and complex dynamics of turbulent flows in urban street canyons present significant challenges for wind and environmental engineering, particularly in addressing air quality, pollutant dispersion, and extreme wind events. This study introduces a deep learning framework to predict spatio-temporal flow behavior in street canyons with varying geometric configurations and upstream roughness conditions. A convolutional encoder-decoder transformer model, trained on particle image velocimetry (PIV) data from wind tunnel experiments, is employed with autoregressive training to predict flow characteristics. The training dataset contains diverse flow regimes, with a focus on the wall-parallel plane near the canyon roof, a critical region for pollutant exchange between the outer flow and the canyon interior. The model accurately reproduces key flow features, including mean turbulent statistics, two-point correlations, quadrant analysis, and dominant flow structures, while demonstrating strong agreement with experimental data in capturing the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models to enhance predictive capabilities for urban canyon flows, offering a pathway toward improved urban design, sustainable environmental management, and more effective pollutant dispersion modeling.</description>

      <title>Particle migration in areas of constricted flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Among them, some are linked to stenosis, which is an abnormal narrowing of blood vessels, as well as other factors. Smart drug delivery systems based on micro- and nanoparticles are a promising method to offer non/minimal-invasive therapeutic mechanisms. Here we investigate the propensity of particles with different shapes and sizes to drift laterally (marginate) towards an occlusion area in a two-dimensional (2D) parallel plate laminar flow using the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). To verify the outcomes on both sides of the stenosis, a probability of adhesion to the borders was calculated. Analysis was done on the impact of wall-shear stress on both sides of the stenosis. Our results show that non-circular particles migrate in larger amounts and earlier than circular ones.</description>

      <title>On the flow characteristics in the shock formation region due to the diaphragm opening process in a shock tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shock formation process in shock tubes has been extensively studied; however, significant gaps remain in understanding the effects of the diaphragm rupture process on the resulting flow non-uniformities. Existing models predicting the shock attenuation and propagation dynamics overlook critical diaphragm mechanics and their impact on shock behavior. Addressing this gap is vital for improving predictive capabilities and optimizing shock tube designs for applications in combustion kinetics, aerodynamics, and high-speed diagnostics. This study investigates the shock wave formation and propagation through combined experimental and numerical approaches over a range of driver-to-driven pressure ratios (Driver pressure: 9.4 - 24.2 bar of helium; Driven pressure: 100 Torr of argon). High-speed imaging captures the diaphragm opening dynamics, while pressure and shock velocity measurements along the entire driven section of the shock tube provide key validation data for CFD. Two-dimensional numerical simulations incorporate experimentally measured diaphragm opening profiles, offering detailed insights into flow features and thermodynamic gradients behind the moving shock front. Key parameters, including deceleration and acceleration phases within the shock formation region, shock formation distances, and times, have been quantified. A novel theoretical framework is introduced to correlate these parameters, enabling accurate predictions of shock Mach number evolution under varying conditions. This unified methodology bridges theoretical and experimental gaps, providing a robust foundation for advancing shock tube research and design.</description>

      <title>Influence of inertial confinement on laser-induced bubble generation and shock wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced breakdown with ultrashort laser pulses is isochoric and inertially confined. It is characterized by a sequence of nonlinear energy deposition and hydrodynamics events such as shock wave emission and cavitation bubble formation. With nanosecond pulses, inertial confinement is lost especially during micro- and nanobubble generation and energy deposition and hydrodynamic events occur concurrently. The onset of bubble expansion during the laser pulse reduces peak pressure, bubble wall velocity, conversion into mechanical energy, and prevents shock wave formation. Here we present an extension of the Gilmore model of bubble dynamics in a compressible liquid that enables to describe the interplay between particle velocity during acoustic transient emission and bubble wall acceleration in the inertial fluid at any degree of confinement. Energy deposition during a finite laser pulse duration is encoded in the time evolution of the bubble's equilibrium radius such that no explicit description of phase transitions is required. The model is used to simulate bubble generation, acoustic transient emission and energy partitioning as a function of laser pulse duration and bubble size at fixed plasma energy density and ambient pressure. It turns out that bubble formation with femtosecond laser pulses is more disruptive than with nanosecond pulses. This applies mainly for micro- and nano-cavitation but to a lesser degree also for millimeter-sized bubbles. We discuss implications for process control in microsurgery and microfluidic manipulation with free-focused laser pulses and via nanoparticle-mediated energy deposition.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Analysis of Droplet Morphology in Inkjet Systems: Toward Generating Stable Single-Drop Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for new microelectronic devices and pharmaceutical advancements has heightened interest in inkjet printing as a means of high-precision manufacturing technique. This study leverages data-driven analyses to optimize droplet generation processes in a drop-on-demand dispensing system. A three-voltage pulse scheme was employed to produce droplets, with high-resolution images captured and processed to extract geometric features of the principal droplet. This resulted in a comprehensive, openly published dataset, along with a detailed, reproducible image processing pipeline. By analyzing this data, we identified key operational parameters and established correlations between inputs and outputs, providing insights into consistent single-droplet generation. These findings offer practical guidelines for controlling droplet morphology and advancing applications in inkjet printing.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>Effects of Transverse Force on Dusty Fluid Flow over a Linear Stretching Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a numerical investigation of the flow and heat transfer of a steady dusty flow over a linear horizontal stretching sheet. Transverse force effects have been taken into account. The flow problems formulation comprises of highly nonlinear PDEs that have been transformed into systems of ODEs by using similarity transformation. Then the ODEs has been solved numerically by using Shooting technique followed by Runge-Kutta 4th order method that is incorporated in BVP4C tool of the MATLAB software. The effects various flow parameters, such as the Prandtl number, Eckert number and transverse force on the flow geometry has been investigated. The overall findings are displayed in graphs and tables, and it is discovered that the transverse force reduces the velocity of the particle phase in the flow. Our results has been validated with existing literatures and found agrees with very good way.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for microflows: Rarefied Gas Dynamics in Cylinder Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of rarefied gas dynamics is crucial for optimizing flows through microelectromechanical systems, air filtration devices, and shale gas extraction. Traditional methods, such as discrete velocity and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), demand intensive memory and computation, especially for microflows in non-convex domains. Recently, physics-informed neural networks emerged as a meshless and adaptable alternative for solving non-linear partial differential equations. We trained a PINN using a limited number of DSMC-generated rarefied gas microflows in the transition regime with Knudsen number from 0.1 to 3, incorporating continuity and Cauchy momentum exchange equations in the loss function. The PINN achieved under 2 percent error on these residuals and effectively filtered DSMC intrinsic statistical noise. Predictions remained strong for a tested flow field with Kn equal to 0.7, and showed limited extrapolation performance on a flow field with Kn equal to 5 with a local overshoot of about 20 percent, while maintaining physical consistency. Notably, each DSMC field required about 20 hours on 4 graphics processing units (GPU), while the PINN training took less than 2 hours on one GPU, with evaluations under 2 seconds.</description>

      <title>Solving continuum and rarefied flows using differentiable programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multi-scale flows remains a formidable challenge. Constructing theoretical models and numerical methods often involves the design and optimization of parameters. While gradient descent methods have been mainly manifested to shine in the wave of deep learning, composable automatic differentiation can advance scientific computing where the application of classical adjoint methods alone is infeasible or cumbersome. Differentiable programming provides a novel paradigm that unifies data structures and control flows and facilitates gradient-based optimization of parameters in a computer program. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the first solution algorithm for multi-scale flow physics across continuum and rarefied regimes based on differentiable programming. The fully differentiable simulator provides a unified framework for the convergence of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning, i.e., scientific machine learning. Specifically, parameterized mechanical-neural flow models and numerical methods can be constructed for forward physical processes, while the parameters can be trained on the fly with the help of the gradients that are taken through the backward passes of the whole simulation program, a.k.a., end-to-end optimization. As a result, versatile data-driven modeling and simulation can be achieved for physics discovery, surrogate modeling, and simulation acceleration. The fundamentals and implementation of the solution algorithm are demonstrated in detail. Numerical experiments, including forward and inverse problems for hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the numerical method. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are available under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Assessment of PINN Inference on Experimental Data for Gravity Currents Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer velocity and pressure field from Light Attenuation Technique (LAT) measurements for gravity current induced by lock-exchange. In a PINN model, physical laws are embedded in the loss function of a neural network, such that the model fits the training data but is also constrained to reduce the residuals of the governing equations. PINNs are able to solve ill-posed inverse problems training on sparse and noisy data, and therefore can be applied to real engineering applications. The noise robustness of PINNs and the model parameters are investigated in a 2 dimensions toy case on a lock-exchange configuration, employing synthetic data. Then we train a PINN with experimental LAT measurements and quantitatively compare the velocity fields inferred to Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements performed simultaneously on the same experiment.The results state that accurate and useful quantities can be derived from a PINN model trained on real experimental data which is encouraging for a better description of gravity currents.</description>

      <title>Influence of the downstream blade sweep on cross-flow turbine performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbine (known as vertical-axis wind turbines or ``VAWTs'' in wind) blades encounter a relatively undisturbed inflow for the first half of each rotational cycle (``upstream sweep'') and then pass through their own wake for the latter half (``downstream sweep''). While most research on cross-flow turbine optimization focuses on the power-generating upstream sweep, we use single-bladed turbine experiments to show that the downstream sweep strongly affects time-averaged performance. We find that power generation from the upstream sweep continues to increase beyond the optimal tip-speed ratio. In contrast, the downstream sweep consumes power beyond the optimal tip-speed ratio due to unfavorable lift and drag directions relative to rotation and a potentially detrimental pitching moment arising from rotation-induced virtual camber. Downstream power degradation increases faster than upstream power generation, such that downstream sweep performance determines the optimal tip-speed ratio. In addition to performance measurements, particle image velocimetry data is obtained inside the turbine swept area at three tip-speed ratios. This illuminates the mechanisms underpinning the observed performance degradation in the downstream sweep and motivates an analytical model for a limiting case with high induction. Performance results are shown to be consistent across 55 unique combinations of chord-to-radius ratio, preset pitch angle, and Reynolds number, underscoring the general significance of the downstream sweep.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Model of Early Atherosclerotic Plaque Development with LDL Toxicity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease in which fatty plaque is built inside an artery wall. Early atherosclerotic plaque development is typically characterized by inflammatory tissues primarily consisting of foam cells and macrophages. We present a biphasic model that explores early plaque growth to emphasize the role of cytokines (particularly, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in monocyte recruitment and foam cell production, respectively. The plaque boundary is assumed to move at the same speed as the inflammatory tissues close to the periphery. This study discusses the oxLDL cholesterols recruitment inside intima and their internalization by the inflammatory cells. Excessive intracellular cholesterol accumulation becomes toxic to macrophage foam cells, leading to cell death beyond a threshold. Our findings reveal that initially, the plaque evolves rapidly, and the growth rate eventually reduces because of the cholesterol-induced toxicity. The present study manifests that higher oxLDL cholesterol flux reduces plaque growth rate, while elevated cytokines flux promotes the corresponding plaque growth behaviour. Between oxLDL cholesterol and intracellular cholesterol, the second one is much more effective towards the growth of inflammatory tissue. The cholesterol-based toxicity-induced cell death parameters are crucial in flattening the plaque growth profile. A detailed analysis of the model presented in this article provides critical insights into the various biochemical and cellular mechanisms behind early plaque development.</description>

Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-di\-men\-sion\-al parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it improves on standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems. We discuss how the particular architecture enables exact representation of target states and higher order series expansions of the nonlinear feedback law at little extra computational effort in the online phase and how the linear though high-dimensional and nonstandard Lyapunov equations are efficiently computed during the offline phase. In a numerical study, we illustrate the procedure and how this approach can reliably outperform the standard linear-quadratic regulator design.</description>

      <title>ASTERIX: Module for modelling the water flow on vegetated hillslopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an open source software for numerical integration of an extended Saint-Venant model used as a mathematical tool to simulate the water flow from laboratory up to large-scale spatial domains applying physically-based principles of fluid mechanics. Many in-situ observations have shown that vegetation plays a key role in controlling the hydrological flux at catchment scale. In case of heavy rains, the infiltration and interception processes cease quickly, the remaining rainfall gives rise to the Hortonian overland flow and the flash flood is thus initiated. In this context, we also address the following problem: how do the gradient of soil surface and the vegetation influence the water dynamics in the Hortonian flow? The mathematical model and ASTERIX were kept as simple as possible in order to be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders interested in understanding the complex processes behind the water flow on hillslopes covered by plants.</description>

      <title>Morphing the left atrium geometry: The role of the pulmonary veins on flow patterns and thrombus formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Despite the significant advances made in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the left atrium (LA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions, the connection between atrial structure, flow dynamics, and blood stagnation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. Deepening our understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as the thrombi formed within the LAA are one of the main causes of stroke.
  Aim: To highlight and better understand the fundamental role of the PV orientation in forming atrial flow patterns and systematically quantifying its effect on blood stasis within the LAA.
  Methods: Two patients with opposite atrial flow patterns were selected for the study. The atria were segmented and subsequently morphed to modify the pulmonary vein (PV) orientations in a highly controlled manner. CFD analysis were performed using a kinematic model able to reproduce AF conditions. Results were projected into the universal left atrial appendage coordinate (ULAAC) system to enhance data visualization and comparison.
  Results: The position of the main atrial vortex can be modified by controlled changes in the PV orientations, which to the best of our knowledge was not demonstrated before. This finding may have important clinical implications, as the behavior and position of the main atrial vortex is crucial to define the LA flow patterns and thus the LAA washing, making possible to assess the stroke risk for a particular patient.</description>

      <title>MeshMask: Physics-Based Simulations with Masked Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</description>
