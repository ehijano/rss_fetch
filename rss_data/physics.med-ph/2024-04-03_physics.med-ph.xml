      <title>Prior Frequency Guided Diffusion Model for Limited Angle (LA)-CBCT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in image-guided radiotherapy. Reconstructing CBCTs from limited-angle acquisitions (LA-CBCT) is highly desired for improved imaging efficiency, dose reduction, and better mechanical clearance. LA-CBCT reconstruction, however, suffers from severe under-sampling artifacts, making it a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Diffusion models can generate data/images by reversing a data-noising process through learned data distributions; and can be incorporated as a denoiser/regularizer in LA-CBCT reconstruction. In this study, we developed a diffusion model-based framework, prior frequency-guided diffusion model (PFGDM), for robust and structure-preserving LA-CBCT reconstruction. PFGDM uses a conditioned diffusion model as a regularizer for LA-CBCT reconstruction, and the condition is based on high-frequency information extracted from patient-specific prior CT scans which provides a strong anatomical prior for LA-CBCT reconstruction. Specifically, we developed two variants of PFGDM (PFGDM-A and PFGDM-B) with different conditioning schemes. PFGDM-A applies the high-frequency CT information condition until a pre-optimized iteration step, and drops it afterwards to enable both similar and differing CT/CBCT anatomies to be reconstructed. PFGDM-B, on the other hand, continuously applies the prior CT information condition in every reconstruction step, while with a decaying mechanism, to gradually phase out the reconstruction guidance from the prior CT scans. The two variants of PFGDM were tested and compared with current available LA-CBCT reconstruction solutions, via metrics including PSNR and SSIM. PFGDM outperformed all traditional and diffusion model-based methods. PFGDM reconstructs high-quality LA-CBCTs under very-limited gantry angles, allowing faster and more flexible CBCT scans with dose reductions.</description>

      <title>A multicore parallel algorithm for multiscale modelling of an entire human blood circulation network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented multi-scale, closed-loop blood circulation model includes arterial, venous, and portal venous systems, heart-pulmonary circulation, and micro-circulation in capillaries. One-dimensional models simulate large blood vessel flow, whereas zerodimensional models are used for simulating blood flow in vascular subsystems corresponding to peripheral arteries and organs. Transmission conditions at bifurcation and confluence are solved using Riemann invariants. Blood circulation simulation in the portal venous system and related organs (liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, intestine) is particularly targeted. Those organs play important roles in metabolic system dynamics. The proposed efficient parallel algorithms for multicore environments solve these equations much faster than serial computations.</description>

      <title>Multiparametric quantification and visualization of liver fat using ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives- Several ultrasound measures have shown promise for assessment of steatosis compared to traditional B-scan, however clinicians may be required to integrate information across the parameters. Here, we propose an integrated multiparametric approach, enabling simple clinical assessment of key information from combined ultrasound parameters. Methods- We have measured 13 parameters related to ultrasound and shear wave elastography. These were measured in 30 human subjects under a study of liver fat. The 13 individual measures are assessed for their predictive value using independent magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) measurements as a reference standard. In addition, a comprehensive and fine-grain analysis is made of all possible combinations of sub-sets of these parameters to determine if any subset can be efficiently combined to predict fat fraction. Results- We found that as few as four key parameters related to ultrasound propagation are sufficient to generate a linear multiparametric parameter with a correlation against MRI-PDFF values of greater than 0.93. This optimal combination was found to have a classification area under the curve (AUC) approaching 1.0 when applying a threshold for separating steatosis grade zero from higher classes. Furthermore, a strategy is developed for applying local estimates of fat content as a color overlay to produce a visual impression of the extent and distribution of fat within the liver. Conclusion- In principle, this approach can be applied to most clinical ultrasound systems to provide the clinician and patient with a rapid and inexpensive estimate of liver fat content.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering suppression for in vivo optical coherence tomography measurement using B-scan-wise multi-focus averaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained quantitative magnetization transfer imaging: disentangling T1 of the free and semi-solid spin pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the inception of magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, it has been widely assumed that Henkelman's two spin pools have similar longitudinal relaxation times, which motivated many researchers to constrain them to each other. However, several recent publications reported a $T_1^s$ of the semi-solid spin pool that is much shorter than $T_1^f$ of the free pool. While these studies tailored experiments for robust proofs-of-concept, we here aim to quantify the disentangled relaxation processes on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e., with an effective resolution of 1.24mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an unconstrained MT model. We scanned four people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and four healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated $T_1^f \approx 1.84$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.34$s in healthy white matter. Our results confirm the reports that $T_1^s \ll T_1^f$ and we argue that this finding identifies MT as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in brain tissue. Moreover, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s \approx 0.212$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$ in normal-appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences between individuals with MS and controls.</description>
