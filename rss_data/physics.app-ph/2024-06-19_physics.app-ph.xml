      <title>A superconducting full-wave bridge rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting thin-film electronics are attractive for their low power consumption, fast operating speeds, and ease of interface with cryogenic systems such as single-photon detector arrays, and quantum computing devices. However, the lack of a reliable superconducting two-terminal asymmetric device, analogous to a semiconducting diode, limits the development of power-handling circuits, fundamental for scaling up these technologies. Existing efforts to date have been limited to single-diode proofs of principle and lacked integration of multiple controllable and reproducible devices to form complex circuits. Here, we demonstrate a robust superconducting diode with tunable polarity using the asymmetric Bean-Livingston surface barrier in niobium nitride micro-bridges, achieving a 43\,\% rectification efficiency. We then realize and integrate several such diodes into a bridge rectifier circuit on a single microchip that performs continuous full-wave rectification up to 3\,MHz and AC-to-DC conversion in burst mode at 50\,MHz with an estimated peak power efficiency of 60\,\%.</description>

      <title>Ultrasmall CsPbBr3 Blue Emissive Perovskite Quantum Dots using K-alloyed Cs4PbBr6 Nanocrystals as Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a colloidal synthesis of blue emissive, stable cube-shaped CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) in the strong quantum confinement regime via a dissolution-recrystallization starting from pre-synthesized (KxCs1-x)4PbBr6 nanocrystals which are then reacted with PbBr2. This is markedly different from the known case of Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals that react within seconds with PbBr2 and get transformed into much larger, green emitting CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Here, instead, the conversion of (KxCs1-x)4PbBr6 nanocrystals to CsPbBr3 QDs occurs in a time span of hours, and tuning of the QDs size is achieved by adjusting the concentration of precursors. The QDs exhibit excitonic features in optical absorption that are tunable in the 420 - 452 nm range, accompanied by blue photoluminescence with quantum yield around 60%. Detailed spectroscopic investigations in both the single and multi-exciton regime reveal the exciton fine structure and the effect of Auger recombination of these CsPbBr3 QDs, confirming theoretical predictions for this system.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear photocurrent in quantum materials for broadband photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the vast potential of optical sensing technology has long been hindered by the challenges of achieving fast, sensitive, and broadband photodetection at ambient temperatures. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the study of nonlinear photocurrent in topological quantum materials, and its application in broadband photodetection without the use of p-n junction based semiconductor diodes. The intrinsic quadratic transverse current-input voltage relation is used to rectify the alternating electric field from incident radio, terahertz or infrared waves into a direct current, without a bias voltage and at zero magnetic field. We review novel photocurrents in several material systems, including topological Weyl semimetals, chiral crystals, ferroelectric materials, and low dimensional topological insulators. These quantum materials hold tremendous promise for broadband high-frequency rectification and photodetection, featuring substantial responsivity and detectivity.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of particle-laden interfaces: geometric and preparation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of uni-axially compressed particle rafts through a finite opening found at the opposite side is experimentally studied. Three main behaviours are identified. The lowest relaxation degree corresponds to local unjamming. The other extreme corresponds to full relaxation and is characterized by the unjamming of the entire raft. In between, intermediate relaxation is observed. The unjammed domain first grows along the compression direction with an almost constant width and possibly extends through the entire raft length. In this case, a second phase may start during which erosion enables the unjammed channel to develop normally to the compression direction. Employing different raft geometries, i.e. various length and compression levels, and openings of various widths, we rationalize the occurrence of these different behaviours, which we attribute to the mechanical robustness of the force chain network. The threshold for channel formation and erosion are interpreted as its rupture against excessive shear and elongation, respectively. By further comparing results obtained for rafts prepared according to three different mixing degrees, we evidence that these thresholds are strongly affected by the raft history and quantify these effects in terms of shift of the rupture limits.</description>

      <title>4D Printing of Programmable Digital Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern 3D printers allow for the accurate placing of microscopic material voxels, to form complex three-dimensional structures. The advancing capabilities in multi-material printing, coupled with the discovery of printable responsive materials, pave the way for the 3D printing of digital materials, and for the 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. In this work, we leverage and combine these advancements to develop a versatile methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print digital responsive sheets, composed of active and passive voxels that are meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. This methodology enables us to encode the lateral geometry and the reference curvature, separately and simultaneously. Our approach grants us comprehensive control over the resulting shape, unlocking novel opportunities in synthetic shape-morphing materials. Furthermore, it has the potential to program anomalous mechanical properties and to be extended to multi-material and metamaterial systems.</description>

      <title>An integrated electro-optically tunable multi-channel interference cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated a continuously tunable laser system by butt coupling a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) chip with a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) based multi-channel interference (MCI) cavity chip. This hybrid integrated lasers allows for fine-tuning of the laser wavelength from 1538 nm to 1560 nm with a resolution of 0.014 nm and a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) exceeding 30 dB. The MCI cavity chip is fabricated using the photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique. The developed laser has an output power of approximately 10 {\mu}W, which can be further amplified to 70 mW using a commercial erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) without significant broadening of the laser linewidth.</description>

      <title>Structured Detection for Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Optical Sectioning in Laser Scanning Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and sensitive detector arrays enable image scanning microscopy (ISM), overcoming the trade-off between spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) typical of confocal microscopy. However, current ISM approaches cannot provide optical sectioning and fail with thick samples, unless the size of the detector is limited. Thus, another trade-off between optical sectioning and SNR persists. Here, we propose a method without drawbacks that combines uncompromised super-resolution, high SNR, and optical sectioning. Furthermore, our approach enables super-sampling of images, relaxing Nyquist's criterion by a factor of two. Based on the observation that imaging with a detector array inherently embeds axial information about the sample, we designed a straightforward reconstruction algorithm that inverts the physical model of ISM. We present the comprehensive theoretical framework and validate our method with synthetic and experimental images of biological samples captured using a custom setup equipped with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach exciting fluorescence emission both in the linear and non-linear regime. Moreover, we generalize the algorithm for fluorescence lifetime imaging, fully exploiting the single-photon timing ability of the SPAD array detector. Our method outperforms conventional approaches to ISM and can be extended to any LSM technique.</description>

      <title>Mechanism to transfer linear momentum from a Surface Acoustic Wave to a Magnetic Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used frequently in spintronic applications, mostly to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to move magnetic domain walls (DW). Because the SAW cannot achieve magnetic switching without the assistance of a magnetic field or a current, for a marginal improvement in the energy required for the magnetic switching, the device gains in complexity, making it impractical. In this work, we report a mechanism that allows a transfer of linear momentum from the acoustic wave to the magnetic domain wall. Experimentally we show that, using the appropriate dimensions of the magnetic strip, the SAW can move the DW in the same direction as the traveling SAW. With the help of micromagnetic simulations, we reveal a complex yet direct mechanism that allows the SAW to push the DW in the same direction of its travel, even without any external field or currents. The DW can reach velocities in the range of 100 m/s and at a very small energetic cost, equivalent to using a current density of $\sim 5 \cdot 10^4 A/cm^2$ if the movement was triggered by spin transfer. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of single-layer vanadium diselenide on Au(111) with distinguished electronic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein, we report the reversible structural transition of single-layer VSe2 grown on Au(111) through alternating thermal annealing and Se replenishment. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of high-quality VSe2 on Au(111) with the octahedral (1T) structure and the Se-vacancy-induced transformation of VSe2 from the metallic moir\'e (1T) phase to the semiconducting (2H) phase. With convincing agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, the nanostructure near the grain boundary in the defective intermediate phase is confirmed, as well as the reaction pathway with Se gradually depleting at elevated temperatures. Importantly, it is revealed that the density of the linear Se defects plays a crucial role in the formation of the 2H domain phase due to the increment of the in-plane lattice parameter after Se desorption and the better thermal stability of the 2H phase compared to the 1T phase. The proper control of the density of Se atoms in the topmost Se layer of VSe2 could feasibly manipulate the ratio between the 1T phase and the 2H phase in the steak-shaped domain, which is regarded as a good platform for 2D homojunctions in nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>
