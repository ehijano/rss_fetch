      <title>Dynamical analysis in a nonlocal delayed reaction-diffusion tumor model with therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamical properties of a reaction-diffusion system arising from tumor-therapy modelling that features both nonlinear interactions and nonlocal delay. By applying the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we establish the existence of a nontrivial steady-state solution bifurcating from the trivial solution. In particular, we derive an approximate expression for a spatially nonhomogeneous steady-state solution. Then, we provide a detailed spectral characterization of the linearized operator and explicit stability criteria and identify the delay-dependent Hopf bifurcation regimes. To illustrate the theoretical results, we include a concrete example that verifies the claims in our theorems and numerically demonstrates how changes in treatment parameters alter stability and bifurcation behaviour.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound for Permanent Saturation of Metric Graphs using Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine upper bounds on the permanent saturation time of metric graphs using interval exchange transformations (IETs). Earlier results gave bounds under incommensurable edge lengths, we improve and generalize them by using the ergodic and minimal properties of IETs. By associating an IET to a metric graph, we show that the induced interval dynamics are ergodic and minimal, which ensures uniform coverage over time. Our main theorem gives a sharper upper bound for the saturation time in terms of edge lengths and structural constants of the graph. We also define the Lyapunov spectrum of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for these maps and relate it to the system's dynamics. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations on specific graph configurations, such as the complete graph $K_4$ and star graphs, confirming the accuracy of our estimates. These results strengthen existing estimates and provide tools for studying connectivity at the interface of graph theory and dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we talk about what is known as Invariance Principle in dynamical systems. It states that the disintegration of measures with zero center Lyapunov exponents admits some extra invariance by holonomies. We focus on explaining the basic definitions and ideas behind a series of results about the Invariance Principle and give some basic applications on how this is used in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Local stability and rates of convergence to equilibrium for the Nonlinear Renewal Equation; applications to Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of the solutions of a nonlinear renewal equation. The main contribution of the present article is to provide stability and convergence results around equilibrium solutions, under some local subcritical condition. Quantitative rates of convergence to equilibrium are established. Instability results are given in both the critical and supercritical cases. As an implication of these results, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for Hawkes processes in a mean-field interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Logistic Functions as Robust Alternatives to Hill Functions in Genetic Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks exhibit sigmoidal dynamics traditionally modeled using Hill functions. When Hill coefficients are non-integer values--ubiquitous in experimental fitting--these functions lose differentiability at low expression, creating singularities that compromise numerical stability and impede control applications. We present a systematic framework replacing Hill functions with logistic functions: increasing for activation, decreasing for repression. Logistic functions preserve sigmoidal characteristics while offering key advantages: infinite differentiability, closed-form derivatives simplifying Jacobians, invertible forms enabling feedback linearization, and built-in basal expression. We prove existence and uniqueness with explicit Lipschitz bounds, guaranteeing unique solutions and boundedness. Parameter estimation with biologically motivated thresholds demonstrated in case studies: genetic oscillators, positive autoregulation in E. coli, two-gene chaotic networks. Simulations with experimental parameters show: logistic models allow noise escape from low-expression traps via basal, while Hill models trap irreversibly--relevant to gal operon and bistables. Logistic functions respond to absolute concentrations rather than logarithmic fold changes, aligning with molecule count-based decisions. Control advantages: controllability at zero (missing in Hill), seamless MPC integration, superior stability. Logit extensions enable network inference from scRNA-seq data, using concavity for convergence and handling dropouts. Applications: immunology, hematopoiesis with delays, environmental systems. The framework advances modeling for synthetic biology, therapeutic interventions, metabolic engineering, and genome-scale analysis.</description>

      <title>On subsets of integers having dense orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\subset \mathbb{N}$. We say $A$ is an $R$-sequence for a given minimal system $(Y,S)$ if there is $y\in Y$ such that $\{S^ny:n\in A\}$ is dense in $Y$. Richter asked if $A$ is an $R$-sequence for all minimal equicontinuous systems implies that $A$ is an $R$-sequence for all minimal systems. In this paper, we investigate this question and related issues within the framework of totally minimal systems, including a characterization of transitive systems that are disjoint from all totally minimal systems.
  A dynamical system is scattering (resp. weakly scattering) if its product with any minimal (resp. minimal and equicontinuous) system is transitive. It turns out that $(X,T)$ is scattering if and only if for any transitive point $x\in X$ and any minimal system $(Y,S)$ there is $y\in Y$ such that the orbit of $(x,y)$ is dense in $X\times Y$ if and only if for each transitive point $x\in X$ and any non-empty open subset $U$ of $X$, $\{n\in \mathbb{N}:T^nx\in U\}$ is an $R$-sequence. By combining this result with earlier work of Huang and Ye, we deduce that if scattering and weak scattering are distinct properties, then both Richter's question and Katznelson's question admit negative answers.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. This leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>Measured inverse semigroups and their actions on von Neumann algebras and equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known to experts that certain regular inclusions of von Neumann algebras arise as crossed products with cocycle actions of the canonical quotient groupoids associated with the inclusions. Similarly, `strongly normal' inclusions of standard equivalence relations arise as semi-direct products with cocycle actions of the quotient groupoids. However, to the author's knowledge, rigorous proofs of these results in full generality are absent in the literature. In this article, we exploit the usual correspondence between inverse semigroups and groupoids, and give a unified approach to proving these `folklore' results and fill this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Information Geometric Regularization of the Compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) was the first inviscid regularization of the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations, which enabled the simulation of realistic compressible fluid models at an unprecedented scale. However, the thermodynamic effects of this regularization have not yet been understood in a principled manner. To achieve a proper understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of the IGR, we decompose the regularization into its conservative dynamics, framed as a Hamiltonian subsystem, and its dissipative dynamics. In so doing, we further introduce two more models to compare to IGR, the Hamiltonian regularized Euler (HRE) model, which is the first multi-dimensional, non-dispersive Hamiltonian regularization of the compressible Euler equations with energy, as well as the Hamiltonian IGR (HIGR) model, which modifies the dissipation used in the IGR model to instead utilize a metriplectic dissipative force. Despite having many attractive features, the HRE and HIGR models exhibit notable defects in numerical tests on colliding shock problems, which preclude their use as computational tools without further study of dissipative weak solutions to these models. Additionally, our analysis presents new results on the IGR model itself, including its ability to conserve acoustic waves, as well as local energy transport laws and entropy production rates. By separating the conservative and dissipative dynamics of the IGR, our hope is that subsequent of analysis of the IGR model can benefit from this natural decomposition, such as, for example, rigorous proofs of strong solutions for multi-dimensional IGR for the compressible Euler system with thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show the map $\sigma : T_g \to C_g$ sending a compact hyperbolic surface $X$ to a random simple closed geodesic on $X$ determines a proper embedding of Teichm\"uller space into the space of geodesic currents. The proof depends on a formula for the intersection number $i(C,C')$ of a pair of multicurves, expressed in terms of Dehn coordinates on $ML_g(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Dimension theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation with matrix sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hausdorff dimension of naturally occurring sets of inhomogeneous well-approximable points with a sequence of real invertible matrices $\mathcal{A}=(A_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. Specifically, for a given point $\mathbf{y}\in [0,1)^d$ and a function $\psi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^+$, we study the limsup set \[ W\big(\mathcal{A},\psi,{\bf y}\big)
  =\Big\{\mathbf{x}\in [0,1)^d\colon A_n\mathbf{x}~(\bmod~1)\in B\big(\mathbf{y}, \psi(n)\big) {\rm ~ for~ infinitely ~many}~n\in\mathbb{N}\Big\}.\] The upper and lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},\psi,{\bf y}\big)$ are determined by involving the singular values of $A_n$ and the successive minima of the lattice $A_n^{-1}\mathbb{Z}^d$, and both bounds are shown to be attainable for some matrices. Within this framework, we unify the problem of shrinking target sets and recurrence sets, establishing the Hausdorff dimensions for such limsup sets. As applications, our corresponding upper bounds for shrinking target and recurrence sets essentially improve those appearing in the present literature. Furthermore, explicit Hausdorff dimension formulas are derived for shrinking targets and recurrence sets associated with concrete classes of matrices.
  We extend the Mass Transference Principle for rectangles of Li-Liao-Velani-Wang-Zorin (Adv. Math., 2025) to rectangles under local isometries. This generalization yields a general lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $W\big(\mathcal{A},\psi,{\bf y}\big)$.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Learning for Dynamical Systems with Theoretical Score Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real world systems evolve in continuous-time according to their underlying causal relationships, yet their dynamics are often unknown. Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>P-Bifurcations in Stochastic Flutter Model Under Common Gust Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aeroelastic flutter represents a critical nonlinear instability in flight dynamics, where the coupling between structural elasticity and unsteady aerodynamics leads to self-excited oscillations. In deterministic settings, the onset of flutter is typically characterized by bifurcations of invariant sets such as equilibria or limit cycles. However, real flight conditions are inherently stochastic due to atmospheric turbulence, rendering trajectory-based attractors insufficient for describing long-time behavior and motivating a probabilistic viewpoint. The stochastic nature of turbulence modifies these transitions, often generating high-dimensional stationary distributions which are difficult to visualize. In this work, we use a topological framework to detect and characterize such stochastic bifurcations in a two-degree-of-freedom aerofoil model with nonlinear stiffness. Reconstructing the full phase-space kernel density estimate (KDE) and constructing homological bifurcation plots reveal high-dimensional toroidal structures in the stationary probability density that are otherwise difficult to detect from two-dimensional projections. Further, we perform a comparative analysis of flutter under the influence of three classes of gust models: sinusoidal white Gaussian noise, the Dryden turbulence model, and the Von Karman turbulence model. Our analysis bypasses the predominantly used visual inspection in stochastic bifurcation studies, enabling systematic and automated exploration of stochastic flutter across large parameter ranges.</description>

Abstract: In this article we construct the first examples of strongly aperiodic linearly repetitive Delone sets in non-abelian Lie groups by means of symbolic substitutions. In particular, we find such sets in all $2$-step nilpotent Lie groups with rational structure constants such as the Heisenberg group. More generally, we consider the class of $1$-connected nilpotent Lie groups whose Lie algebras admit a rational form and a derivation with positive eigenvalues. Any group in this class admits a lattice which is invariant under a natural family of dilations, and this allows us to construct primitive non-periodic symbolic substitutions. We show that, as in the abelian case, the associated subshift (and hence the induced Delone dynamical system) is minimal, uniquely ergodic and weakly aperiodic and consists of linearly repetitive configurations. In the $2$-step nilpotent case, it is even strongly aperiodic.</description>

      <title>On elementary integrability of rational vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider complex rational vector fields that admit a first integral whose logarithmic derivative lies in a finite extension of the rational function field $K$. In view of the Prelle-Singer theorem, these are the rational vector fields that admit an elementary first integral. Elementary integrable vector fields which are not Darboux integrable -- thus the extension field is necessarily a proper extension of $K$ -- may be called exceptional by an observation in an earlier paper by Christopher et al. For dimension two we characterize all possible algebraic extension fields underlying the exceptional cases, provide a construction of all exceptional vector fields, and obtain some criteria that restrict the degree of $L$.</description>

      <title>$\K$-Lorentzian and $\K$-CLC Polynomials in Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials, a generalization of the distinguished class of Lorentzian polynomials. As shown in \cite{GPlorentzian}, the set of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials is equivalent to the set of $\K$-completely log-concave (aka $\K$-CLC) forms. Throughout this paper, we interchangeably use the terms $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials for the homogeneous setting and $\K$-CLC polynomials for the non-homogeneous setting. By introducing an alternative definition of $\K$-CLC polynomials through univariate restrictions, we establish that any strictly $\K$-CLC polynomial of degree $d \leq 4$ is Hurwitz-stable polynomial over $\K$. Additionally, we characterize the conditions under which a strictly $\K$-CLC of degree $d \geq 5$ is Hurwitz-stable over $\K$. Furthermore, we associate the largest possible proper cone, denoted by $\K(f,v)$, with a given $\K$-Lorentzian polynomial $f$ in the direction $v \in \inter \K$. Finally, we investigate applications of $\K$-CLC polynomials in the stability analysis of evolution variational inequalities (EVI) dynamical systems governed by differential equations and inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Multifractal formalism of Lyapunov exponents for fiber-bunched linear cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a higher-dimensional extension of multifractal analysis for typical fiber-bunched linear cocycles. Our main result is a relative variational principle, which shows that the topological entropy of Lyapunov exponent level sets can be approximated by the metric entropy of ergodic measures fully concentrated on those level sets, addressing a question posed by Breuillard and Sert. We also establish a variational principle for the generalized singular value function. As an application to dynamically defined linear cocycles, we obtain a multifractal formalism for open sets of $C^{1+\alpha}$ repellers and Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Height arguments toward the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem.
  (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov multiplier of any iteration is not an integer.
  (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism, where $f$ and $g$ are surjective endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a projective curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$.
  Using the second result, we deal with the case of split self-maps of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct.
  In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagined -- even for endomorphisms of tori with zero entropy. One may compare them with the conjectures and results stated in [CGSZ21] and [XY25].</description>

      <title>Rigorously Characterizing Dynamics with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of dynamics from time series data is a problem of general interest. It is well established that dynamics on the level of invariant sets, the primary objects of interest in the classical theory of dynamical systems, is not computable. We recall a coarser characterization of dynamics based on order theory and algebraic topology and prove that this characterization can be identified using approximations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Identification of Attractors Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore challenges in developing a topological framework in which machine learning can be used to robustly characterize global dynamics. Specifically, we focus on learning a useful discretization of the phase space of a flow on compact, hyperrectangle in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from a neural network trained on labeled orbit data. A characterization of the structure of the global dynamics is obtained from approximations of attracting neighborhoods provided by the phase space discretization. The perspective that motivates this work is based on Conley's topological approach to dynamics, which provides a means to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>On averages of completely multiplicative functions over co-prime integer pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied the asymptotic behavior of the averages of completely multiplicative functions over the Gaussian integers. They derived Wirsing's theorem for Gaussian integers, answered a question of Frantzikinakis and Host for sum of two squares, and obtained a variant of a theorem of Bergelson and Richter on ergodic averages along the number of prime factors of integers. In this paper, we will show the analogue of these results for co-prime integer pairs. Moreover, building on Frantzikinakis and Host's results, we obtain some convergences on the multilinear averages of multiplicative functions over primitive lattice points.</description>

      <title>Operator Splitting Methods for Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator-splitting schemes for approximating Koopman generators of linear semigroups induced by nonlinear flows, a framework originating with Dorroh and Neuberger. Building on ideas of Lie, Kowalewski, and Gr\"{o}bner, we analyze the Koopman semigroup generated by the Lie-Koopman operator and exploit decompositions of this operator into finitely many components to construct Lie-Trotter, Strang, and higher-order compositions with explicit error bounds. A bi-continuous Chernoff extension guarantees well-posedness and contraction of the splitting operators. Numerical experiments on Lotka-Volterra, Van der Pol, and Lorenz systems validate the theory and demonstrate efficiency via work-precision comparisons. The algorithms remain conceptually simple, relying on coordinate freezing combined with one-dimensional solves, which reflects the classical separation-of-variables principle.</description>

      <title>Equitability and explosive synchronisation in multiplex and higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster synchronisation is a key phenomenon observed in networks of coupled dynamical units. Its presence has been linked to symmetry and, more generally, to equability of the underlying pattern of interactions between dynamical units. However, it is not known under which conditions equitability-induced synchronisation is the only cluster synchronisation that can occur on a particular system. Here, we reveal a natural linear independent condition such that equitability becomes necessary, and sufficient, for the existence of cluster synchronised solutions on a very general dynamical system which allows multiplex or higher-order, arbitrarily weighted interactions. Our results explain the ubiquity of explosive synchronisation, as opposed to cluster synchronisation, in multiplex and higher-order networks: equitability imposes additional constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied on the same set of nodes. Our results have significant implications for the design of complex dynamical systems of coupled dynamical units with arbitrary cluster synchronisation patterns and coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent avoids strict saddles with a simple line-search method too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that gradient descent (GD) on a $C^2$ cost function generically avoids strict saddle points when using a small, constant step size. However, no such guarantee existed for GD with a line-search method. We provide one for a modified version of the standard Armijo backtracking method with generic, arbitrarily large initial step size. The proof underlines the double role of the Luzin $N^{-1}$ property for the iteration maps, and allows to forgo the habitual Lipschitz gradient assumption.
  We extend this to the Riemannian setting (RGD), assuming the retraction is real analytic (though the cost function still only needs to be $C^2$). In closing, we also improve guarantees for RGD with a constant step size in some scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a novel sufficient (non-Gaussian) ergodic interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\mathsf{AR}(p)$ and $\mathsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means. The utility of our results in particular for the Sliced Wasserstein distance are confirmed by multivariate numerical experiments.</description>
