      <title>How does liquidity shape the yield curve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenology of the forward rate curve (FRC) can be accurately understood by the fluctuations of a stiff elastic string (Le Coz and Bouchaud, 2024). By relating the exogenous shocks driving such fluctuations to the surprises in the order flows, we elevate the model from purely describing price variations to a microstructural model that incorporates the joint dynamics of prices and order flows, accounting for both impact and cross-impact effects. Remarkably, this framework allows for at least the same explanatory power as existing cross-impact models, while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our model generates liquidity-dependent correlations between the forward rate of one tenor and the order flow of another, consistent with recent empirical findings. We show that the model also account for the non-martingale behavior of prices at short timescales.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Liquidity with Leverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrated liquidity (CL) provisioning is a way how to improve the capital efficiency of Automated Market Makers (AMM). Allowing liquidity providers to use leverage is a step towards even higher capital efficiency. A number of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols implement this technique in conjunction with overcollateralized lending. However, the properties of leveraged CL positions have not been formalized and are poorly understood in practice. This article describes the principles of a leveraged CL provisioning protocol, formally models the notions of margin level, assets, and debt, and proves that within this model, leveraged LP positions possess several properties that make them safe to use.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Market Model Can Explain the Impact of AI Traders in Financial Markets -- A New Microfoundations of GARCH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in their effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising important questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest, a comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI traders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling the influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a multi-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations. Microfoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market price formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual economic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational approaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like the GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as volatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market model to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three types of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By mathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish the microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through multi-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts of financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using parameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper understanding of their role in market dynamics.</description>
