      <title>Rotation catalyzed chiral magnetovortical instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a background rotation significantly catalyzes the chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral magnetohydrodynamics. The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas.</description>

      <title>Generalized gauge-space rotations in atomic nuclei: A critical insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically reexamine the concepts of pairing rotations and moments of inertia in gauge space extracted from experimental binding energies. Our analysis focuses on pairing correlations among like nucleons, neutron-proton pairing, and $\alpha$-type correlations. By investigating $\alpha$ separation energies and binding-energy differences along chains of fixed isospin projection and subtracting macroscopic contributions, we reveal a remarkably smooth and nearly universal behavior in the residual $\alpha$ correlation energy. These results exhibit the parabolic trends characteristic of collective rotations in gauge space. We demonstrate that the standard definition of the gauge-space moment of inertia for like-nucleon pairing is dominated by macroscopic contributions from Coulomb and symmetry energies. Once these are removed, the remaining moment of inertia becomes negative. This suggests that the observed behavior reflects the loss of correlation energy due to Pauli-blocking effect. Our results indicate that $\alpha$ correlations constitute a genuine collective mode associated with quartetting dynamics arising from the coherent coupling of two superfluid components.</description>

      <title>Partial conservation of seniority in semi-magic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of seniority plays a central role in nuclear structure physics by classifying many-body states according to the number of unpaired nucleons. While exact seniority conservation holds in single-$j$ systems with $j \leq 7/2$, deviations arise for higher-$j$ orbitals where residual interactions can mix states of different seniority. Surprisingly, certain states in systems with $j \geq 9/2$ exhibit partial conservation of seniority, remaining solvable even when the symmetry is expected to break. This paper reviews the theoretical foundation of the seniority scheme, its connection to pairing interactions and coefficients of fractional parentage, and the conditions under which solvability persists. Particular emphasis is placed on the $j=9/2$ case, where two $v=4$ states with $I=4$ and $I=6$ remain unmixed under arbitrary interactions. We discuss analytical proofs of their existence, numerical studies, and supporting experimental evidence from semi-magic nuclei across five regions of the nuclear chart. Extensions to symbolic shell-model approaches are also presented, highlighting their utility in exploring wave functions and symmetries in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Producing $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in $\pi^-p$ reaction to explore their inner structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the production mechanisms of the hyperon resonances $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in the $\pi^- p$ scattering are investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach incorporating Regge trajectories. By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $\Sigma$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1405)$ and $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $\Lambda(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $\Lambda(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $\Lambda(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $\Lambda(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $\Lambda^* \to \pi \Sigma$, the Dalitz process $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K \Lambda^{*} \rightarrow K \pi \Sigma$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $\Lambda^*$ via the $K\pi\Sigma$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Two-Pion Exchange Contributions to the Nucleon-Nucleon Interaction from the Roper Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the long-range components of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) two-pion-exchange potential with an intermediate Roper resonance. Leading-order interactions in heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory are considered. NN phase shifts with orbital angular momentum $L\geq 2$ are calculated in first-order perturbation theory and compared to those obtained without the Roper resonance. We show that the Roper contribution is sizeable for $D$ waves and improves the description of phase shifts for all the partial waves slightly. We also discuss the role of the Roper resonance in the NN interaction in the framework of resonance saturation.</description>

      <title>Medium effects on light clusters from heavy-ion collisions within a relativistic mean-field description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central $^{136,124}$Xe$+^{124,112}$Sn collisions from INDRA data are analysed using a Bayesian inference on light nuclei multiplicities to estimate the thermodynamical parameters and in-medium modification of the cluster self-energies within a relativistic mean-field model. An excellent description of experimentally measured abundances of H and He isotopes is obtained. We examine two possible modelling of in-medium effects as an increased in-medium effective mass, or an increased vector repulsion. We show that these physical pictures cannot be discriminated by the data. In both cases, the temperature dependence of the meson couplings leads to a faster weakening of the light cluster abundances with temperature than previous studies predicted. Possible systematic errors due to out-of-equilibrium effects affecting the experimental abundances, are considered by repeating the Bayesian inference with reduced information. The abundance prediction of the species excluded from the constraint is well compatible with the experimental data, suggesting that there is no a priori need of accounting for non-equilibrium effects or finite state interactions that potentially affect the deuteron yield.</description>

      <title>Addressing the ground state of the deuteron by physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in addressing the structure of atomic nuclei. Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a promising machine learning technique suitable for solving integro-differential problems such as the many-body Schr\"odinger problem. So far, there has been no demonstration of extracting nuclear eigenstates using such method. Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$. Our approach paves the way for the exploitation of PINNs to solve more complex atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Pion $\beta$ decay and $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ beyond leading logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements is crucial for precise predictions of weak processes involving hadrons. In this Letter, we address this point for charged-current processes involving two pions -- pion $\beta$ decay $\pi^\pm\to\pi^0 e^\pm\nu_e$ and hadronic $\tau$ decays $\tau^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^0\nu_\tau$ -- whose decay rates depend on the so-called $\gamma W$ box correction. Using recent results from lattice QCD, we show how to formulate the matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, in particular, how to cancel the dependence on the scheme choice for evanescent operators. As main results, we obtain a prediction for the decay rate of pion $\beta$ decay with theory uncertainties improved by a factor of three, which renders theory uncertainties negligible for future determinations of $V_{ud}$ even beyond the reach of the PIONEER experiment, and an evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ with negligible uncertainty from the short-distance matching, as necessary for a future $\tau$-based determination of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Parton Distribution Functions from Boosted Correlations in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\pi=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.</description>

      <title>A study of charged-particle multiplicity distribution in high energy p-O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the multiplicity distribution of charged particles generated in $p$-O collisions, employing Pythia (Angantyr) and $k_T$-factorization approach. Oxygen nucleus configurations are sampled using a $\alpha$-cluster model to evaluate both formalisms and assess how initial nucleus configuration influences the properties of the produced final states. Results obtained through clustering are systematically compared to those derived from the Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution. The analysis encompasses various pseudorapidity intervals ($|\eta|&lt;$ 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) and center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}=$ 2.36, 5.02, 7.0, 13.0 TeV). Based on the resulting distributions, we examine the KNO scaling effect and fit the distributions with the double NBD model for parameterization, aiming to accurately characterize the observed results and elucidate contributions from both soft and semi-hard processes. Our results indicate that different geometric descriptions of the oxygen nucleus project significantly different multiplicities of charged particles, especially for large multiplicities and higher pseudorapidity. We also observed that multiplicity of charged particles calculated with Pythia reveals significantly different behavior from that calculated with $k_T$-factorization.</description>

      <title>QCD matter at a finite magnetic field and nonzero chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid equation of state (EoS) by smoothly interpolating the EoS in the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures to that in the ideal parton gas at high temperatures, and employ it to study the properties of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter at a finite magnetic field and nonzero chemical potential. We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $\Delta = (\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in a magnetic field with baryon and isospin chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, we present the phase diagram of low-energy QCD in a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. The phase diagram consists of the QCD vacuum, the chiral soliton lattice, the uniform charged pion condensation, an Abrikosov vortex lattice of the charged pions, a baryonic vortex lattice composed of neutral and charged pion vortices with their topological linking number being the baryon number, and a hybrid phase of chiral soliton and vortex lattices, with their intersections carrying the baryon number. While the chiral soliton lattice demands ultra-strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{19}$ G,the intersection phase appears at $\sim10^{17}$ G, which is more realistic in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of strange and multi-strange hadrons in isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $K_{s}^{0}$, $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$, $\phi$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\overline{\Xi}^{+}$, and $\Omega^{-}$+$\overline{\Omega}^{+}$ at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt; 1.0$) for isobar, $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr, collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of $v_{2}$ is studied for various centrality classes. The number of constituent quark scaling of (multi-)strange hadrons is found to hold approximately within 20%, suggesting the development of partonic collectivity in isobar collisions similar to that observed in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The average $v_{2}$ ratio shows $\sim$2% deviation from unity in central and mid-central collisions for strange hadrons, indicating a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between the isobars. The $v_{2}$ in isobaric collisions is compared to Cu+Cu, Au+Au, and U+U collisions at similar collision energies. We observe an increase in $v_{2}(p_\mathrm{T})$ with increasing system size. The difference in $v_{2}$ between the isobar and other collision systems increases with $p_\mathrm{T}$. The results are compared with a multi-phase transport model calculations with a deformed density profile to provide further insight into the nuclear structure of these isobars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a tree-level calculation of the scattering amplitude for the $lp\to lp\gamma$ (with a hard photon) process within the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our calculations, based on the $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^3)$ nucleon-pion Lagrangians, aim to provide a theoretical prediction for the differential cross-section. The result shows that explicit inclusion of the nonzero lepton mass significantly influences the low energy differential cross section for $\mu p\to \mu p \gamma$ process. The kinematic region of the present experimental data is beyond the validity domain of the $\chi$PT and is therefore not suitable for determining the low-energy constants (LECs). By comparing our results with future experimental data, we expect to determine the values of the LECs as a further test of $\chi$PT as an effective low-energy theory of QCD. The process is of significant interest as it can help to determine the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Resonating group method for baryon-baryon interactions with unequal oscillator frequencies and its application to the $N\Delta$ system in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonating group method (RGM) is widely used to investigate baryon-baryon interactions at the quark level, typically under the assumption that the two baryons involved share an identical harmonic-oscillator frequency. In reality, however, when a specific interaction Hamiltonian is given, different baryons should have unequal oscillator frequencies due to distinct interaction potentials induced by their different quantum numbers. In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $N\Delta$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry. The distinctive features of the newly developed formalism are elucidated by comparing the results from the new formulation with those from traditional calculations.</description>

      <title>Second excited state of ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ tetramer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.</description>

      <title>Systematic Operator Construction for Non-relativistic Effective Field Theories: Hilbert Series versus Young Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a systematic framework for operator construction in the non-relativistic effective field theory, incorporating both the three dimensional Euclidean symmetry and the internal symmetries. By employing double cover of the rotation group, we extend the Hilbert series to the non-relativistic systems, and eliminates redundancies introduced by the spin operator. We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\mathcal{O}(v^4)$.</description>

      <title>Charm quark evolution in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quarks are predominantly generated at the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions such that heavy flavor observables have the potential to provide information on the pre-equilibrium medium dynamics. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ to early-time charm quark dynamics in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We employ the IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD framework to model the evolution of the bulk medium. Charm quarks are generated using PYTHIA with nuclear parton distribution functions and evolved using Langevin dynamics within MARTINI. We observe that even though there is significant momentum broadening in the earliest stage, D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are only weakly sensitive to pre-equilibrium interactions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear state and level densities of actinides with the shell-model Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Actinides are of great interest in astrophysics and technology applications since they can fission. However, the microscopic calculation of their statistical properties in the presence of correlations poses a major theoretical challenge. The configuration-interaction shell-model is a suitable framework to calculate these properties but the required large model spaces are beyond the reach of conventional diagonalization methods. The shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) method enables calculations in very large model spaces and was applied to nuclei as heavy as the lanthanides. Here, we extend the SMMC method to the actinides. Fifteen even-even and odd-mass actinides $^{232}$Th, $^{\textrm{234-239}}$U, $^{\textrm{240-243}}$Pu, $^{\textrm{246-248}}$Cm, and $^{250}$Cf are studied using a single-particle model space that is larger than one major shell each for protons and neutrons, with a total dimension of the many-particle space as large as $10^{32}$. We calculate nuclear state densities of these actinides and find they are strongly enhanced in comparison with mean-field densities. We use spin projection methods to calculate nuclear level densities and average $s$-wave neutron resonance spacings, both of which are found to be in good agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>Dense matter in a holographic hard-wall model of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deeper understanding of QCD matter at strong coupling remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature. To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Diffractive vector meson photo-production in oxygen--oxygen and neon--neon ultraperipheral collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy-dependent hotspot model is used to predict cross sections for vector-meson diffractive photo-nuclear production off oxygen ($\gamma$O) and neon ($\gamma$Ne) that can be extracted from ultra-peripheral O--O and Ne--Ne collisions, recently recorded at the LHC. In both cases, two models are used to describe the nuclear shapes. Woods-Saxon prescriptions for O and Ne as well as an alpha-cluster description of O and a bowling-pin-like shape for Ne, according to the PGCM formalism. Predictions are presented for the dependence on the centre-of-mass energy of the photon--nucleus system, as well as on Mandelstam-$t$, of the cross sections for the coherent and the incoherent photo-nuclear production of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ vector mesons. Furthermore, the rapidity dependence of the ultra-peripheral cross section is reported for all cases. It is found that the incoherent process provides a measurable signature for the approach to the gluon-saturation regime, and that the simultaneous determination of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ coherent and incoherent production provides a strong constraint on nuclear models for both O and Ne.</description>

      <title>Studies of beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV within a transport model approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy proton proton ($pp$) collisions at the LHC, non-prompt charm hadrons, originating from beauty hadron decays, provide a valuable probe for beauty quark dynamics, particularly at low transverse momentum where direct beauty measurements are challenging. We employ A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT) of string melting version coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions to study the beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this work, the beauty quark mass during the generation stage has been increased to reproduce the measured $b\bar{b}$ cross section, and a beauty flavor specific coalescence parameter $r_{BM}^b$ is introduced to match LHCb measurements of beauty baryon to meson ratios. With these refinements, AMPT achieves a reasonable agreement with experimental data on beauty hadron yields and non-prompt charm hadron production from ALICE and LHCb. We present the transverse momentum and multiplicity dependence of non-prompt to prompt charm hadron ratios, providing new insights into the interplay between beauty quark production and hadronization process. We emphasize that the multiplicity dependence of the non-prompt to prompt charm hadron productions can be useful to constrain the flavor dependences of the coalescence dynamics. This work establishes a unified framework for future studies of heavy quark transport and collective flow behavior in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>
