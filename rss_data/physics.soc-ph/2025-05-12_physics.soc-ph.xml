      <title>Why is distortion inevitable in opinion propagation on social media? Noise induced layer-wised synchronization in Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media as a dominant information propagation platform has intensified scholarly concerns about systemic information distortion,a phenomenon where content undergoes progressive alteration during multi layered transmission. However, existing literature extensively documents distortion patterns, the fundamental mechanisms coupling network architecture with cognitive noise remain poorly quantified. Here, we introduce a novel fractal network with coupled Noise Frustrated Hegselmann Krause (NFHK) framework that systematically disentangles these intertwined factors. By integrating fractal topology analysis with modified bounded confidence dynamics, our model reveals how hierarchical network structures (characterized by scale invariant connectivity patterns) amplify stochastic noise through successive retransmission layers. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, multi agent simulations, and empirical validation of typical retweet cascades, we demonstrate two key phenomena: (i) distortion escalates super linearly with network depth and (ii) peer nodes exhibit emergent layer wise synchronization despite lacking direct connections among themselves and form a number of synchronous groups based on the number of network layers. These findings establish a unified mechanism explaining distortion accumulation in digital ecosystems while challenging conventional "echo chamber" narratives. Our noise frustration protocol can offer actionable insights for policymakers to design topology aware regulatory frameworks. This work bridges complex systems theory with computational social science, providing both a mathematical foundation for distortion analysis and a toolkit for platform governance.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dense Crowd Dynamics: State of the Art and Emerging Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense pedestrian crowds may pose significant safety risks, yet their underlying dynamics remain insufficiently understood to reliably prevent accidents. In these environments, physical interactions and contact forces fundamentally shape the dynamics of the crowd. However, accurately describing these interindividual interactions requires specific modeling and analytical approaches. This chapter reviews paradigms and models used to represent pedestrian dynamics in various contexts, highlighting the transition from classical approaches to models tailored for dense crowd conditions. We argue that further investigation is needed, featuring new experimental studies and new modeling paradigms, to better capture the complex dynamics that emerge in high-density situations.</description>

      <title>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</description>

      <title>Modeling the 2022 Mpox Outbreak with a Mechanistic Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implemented a dynamic agent-based network model to simulate the spread of mpox in a United States-based MSM population. This model allowed us to implement data-informed dynamic network evolution to simulate realistic disease spreading and behavioral adaptations. We found that behavior change, the reduction in one-time partnerships, and widespread vaccination are effective in preventing the transmission of mpox and that earlier intervention has a greater effect, even when only a high-risk portion of the population participates. With no intervention, 16% of the population was infected (25th percentile, 75th percentiles of simulations: 15.3%, 16.6%). With vaccination and behavior change in only the 25% of individuals most likely to have a one-time partner, cumulative infections were reduced by 30%, or a total reduction in nearly 500 infections. Earlier intervention further reduces cumulative infections; beginning vaccination a year before the outbreak results in only 5.5% of men being infected, averting 950 infections or nearly 10% of the total population in our model. We also show that sustained partnerships drive the early outbreak, while one-time partnerships drive transmission after the first initial weeks. The median effective reproductive number, Rt, at t = 0 days is 1.30 for casual partnerships, 1.00 for main, and 0.6 for one-time. By t = 28, the median Rt for one-time partnerships has more than doubled to 1.48, while it decreased for casual and main partnerships: 0.46 and 0.29, respectively. With the ability to model individuals' behavior, mechanistic networks are particularly well suited to studying sexually transmitted infections, the spread and control of which are often governed by individual-level action. Our results contribute valuable insights into the role of different interventions and relationship types in mpox transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology</title>

Abstract: Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</description>

      <title>Complex totopapa: predicting the successor to pope Francis</title>

Abstract: Following the death of Pope Francis, the College of Cardinals will convene in conclave to elect the new Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
  In this report, we present a computational framework for analyzing the ideological landscape of the cardinal electors and estimating the likely outcomes of the upcoming papal election. We collected public textual data describing each cardinal's positions on a range of topics currently relevant to the Church, including sexuality, migration, poverty, governance and interreligious dialogue. These texts were embedded using a transformer-based language model to construct a semantic similarity matrix among cardinals. We then simulated conclave voting dynamics using this matrix as a proxy for ideological proximity. The model produced both topic-conditioned and aggregate probabilistic forecasts of election outcomes. We report the predicted leading candidates under various scenarios and discuss the structure of factional clustering revealed by the embeddings.
  The results highlight a polarized field with a small number of structurally central candidates, among whom Pietro Parolin, the former secretary of state, consistently emerges as the most broadly electable across thematic scenarios, followed by both high-profile and outsider names such as card. Brislin and Tagle. Post-election analysis added at the end of the document.</description>

      <title>Science of science -- Citation models and research evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citations in science are being studied from several perspectives, among which approaches such as scientometrics and science of science. In this chapter I briefly review some of the literature on citations, citation distributions and models of citations. These citations feature prominently in another part of the literature which is dealing with research evaluation and the role of metrics and indicators in that process. Here I briefly review part of the discussion in research evaluation. This also touches on the subject of how citations relate to peer review. Finally, I conclude by trying to integrate the two literatures. The fundamental problem in research evaluation is that research quality is unobservable. This has consequences for conclusions that we can draw from quantitative studies of citations and citation models. The term ``indicators'' is a relevant concept in this context, which I try to clarify. Causality is important for properly understanding indicators, especially when indicators are used in practice: when we act on indicators, we enter causal territory. Even when an indicator might have been valid, through its very use, the consequences of its use may invalidate it. By combining citation models with proper causal reasoning and acknowledging the fundamental problem about unobservable research quality, we may hope to make progress.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point coinciding with the graph symmetry phase transition, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with average degrees diverging logarithmically with the network size. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>
