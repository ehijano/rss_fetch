      <title>NCIDiff: Non-covalent Interaction-generative Diffusion Model for Improving Reliability of 3D Molecule Generation Inside Protein Pocket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in deep generative modeling have changed the paradigm of drug discovery. Among such approaches, target-aware methods that exploit 3D structures of protein pockets were spotlighted for generating ligand molecules with their plausible binding modes. While docking scores superficially assess the quality of generated ligands, closer inspection of the binding structures reveals the inconsistency in local interactions between a pocket and generated ligands. Here, we address the issue by explicitly generating non-covalent interactions (NCIs), which are universal patterns throughout protein-ligand complexes. Our proposed model, NCIDiff, simultaneously denoises NCI types of protein-ligand edges along with a 3D graph of a ligand molecule during the sampling. With the NCI-generating strategy, our model generates ligands with more reliable NCIs, especially outperforming the baseline diffusion-based models. We further adopted inpainting techniques on NCIs to further improve the quality of the generated molecules. Finally, we showcase the applicability of NCIDiff on drug design tasks for real-world settings with specialized objectives by guiding the generation process with desired NCI patterns.</description>

      <title>Saturn: Sample-efficient Generative Molecular Design using Memory Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative molecular design for drug discovery has very recently achieved a wave of experimental validation, with language-based backbones being the most common architectures employed. The most important factor for downstream success is whether an in silico oracle is well correlated with the desired end-point. To this end, current methods use cheaper proxy oracles with higher throughput before evaluating the most promising subset with high-fidelity oracles. The ability to directly optimize high-fidelity oracles would greatly enhance generative design and be expected to improve hit rates. However, current models are not efficient enough to consider such a prospect, exemplifying the sample efficiency problem. In this work, we introduce Saturn, which leverages the Augmented Memory algorithm and demonstrates the first application of the Mamba architecture for generative molecular design. We elucidate how experience replay with data augmentation improves sample efficiency and how Mamba synergistically exploits this mechanism. Saturn outperforms 22 models on multi-parameter optimization tasks relevant to drug discovery and may possess sufficient sample efficiency to consider the prospect of directly optimizing high-fidelity oracles.</description>

      <title>Retro-prob: Retrosynthetic Planning Based on a Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis is a fundamental but challenging task in organic chemistry, with broad applications in fields such as drug design and synthesis. Given a target molecule, the goal of retrosynthesis is to find out a series of reactions which could be assembled into a synthetic route which starts from purchasable molecules and ends at the target molecule. The uncertainty of reactions used in retrosynthetic planning, which is caused by hallucinations of backward models, has recently been noticed. In this paper we propose a succinct probabilistic model to describe such uncertainty. Based on the model, we propose a new retrosynthesis planning algorithm called retro-prob to maximize the successful synthesis probability of target molecules, which acquires high efficiency by utilizing the chain rule of derivatives. Experiments on the Paroutes benchmark show that retro-prob outperforms previous algorithms, retro* and retro-fallback, both in speed and in the quality of synthesis plans.</description>

      <title>Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.</description>

      <title>gRNAde: Geometric Deep Learning for 3D RNA inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14749v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D geometry and conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. [2010], gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent RNA polymerase ribozyme structure.

      <title>TSIS with A Comparative Study on Linear Molecular Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoding is the carrier of information. AI models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs. In this study, we introduce an encoding algorithm, TSIS (Simplified TSID), to the t-SMILES family as a fragment-based linear molecular representation. TSID has been demonstrated to significantly outperform classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, and SELFIES in previous work. A further comparative analysis in this study reveals that the tree structure used by TSID is more easily learned than anticipated, regardless of whether Transformer or LSTM models are used. Furthermore, TSIS demonstrates comparable performance to TSID and significantly outperforms SMILES, SELFIES, and SAFE. While SEFLIES and SAFE present significant challenges in semantic and syntactic analysis, respectively, due to their inherent complexity.</description>
