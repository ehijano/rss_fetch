      <title>Founding the First Chemistry Laboratory in Russia: Mikhail Lomonosov's Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article, the third in a series about the Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov (1711-1765), covers the first decade of his research at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, from his return from an educational his trip abroad in 1741, to the mid-1750s. Lomonosov's major focus was on the establishment of the first Russian laboratory used to introduce modern experimental chemistry and physics methods both to original research and education. The lab supported studies of the physics of colors, chemistry and physics of glasses and training of the Academy students. This article describes how Lomonosov, first an Adjunct Professor and then as a young Professor, fought to create the chemistry lab, and then to establish a broad program of experiments and tests there. The construction of laboratories to be used not just for research but also education only became widespread in the early 19th century, but Lomonosov's laboratory had a significant impact on the early development of the Academy and on Russian science.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic description of a feedback-control Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>
