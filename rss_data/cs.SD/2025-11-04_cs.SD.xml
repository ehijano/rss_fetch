      <title>Emotion Detection in Speech Using Lightweight and Transformer-Based Models: A Comparative and Ablation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech plays a vital role in the development of empathetic human-computer interaction systems. This paper presents a comparative analysis of lightweight transformer-based models, DistilHuBERT and PaSST, by classifying six core emotions from the CREMA-D dataset. We benchmark their performance against a traditional CNN-LSTM baseline model using MFCC features. DistilHuBERT demonstrates superior accuracy (70.64%) and F1 score (70.36%) while maintaining an exceptionally small model size (0.02 MB), outperforming both PaSST and the baseline. Furthermore, we conducted an ablation study on three variants of the PaSST, Linear, MLP, and Attentive Pooling heads, to understand the effect of classification head architecture on model performance. Our results indicate that PaSST with an MLP head yields the best performance among its variants but still falls short of DistilHuBERT. Among the emotion classes, angry is consistently the most accurately detected, while disgust remains the most challenging. These findings suggest that lightweight transformers like DistilHuBERT offer a compelling solution for real-time speech emotion recognition on edge devices.

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Speech Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of speech production based on physical models of the vocal folds and vocal tract is essential for studies on vocal-fold behavior and linguistic research. This paper proposes a speech production analysis method using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The networks are trained directly on the governing equations of vocal-fold vibration and vocal-tract acoustics. Vocal-fold collisions introduce nondifferentiability and vanishing gradients, challenging phenomena for PINNs. We demonstrate, however, that introducing a differentiable approximation function enables the analysis of vocal-fold vibrations within the PINN framework. The period of self-excited vocal-fold vibration is generally unknown. We show that by treating the period as a learnable network parameter, a periodic solution can be obtained. Furthermore, by implementing the coupling between glottal flow and vocal-tract acoustics as a hard constraint, glottis-tract interaction is achieved without additional loss terms. We confirmed the method's validity through forward and inverse analyses, demonstrating that the glottal flow rate, vocal-fold vibratory state, and subglottal pressure can be simultaneously estimated from speech signals. Notably, the same network architecture can be applied to both forward and inverse analyses, highlighting the versatility of this approach. The proposed method inherits the advantages of PINNs, including mesh-free computation and the natural incorporation of nonlinearities, and thus holds promise for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>More Than A Shortcut: A Hyperbolic Approach To Early-Exit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying accurate event detection on resource-constrained devices is challenged by the trade-off between performance and computational cost. While Early-Exit (EE) networks offer a solution through adaptive computation, they often fail to enforce a coherent hierarchical structure, limiting the reliability of their early predictions. To address this, we propose Hyperbolic Early-Exit networks (HypEE), a novel framework that learns EE representations in the hyperbolic space. Our core contribution is a hierarchical training objective with a novel entailment loss, which enforces a partial-ordering constraint to ensure that deeper network layers geometrically refine the representations of shallower ones. Experiments on multiple audio event detection tasks and backbone architectures show that HypEE significantly outperforms standard Euclidean EE baselines, especially at the earliest, most computationally-critical exits. The learned geometry also provides a principled measure of uncertainty, enabling a novel triggering mechanism that makes the overall system both more efficient and more accurate than a conventional EE and standard backbone models without early-exits.</description>

      <title>Feedback-driven Retrieval-augmented Audio Generation with Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general feedback-driven retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that leverages Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) to address the missing or imperfect synthesis of specific sound events in text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Unlike previous RAG-based TTA methods that typically train specialized models from scratch, we utilize LALMs to analyze audio generation outputs, retrieve concepts that pre-trained models struggle to generate from an external database, and incorporate the retrieved information into the generation process. Experimental results show that our method not only enhances the ability of LALMs to identify missing sound events but also delivers improvements across different models, outperforming existing RAG-specialized approaches.</description>

      <title>Speech-DRAME: A Framework for Human-Aligned Benchmarks in Speech Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-play has become a key testbed for generative models, expanding from text-only dialogue to multimodal interaction. Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present Speech-DRAME, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) Speech-DRAME-EvalBench, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models (SEMs), (ii) DRAME-Eval, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) Speech-DRAME-RoleBench, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages DRAME-Eval as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs). Speech-DRAME distinguishes between two complementary evaluation strategies: Archetype Evaluation, a top-down approach measuring adherence to broad role archetypes, and Realism Evaluation, a bottom-up approach grounded in real human speech that emphasizes nuanced role quality. Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, DRAME-Eval achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism). By integrating transparent benchmark resources, modeling approaches, and system-level evaluation, Speech-DRAME provides the first comprehensive, reproducible foundation for assessing spoken role-play.</description>

      <title>The Ghost in the Keys: A Disklavier Demo for Human-AI Musical Co-Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While generative models for music composition are increasingly capable, their adoption by musicians is hindered by text-prompting, an asynchronous workflow disconnected from the embodied, responsive nature of instrumental performance. To address this, we introduce Aria-Duet, an interactive system facilitating a real-time musical duet between a human pianist and Aria, a state-of-the-art generative model, using a Yamaha Disklavier as a shared physical interface. The framework enables a turn-taking collaboration: the user performs, signals a handover, and the model generates a coherent continuation performed acoustically on the piano. Beyond describing the technical architecture enabling this low-latency interaction, we analyze the system's output from a musicological perspective, finding the model can maintain stylistic semantics and develop coherent phrasal ideas, demonstrating that such embodied systems can engage in musically sophisticated dialogue and open a promising new path for human-AI co-creation.</description>

      <title>ADNAC: Audio Denoiser using Neural Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio denoising is critical in signal processing, enhancing intelligibility and fidelity for applications like restoring musical recordings. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for adapting a state-of-the-art neural audio codec, the Descript Audio Codec (DAC), for music denoising. This work overcomes the limitations of traditional architectures like U-Nets by training the model on a large-scale, custom-synthesized dataset built from diverse sources. Training is guided by a multi objective loss function that combines time-domain, spectral, and signal-level fidelity metrics. Ultimately, this paper aims to present a PoC for high-fidelity, generative audio restoration.</description>

      <title>NaturalVoices: A Large-Scale, Spontaneous and Emotional Podcast Dataset for Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Everyday speech conveys far more than words, it reflects who we are, how we feel, and the circumstances surrounding our interactions. Yet, most existing speech datasets are acted, limited in scale, and fail to capture the expressive richness of real-life communication. With the rise of large neural networks, several large-scale speech corpora have emerged and been widely adopted across various speech processing tasks. However, the field of voice conversion (VC) still lacks large-scale, expressive, and real-life speech resources suitable for modeling natural prosody and emotion. To fill this gap, we release NaturalVoices (NV), the first large-scale spontaneous podcast dataset specifically designed for emotion-aware voice conversion. It comprises 5,049 hours of spontaneous podcast recordings with automatic annotations for emotion (categorical and attribute-based), speech quality, transcripts, speaker identity, and sound events. The dataset captures expressive emotional variation across thousands of speakers, diverse topics, and natural speaking styles. We also provide an open-source pipeline with modular annotation tools and flexible filtering, enabling researchers to construct customized subsets for a wide range of VC tasks. Experiments demonstrate that NaturalVoices supports the development of robust and generalizable VC models capable of producing natural, expressive speech, while revealing limitations of current architectures when applied to large-scale spontaneous data. These results suggest that NaturalVoices is both a valuable resource and a challenging benchmark for advancing the field of voice conversion.

      <title>LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>Rhythm in the Air: Vision-based Real-Time Music Generation through Gestures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gesture recognition is an essential component of human-computer interaction (HCI), facilitating seamless interconnectivity between users and computer systems without physical touch. This paper introduces an innovative application of vision-based dynamic gesture recognition (VDGR) for real-time music composition through gestures. To implement this application, we generate a custom gesture dataset that encompasses over 15000 samples across 21 classes, incorporating 7 musical notes each manifesting at three distinct pitch levels. To effectively deal with the modest volume of training data and to accurately discern and prioritize complex gesture sequences for music creation, we develop a multi-layer attention-based gated recurrent unit (MLA-GRU) model, in which gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to learn temporal patterns from the observed sequence and an attention layer is employed to focus on musically pertinent gesture segments. Our empirical studies demonstrate that MLA-GRU significantly surpasses the classical GRU model, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 96.83% compared to the baseline's 86.7%. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior efficiency and processing speed, which are crucial for interactive applications. Using our proposed system, we believe that people will interact with music in a new and exciting way. It not only advances HCI experiences but also highlights MLA-GRU's effectiveness in scenarios demanding swift and precise gesture recognition.</description>

      <title>MULTI-Bench: A Multi-Turn Interactive Benchmark for Assessing Emotional Intelligence ability of Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their ability to sustain genuinely interactive multi-turn conversations remains underexplored, as most benchmarks focus on single-turn exchanges. We introduce Multi-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate SDMs in multi-turn interactive dialogue with an emphasis on emotional intelligence. Multi-Bench employs a hierarchical structure with a basic track for emotion understanding and reasoning and an advanced track for emotion support and application. It comprises five carefully designed tasks and about 3.2K samples, ranging from emotion recognition to complex reasoning and interactive dialogue, supported by a reproducible evaluation framework. We evaluate six representative SDMs on eight subsets of Multi-Bench. Results show that while current SDMs achieve good performance on basic understanding tasks, they still have room for improvement in advanced multi-turn interactive dialogue and reasoning-related tasks, particularly in emotion awareness and application.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Language Information for Target Language Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target Language Extraction aims to extract speech in a specific language from a mixture waveform that contains multiple speakers speaking different languages. The human auditory system is adept at performing this task with the knowledge of the particular language. However, the performance of the conventional extraction systems is limited by the lack of this prior knowledge. Speech pre-trained models, which capture rich linguistic and phonetic representations from large-scale in-the-wild corpora, can provide this missing language knowledge to these systems. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to leverage language knowledge from speech pre-trained models. This knowledge is used to guide the extraction model to better capture the target language characteristics, thereby improving extraction quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we construct the first publicly available multilingual dataset for Target Language Extraction. Experimental results show that our method achieves improvements of 1.22 dB and 1.12 dB in SI-SNR for English and German extraction, respectively, from mixtures containing both languages.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</description>

      <title>Temporal Feature Learning in Weakly Labelled Bioacoustic Cetacean Datasets via a Variational Autoencoder and Temporal Convolutional Network: An Interdisciplinary Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioacoustics data from Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) poses a unique set of challenges for classification, particularly the limited availability of complete and reliable labels in datasets due to annotation uncertainty, biological complexity due the heterogeneity in duration of cetacean vocalizations, and masking of target sounds due to environmental and anthropogenic noise. This means that data is often weakly labelled, with annotations indicating presence/absence of species over several minutes. In order to effectively capture the complex temporal patterns and key features of lengthy continuous audio segments, we propose an interdisciplinary framework comprising dataset standardisation, feature extraction via Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and classification via Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). This approach eliminates the necessity for manual threshold setting or time-consuming strong labelling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use sperm whale (&lt;i&gt;Physeter macrocephalus&lt;/i&gt;) click trains in 4-minute recordings as a case study, from a dataset comprising diverse sources and deployment conditions to maximise generalisability. The value of feature extraction via the VAE is demonstrated by comparing classification performance against the traditional and explainable approach of expert handpicking of features. The TCN demonstrated robust classification capabilities achieving AUC scores exceeding 0.9.</description>

      <title>AnyEnhance: A Unified Generative Model with Prompt-Guidance and Self-Critic for Voice Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AnyEnhance, a unified generative model for voice enhancement that processes both speech and singing voices. Based on a masked generative model, AnyEnhance is capable of handling both speech and singing voices, supporting a wide range of enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, declipping, super-resolution, and target speaker extraction, all simultaneously and without fine-tuning. AnyEnhance introduces a prompt-guidance mechanism for in-context learning, which allows the model to natively accept a reference speaker's timbre. In this way, it could boost enhancement performance when a reference audio is available and enable the target speaker extraction task without altering the underlying architecture. Moreover, we also introduce a self-critic mechanism into the generative process for masked generative models, yielding higher-quality outputs through iterative self-assessment and refinement. Extensive experiments on various enhancement tasks demonstrate AnyEnhance outperforms existing methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Demo audios are publicly available at https://amphionspace.github.io/anyenhance. An open-source implementation is provided at https://github.com/viewfinder-annn/anyenhance-v1-ccf-aatc.</description>

      <title>As Good as It KAN Get: High-Fidelity Audio Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

      <title>Music Arena: Live Evaluation for Text-to-Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

      <description>arXiv:2504.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual speech translation (ST) and machine translation (MT) in the medical domain enhances patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics. In this work, we present the first systematic study on medical ST, to our best knowledge, by releasing MultiMed-ST, a large-scale ST dataset for the medical domain, spanning all translation directions in five languages: Vietnamese, English, German, French, and Simplified/Traditional Chinese, together with the models. With 290,000 samples, this is the largest medical MT dataset and the largest many-to-many multilingual ST among all domains. Secondly, we present the most comprehensive ST analysis in the field's history, to our best knowledge, including: empirical baselines, bilingual-multilingual comparative study, end-to-end vs. cascaded comparative study, task-specific vs. multi-task sequence-to-sequence comparative study, code-switch analysis, and quantitative-qualitative error analysis.

      <title>Continuous Boostlet Transform and Associated Uncertainty Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Boostlet Transform (CBT) is introduced as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, particularly acoustic wavefields. Overcoming the limitations of classical wavelets, the CBT leverages the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations to capture sparse features of natural acoustic fields. This paper presents the mathematical framework of the CBT, including its definition, fundamental properties, and associated uncertainty principles, such as Heisenberg's, logarithmic, Pitt's, and Nazarov's inequalities. These results illuminate the trade-offs between time and frequency localization in the boostlet domain. Practical examples with constant and exponential functions highlight the CBT's adaptability. With applications in radar, communications, audio processing, and seismic analysis, the CBT offers flexible time-frequency resolution, making it ideal for non-stationary and transient signals, and a valuable tool for modern signal processing.</description>

      <title>Instance-Specific Test-Time Training for Speech Editing in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech editing systems aim to naturally modify speech content while preserving acoustic consistency and speaker identity. However, previous studies often struggle to adapt to unseen and diverse acoustic conditions, resulting in degraded editing performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose an instance-specific test-time training method for speech editing in the wild. Our approach employs direct supervision from ground-truth acoustic features in unedited regions and indirect supervision in edited regions via auxiliary losses based on duration constraints and phoneme prediction. This strategy mitigates the bandwidth discontinuity problem in speech editing, ensuring smooth acoustic transitions between unedited and edited regions. Additionally, it enables precise control over speech rate by adapting the model to target durations via mask length adjustment during test-time training. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing speech editing systems in both objective and subjective evaluations.</description>

      <title>Recent Trends in Distant Conversational Speech Recognition: A Review of CHiME-7 and 8 DASR Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges' design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1) Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation, suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques. Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even systems with over 50% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11%). 5) Despite recent progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive system ensembles.</description>

      <title>DSpAST: Disentangled Representations for Spatial Audio Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about spatial audio with large language models requires a spatial audio encoder as an acoustic front-end to obtain audio embeddings for further processing. Such an encoder needs to capture all information required to detect the type of sound events, as well as the direction and distance of their corresponding sources. Accomplishing this with a single audio encoder is demanding as the information required for each of these tasks is mostly independent of each other. As a result, the performance obtained with a single encoder is often worse than when using task-specific audio encoders. In this work, we present DSpAST, a novel audio encoder based on SpatialAST that learns disentangled representations of spatial audio while having only 0.2% additional parameters. Experiments on SpatialSoundQA with the spatial audio reasoning system BAT demonstrate that DSpAST significantly outperforms SpatialAST.</description>

      <title>Audio Driven Real-Time Facial Animation for Social Telepresence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (&lt;15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.</description>

Abstract: While the ambient intelligence (AmI) systems we encounter in our daily lives, including security monitoring and energy-saving systems, typically serve pragmatic purposes, we wonder how we can design and implement ambient artificial intelligence experiences in public spaces that elicit deep human feelings of awe, wonder, and beauty. As a manifestation, we introduce Sound Clouds, an immersive art installation that generates live music based on participants' interaction with several human-height spheres. Our installation serves as a provocation into future ambient intelligence that provokes, not limits, the future possibilities of AmI.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Attention Sinks and Massive Activations in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</description>
