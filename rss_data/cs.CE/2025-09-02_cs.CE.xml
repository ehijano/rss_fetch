      <title>Kernel manifolds: nonlinear-augmentation dimensionality reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes recent advances on quadratic manifold (QM) dimensionality reduction by developing kernel methods-based nonlinear-augmentation dimensionality reduction. QMs, and more generally feature map-based nonlinear corrections, augment linear dimensionality reduction with a nonlinear correction term in the reconstruction map to overcome approximation accuracy limitations of purely linear approaches. While feature map-based approaches typically learn a least-squares optimal polynomial correction term, we generalize this approach by learning an optimal nonlinear correction from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our approach allows one to impose arbitrary nonlinear structure on the correction term, including polynomial structure, and includes feature map and radial basis function-based corrections as special cases. Furthermore, our method has relatively low training cost and has monotonically decreasing error as the latent space dimension increases. We compare our approach to proper orthogonal decomposition and several recent QM approaches on data from several example problems.</description>

      <title>I-FENN with DeepONets: accelerating simulations in coupled multiphysics problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled multiphysics simulations for high-dimensional, large-scale problems can be prohibitively expensive due to their computational demands. This article presents a novel framework integrating a deep operator network (DeepONet) with the Finite Element Method (FEM) to address coupled thermoelasticity and poroelasticity problems. This integration occurs within the context of I-FENN, a framework where neural networks are directly employed as PDE solvers within FEM, resulting in a hybrid staggered solver. In this setup, the mechanical field is computed using FEM, while the other coupled field is predicted using a neural network (NN). By decoupling multiphysics interactions, the hybrid framework reduces computational cost by simplifying calculations and reducing the FEM unknowns, while maintaining flexibility across unseen scenarios. The proposed work introduces a new I-FENN architecture with extended generalizability due to the DeepONets ability to efficiently address several combinations of natural boundary conditions and body loads. A modified DeepONet architecture is introduced to accommodate multiple inputs, along with a streamlined strategy for enforcing boundary conditions on distinct boundaries. We showcase the applicability and merits of the proposed work through numerical examples covering thermoelasticity and poroelasticity problems, demonstrating computational efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. In all examples, the test cases involve unseen loading conditions. The computational savings scale with the model complexity while preserving an accuracy of more than 95\% in the non-trivial regions of the domain.</description>

      <title>A new definition of peridynamic damage for thermo-mechanical fracture modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermo-mechanical fracture modeling is proposed to address thermal failure issues, where the temperature field is calculated by a heat conduction model based on classical continuum mechanics (CCM), while the deformation field with discontinuities is calculated by the peridynamic (PD) model. The model is calculated by a CCM/PD alternating solution based on the finite element discretization, which ensures the calculation accuracy and facilitates engineering applications. The original PD model defines damage solely based on the number of broken bonds in the vicinity of the material point, neglecting the distribution of these bonds. To address this limitation, a new definition of the PD damage accounting for both the number of broken bonds and their specific distribution is proposed. As a result, damage in various directions can be captured, enabling more realistic thermal fracture simulations based on a unified mesh discretization. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparing numerical examples with analytical solutions. Moreover, simulation results of quasi-static and dynamic crack propagation demonstrate the model's ability to aid in understanding the initiation and propagation mechanisms of complex thermal fractures.</description>

      <title>RAMS: Residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample method for scientific machine learning in solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS. Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field.</description>

      <title>A continuum multi-species biofilm model with a novel interaction scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofilms are complex structures which are inhabited by numerous amount of different species of microorganisms. Due to their ubiquity, they influence human life on an everyday basis. It is therefore important to understand the interactions between different biofilm components and reactions to outside conditions. For this purpose, mathematical models and in silico experiments have proven themselves to be fundamental. In combination with in vitro and in vivo experiments, they can give more insights and focus researchers' attention, reducing costs in the process. In this work, a comprehensive multi-species continuum-based biofilm model is presented. This model is capable of replicating a variety of different biofilm interactions with an arbitrary number of species, while still being comprehensive to encourage usage by researchers less familiar with mathematical modeling. In addition to a nutrient source, antibiotic agents and their effect on the biofilm can also be depicted. The model is derived using Hamilton's principle of stationary action, ensuring thermodynamic consistency automatically. The results show good quantitative agreement with biofilm behavior.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Alpha Weighting with PPO: Enhancing Prompt-Based LLM-Generated Alphas in Quant Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically optimize the weights of multiple large language model (LLM)-generated formulaic alphas for stock trading strategies. Formulaic alphas are mathematically defined trading signals derived from price, volume, sentiment, and other data. Although recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate diverse and effective alphas, a critical challenge lies in how to adaptively integrate them under varying market conditions. To address this gap, we leverage the deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model to generate fifty alphas for five major stocks: Apple, HSBC, Pepsi, Toyota, and Tencent, and then use PPO to adjust their weights in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the PPO-optimized strategy achieves strong returns and high Sharpe ratios across most stocks, outperforming both an equal-weighted alpha portfolio and traditional benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225, S&amp;P 500, and Hang Seng Index. The findings highlight the importance of reinforcement learning in the allocation of alpha weights and show the potential of combining LLM-generated signals with adaptive optimization for robust financial forecasting and trading.</description>

      <title>Revisit of Two-dimensional CEM on Crack Branching: from Single Crack-tip Tracking to Multiple Crack-tips Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a Multiple Crack-tips Tracking algorithm in two-dimensional Crack Element Model (MCT-2D-CEM) is developed, aiming at modeling and predicting advanced and complicated crack patterns in two-dimensional dynamic fracturing problems, such as crack branching and fragmentation. Based on the developed fracture energy release rate formulation of split elementary topology, the Multiple Crack-tips Tracking algorithm is proposed and a series of benchmark examples are provided to validate effectiveness and efficiency in modeling crack branching and fragmentation. Besides, the proposed MCR-2D-CEM can still model single crack propagation but extra micro-cracks are introduced. GPU acceleration is employed in all two-dimensional simulations, providing high computational efficiency, consistency, and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Computational Fluid Dynamics Optimization of F1 Front Wing using Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results, require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24 hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12 aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination (R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of design space within regulatory constraints.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Fueled Modelfluid for Flowsheet Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process optimization in chemical engineering may be hindered by the limited availability of reliable thermodynamic data for fluid mixtures.
  Remarkable progress is being made in predicting thermodynamic mixture properties by machine learning techniques. The vast information provided by these prediction methods enables new possibilities in process optimization.
  This work introduces a novel modelfluid representation that is designed to seamlessly integrate these ML-predicted data directly into flowsheet optimization. Tailored for distillation, our approach is built on physically interpretable and continuous features derived from core vapor liquid equilibrium phenomena. This ensures compatibility with existing simulation tools and gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the power and accuracy of this ML-fueled modelfluid by applying it to the problem of entrainer selection for an azeotropic separation. The results show that our framework successfully identifies optimal, thermodynamically consistent entrainers with high fidelity compared to conventional models.
  Ultimately, this work provides a practical pathway to incorporate large-scale property prediction into efficient process design and optimization, overcoming the limitations of both traditional thermodynamic models and complex molecular-based equations of state.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical computational model of the human stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stomach plays a central role in digestion through coordinated muscle contractions, known as gastric peristalsis, driven by slow-wave electrophysiology. Understanding this process is critical for treating motility disorders such as gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Computer simulations can be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of these disorders and help to develop new therapies. However, existing approaches often neglect spatial heterogeneity, fail to capture large anisotropic deformations, or rely on computationally expensive three-dimensional formulations. We present here a computational framework of human gastric electromechanics, that combines a nonlinear, rotation-free shell formulation with a constrained mixture material model. The formulation incorporates active-strain, constituent-specific prestress, and spatially non-uniform parameter fields. Numerical examples demonstrate that the framework can reproduce characteristic features of gastric motility, including slow-wave entrainment, conduction velocity gradients, and large peristaltic contractions with physiologically realistic amplitudes. The proposed framework enables robust electromechanical simulations of the whole stomach at the organ scale. It thus provides a promising basis for future in silico studies of both physiological function and pathological motility disorders.</description>

      <title>Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Estimating Parameter Fields in Multi-Physics PDEs from Scarce Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering, healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics, multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering, healthcare, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Stabilization techniques for immersogeometric analysis of plate and shell problems in explicit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite element plate and shell formulations are ubiquitous in structural analysis for modeling all kinds of slender structures, both for static and dynamic analyses. The latter are particularly challenging as the high order nature of the underlying partial differential equations and the slenderness of the structures all impose a stringent constraint on the critical time step in explicit dynamics. Unfortunately, badly cut elements in immersed finite element discretizations further aggravate the issue. While lumping the mass matrix often increases the critical time step, it might also trigger spurious oscillations in the approximate solution thereby compromising the numerical solution. In this article, we extend our previous work in \cite{voet2025stabilization} to allow stable immersogeometric analysis of plate and shell problems with lumped mass matrices. This technique is based on polynomial extensions and restores a level of accuracy comparable to boundary-fitted discretizations.</description>

      <title>On the Thermal Vulnerability of 3D-Stacked High-Bandwidth Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) architectures provide high-performance memory interactions to address the well-known performance challenge, namely the memory wall. However, these architectures are susceptible to thermal vulnerabilities due to the inherent vertical adjacency that occurs during the manufacturing process of HBM architectures. We anticipate that adversaries may exploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop thermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host data/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary manages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or laterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that maximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its data/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any out-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests and the operating system's memory management policies. In other words, since the attack mimics legitimate workloads, it will be challenging to detect.</description>

      <title>Resting-state fMRI Analysis using Quantum Time-series Transformer</title>

Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling for Personalized Transcranial Electrical Stimulation: Theory, Tools, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>LKA: Large Kernel Adapter for Enhanced Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the notable success of current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across various domains, their effectiveness on medical datasets falls short of expectations. This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Modeling Maritime Transportation Behavior Using AIS Trajectories and Markovian Processes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is central to the global economy, and analyzing its large-scale behavioral data is critical for operational planning, environmental stewardship, and governance. This work presents a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to model vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with particular emphasis on disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the maritime domain into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for distinct vessel types using cell transition frequencies and dwell times. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize maritime dynamics across multiple temporal resolutions. Focusing on commercial, fishing, and passenger vessels, we analyze the temporal evolution of mobility behaviors during the pandemic, highlighting significant yet transient disruptions to recurring transport patterns. The methodology we contribute to this paper allows for an extensive behavioral analytics key for transportation planning. Accordingly, our findings reveal vessel-specific mobility signatures that persist across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting behaviors invariant to time. In contrast, we observe temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, reflecting the influence of social isolation measures and operational constraints on non-essential maritime transport in this region.</description>

      <title>SolarSeer: Ultrafast and accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts outperforming numerical weather prediction across the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating 24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28% in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast, accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.</description>

      <title>BConformeR: A Conformer Based on Mutual Sampling for Unified Prediction of Continuous and Discontinuous Antibody Binding Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on both linear and conformational epitopes.</description>
