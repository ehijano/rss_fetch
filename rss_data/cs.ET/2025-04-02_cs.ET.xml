      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry in Quantum Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) in Quantum Wireless Sensor Networks (QWSNs) to enhance communication performance. QWSNs combine quantum communication principles with traditional wireless sensor network technologies, offering the potential for improved security, energy efficiency, and signal quality. TRS, a concept from signal processing and quantum mechanics, focuses transmitted signals back toward the receiver, compensating for noise, interference, and fading effects. By applying TRS to QWSNs, we aim to optimize throughput, reduce latency, and enhance energy efficiency in challenging communication environments. The paper presents a theoretical framework for integrating TRS into QWSNs, including mathematical formulations for its impact on key network performance metrics. We also consider real-world channel models, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, along with network interference, to demonstrate how TRS can improve communication in practical settings. The discussion extends to the broader potential of TRS in quantum communication systems, particularly in **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**, **quantum entanglement**, and **quantum networking** applications. The findings highlight TRS as a promising approach to optimize quantum communication in sensor networks and provide a foundation for future research in the intersection of quantum technologies and wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Oscillator-Based Ising Machine Models with Amplitude Dynamics and Polynomial Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an oscillator model with both phase and amplitude dynamics for oscillator-based Ising machines that addresses combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order. Our approach addresses fundamental limitations of previous oscillator-based Ising machines through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Survey of mmWave Backscatter: Applications, Platforms, and Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key enabling technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communication networks, millimeter wave (mmWave) backscatter has undergone noteworthy advancements and brought significant improvement to prevailing sensing and communication systems. Past few years have witnessed growing efforts in innovating mmWave backscatter transmitters (e.g., tags and metasurfaces) and the corresponding techniques, which provide efficient information embedding and fine-grained signal manipulation for mmWave backscatter technologies. These efforts have greatly enabled a variety of appealing applications, such as long-range localization, roadside-to-vehicle communication, coverage optimization and large-scale identification. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive survey to systematically summarize the works related to the topic of mmWave backscatter. Firstly, we introduce the scope of this survey and provide a taxonomy to distinguish two categories of mmWave backscatter research based on the operating principle of the backscatter transmitter: modulation-based and relay-based. Furthermore, existing works in each category are grouped and introduced in detail, with their common applications, platforms and technologies, respectively. Finally, we elaborate on potential directions and discuss related surveys in this area.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stakeholder Disaster Insights from Social Media Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, social media has emerged as a primary channel for users to promptly share feedback and issues during disasters and emergencies, playing a key role in crisis management. While significant progress has been made in collecting and analyzing social media content, there remains a pressing need to enhance the automation, aggregation, and customization of this data to deliver actionable insights tailored to diverse stakeholders, including the press, police, EMS, and firefighters. This effort is essential for improving the coordination of activities such as relief efforts, resource distribution, and media communication. This paper presents a methodology that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to enhance disaster response and management. Our approach combines classification techniques with generative AI to bridge the gap between raw user feedback and stakeholder-specific reports. Social media posts shared during catastrophic events are analyzed with a focus on user-reported issues, service interruptions, and encountered challenges. We employ full-spectrum LLMs, using analytical models like BERT for precise, multi-dimensional classification of content type, sentiment, emotion, geolocation, and topic. Generative models such as ChatGPT are then used to produce human-readable, informative reports tailored to distinct audiences, synthesizing insights derived from detailed classifications. We compare standard approaches, which analyze posts directly using prompts in ChatGPT, to our advanced method, which incorporates multi-dimensional classification, sub-event selection, and tailored report generation. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative metrics, such as text coherence scores and latent representations, and qualitative assessments by automated tools and field experts, delivering precise insights for diverse disaster response stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive AI Governance: Comparative Insights from the U.S., EU, and Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence.</description>

      <title>Semantic Learning for Molecular Communication in Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for information transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where efficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of molecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and intersymbol interference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to optimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical diagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework employs a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize, and decode semantic features, prioritizing taskrelevant semantic information to enhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic channel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics, enabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic accuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC coding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.</description>
