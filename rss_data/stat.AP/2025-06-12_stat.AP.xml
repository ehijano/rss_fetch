      <title>Educational Intervention Re-Wires Social Interactions in Isolated Village Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks shape behavior, disseminate information, and undergird collective action within communities. Consequently, they can be very valuable in the design of effective interventions to improve community well-being. But any exogenous intervention in networked groups, including ones that just involve the provision of information, can also possibly modify the underlying network structure itself, and some interventions are indeed designed to do so. While social networks obey certain fundamental principles (captured by network-level statistics, such as the degree distribution or transitivity level), they can nevertheless undergo change across time, as people form and break ties with each other within an overall population. Here, using a randomized controlled trial in 110 remote Honduran villages involving 8,331 people, we evaluated the effects of a 22-month public health intervention on pre-existing social network structures. We leverage a two-stage randomized design, where a varying fraction of households received the intervention in each village. In low-dosage villages (5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) compared to untreated villages (0%), over a two-year period, individuals who received the intervention tended to sever both inbound and outbound ties with untreated individuals whom they previously trusted for health advice. Conversely, in high-dosage villages (50%, 75%, and 100%), treated individuals increased both their inbound and outbound ties. Furthermore, although the intervention was health-focused, it also reshaped broader friendship and financial ties. In aggregate, the imposition of a novel health information regime in rural villages (as a kind of social institution) led to a significant rewiring in individuals particular connections, but it still had a limited effect on the overall global structure of the village-wide social networks.</description>

      <title>A composition of simplified physics-based model with neural operator for trajectory-level seismic response predictions of structural systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of nonlinear structural responses is essential for earthquake risk assessment and management. While high-fidelity nonlinear time history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of an optimal treatment rule with fused randomized trials and missing effect modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental principle of clinical medicine is that a treatment should only be administered to those patients who would benefit from it. Treatment strategies that assign treatment to patients as a function of their individual characteristics are known as dynamic treatment rules. The dynamic treatment rule that optimizes the outcome in the population is called the optimal dynamic treatment rule. Randomized clinical trials are considered the gold standard for estimating the marginal causal effect of a treatment on an outcome; they are often not powered to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, and thus, may rarely inform more personalized treatment decisions. The availability of multiple trials studying a common set of treatments presents an opportunity for combining data, often called data-fusion, to better estimate dynamic treatment rules. However, there may be a mismatch in the set of patient covariates measured across trials. We address this problem here; we propose a nonparametric estimator for the optimal dynamic treatment rule that leverages information across the set of randomized trials. We apply the estimator to fused randomized trials of medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder to estimate a treatment rule that would match patient subgroups with the medication that would minimize risk of return to regular opioid use.</description>

      <title>Classification of multiple segmented profiles, application to the study of the neuronal protein Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is motivated by an application in neuroscience, in particular by the study of the (dys)functioning of a protein called Tau. The objective is to establish a classification of intensity profiles, according to the presence or absence of the protein and its monomer or dimer proportion. For this, we propose a Gaussian mixture model with a fixed number of clusters whose mean parameters are constrained and shared by the clusters. The inference of this model is done via the classical EM algorithm. The performance of the method is evaluated via simulation studies and an application on real data is done.</description>

      <title>Comparing name generator designs in rural panel studies: analyzing alter retention and change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a two-wave personal network study in a rural Romanian community, interviewing the same participants (n = 68) using two name generators. Wave 1 employed a fixed-choice generator (n = 25) focused on emotional closeness; Wave 2 used a free-choice generator based on frequent interaction. We compared tie characteristics and assessed retention across waves. Alters who were kin, co-residents, or emotionally close were more likely to be retained, regardless of generator type. These findings underscore the role of relational attributes in personal network stability and highlight design considerations for network studies in resource-limited, culturally distinct settings.</description>

      <title>Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data. By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Multisource Fusion Model for Spatiotemporal PM2.5 in an Urban Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major public health concern in urban environments, where population density and emission sources exacerbate exposure risks. We present a novel Bayesian spatiotemporal fusion model to estimate monthly PM2.5 concentrations over Greater London (2014-2019) at 1km resolution. The model integrates multiple PM2.5 data sources, including outputs from two atmospheric air quality dispersion models and predictive variables, such as vegetation and satellite aerosol optical depth, while explicitly modelling a latent spatiotemporal field. Spatial misalignment of the data is addressed through an upscaling approach to predict across the entire area. Building on stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) within the integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) framework, our method introduces spatially- and temporally-varying coefficients to flexibly calibrate datasets and capture fine-scale variability. Model performance and complexity are balanced using predictive metrics such as the predictive model choice criterion and thorough cross-validation. The best performing model shows excellent fit and solid predictive performance, enabling reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of PM2.5 concentrations with the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, the model outputs, including full posterior predictive distributions, can be used to map exceedance probabilities of regulatory thresholds, supporting air quality management and targeted interventions in vulnerable urban areas, as well as providing refined exposure estimates of PM2.5 for epidemiological applications.</description>

      <title>Predictions of damages from Atlantic tropical cyclones: a hierarchical Bayesian study on extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian hierarchical models are proposed for modeling tropical cyclone characteristics and their damage potential in the Atlantic basin. We model the joint probability distribution of tropical cyclone characteristics and their damage potential at two different temporal scales, while taking several climate indices into account. First, a predictive model for an entire season is developed that forecasts the number of cyclone events that will take place, the probability of each cyclone causing some amount of damage, and the monetized value of damages. Then, specific characteristics of individual cyclones are considered to predict the monetized value of the damage it will cause. Robustness studies are conducted and excellent prediction power is demonstrated across different data science models and evaluation techniques.</description>

      <title>Urban mapping in Dar es Salaam using AJIVE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping deprivation in urban areas is important, for example for identifying areas of greatest need and planning interventions. Traditional ways of obtaining deprivation estimates are based on either census or household survey data, which in many areas is unavailable or difficult to collect. However, there has been a huge rise in the amount of new, non-traditional forms of data, such as satellite imagery and cell-phone call-record data, which may contain information useful for identifying deprivation. We use Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) to jointly model satellite imagery data, cell-phone data, and survey data for the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We first identify interpretable low-dimensional structure from the imagery and cell-phone data, and find that we can use these to identify deprivation. We then consider what is gained from further incorporating the more traditional and costly survey data. We also introduce a scalar measure of deprivation as a response variable to be predicted, and consider various approaches to multiview regression, including using AJIVE scores as predictors.</description>

      <title>Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust model performance in diverse real-world scenarios requires addressing generalizability across domains with covariate shifts. However, no formal procedure exists for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning algorithms. Existing predictive metrics like mean squared error (MSE) help to quantify the relative performance between models, but do not directly answer whether a model can or cannot generalize. To address this gap in the domain of causal inference, we propose a systematic framework for statistically evaluating the generalizability of high-dimensional causal inference models. Our approach uses the frugal parameterization to flexibly simulate from fully and semi-synthetic causal benchmarks, offering a comprehensive evaluation for both mean and distributional regression methods. Grounded in real-world data, our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics, providing statistical safeguards for decision making.</description>

      <title>Selecting ChIP-seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of interest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given that ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for determining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is between-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To illustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions for downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count data where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We then externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence peakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets obtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two experimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as differentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are less sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a more robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Improving exponential-family random graph models for bipartite networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs, representing two-mode networks, arise in many research fields. These networks have two disjoint node sets representing distinct entity types, for example persons and groups, with edges representing associations between the two entity types. In bipartite graphs, the smallest possible cycle is a cycle of length four, and hence four-cycles are the smallest structure to model closure in such networks. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) are a widely used model for social, and other, networks, including specifically bipartite networks. Existing ERGM terms to model four-cycles in bipartite networks, however, are relatively rarely used. In this work we demonstrate some problems with these existing terms to model four-cycles, and define new ERGM terms to help overcome these problems. The position of the new terms in the ERGM dependence hierarchy, and their interpretation, is discussed. The new terms are demonstrated in simulation experiments, and their application illustrated on a canonical example of an empirical two-mode network.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bernstein Normalizing Flows for Flexible Multivariate Density Regression with Interpretable Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Tailored Behavior Change Messaging: Connecting Contextual Bandit with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB) algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However, cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy, social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone, combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization (RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.</description>

Abstract: The rising number of extreme climate events in the past decades has motivated the need for a thorough consideration of tropical cyclone genesis and intensity, given the sea-surface temperature (SST). In this paper, we present an analysis of the relationship between the increasing global SST with cyclone genesis using linear regression machine learning models. We extract and curate a dataset of tropical cyclones across selected ocean basins with their associated SST over the past 40 years. We provide correlation analysis using linear regression and visualisation strategies. Our preliminary results show a strong positive correlation between SST and high wind speed across selected ocean basins via linear regression and machine learning models. Our dataset and available open-source code offer a novel perspective for the investigation of the genesis and intensity of tropical cyclones. Alongside the time and position of each cyclone, we also provide the related Saffir-Simpson category, season, wind speed, and SST for 15 days before and after the tropical cyclone genesis.</description>
