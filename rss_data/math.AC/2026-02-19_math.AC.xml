      <title>On Toric Ideals Arising from the Chip-Firing Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain groups and ideals arising from the chip-firing game on a generalisation of graphs called pargraphs. Several well-known families of toric ideals, including those defining rational normal curves and binomial edge ideals of complete graphs, arise as toppling ideals of pargraphs. We provide sufficient conditions under which the toppling ideal of a pargraph to be toric. In addition, we construct a Gr\"obner basis for the toppling ideal, a minimal cellular free resolution for a distinguished initial ideal known as the $G$-parking function ideal, and establish Cohen-Macaulay property for these ideals. We also study the Picard group of a pargraph and provide sufficient conditions ensuring its freeness.</description>

      <title>Cohomological support varieties of certain monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of Briggs, Grifo and Pollitz arXiv:2506.10827, we give an example of two cohomological support varieties of monomial ideals which are not unions of linear subspaces. We provide a procedure for the computation of the cohomological support varieties of certain other monomial ideals - including those with homogeneous generators - with improved computational efficiency, leading to a computer-assisted verification of the existence of a third support variety of a monomial ideal which is not a union of linear subspaces and a computer-assisted proof of a classification of cohomological support varieties of homogeneous monomial ideals over $\mathbb{Q}$ with 6 generators.</description>

      <title>Macaulay Constants and Vanishing of Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dub\'e introduced cone decompositions and their Macaulay constants and used them to obtain an upper bound on the degrees of the generators in a Gr\"obner basis of an ideal. Liang extended the theory to submodules of a free module. In this paper, Macaulay constants of any finitely generated graded module $M$ over a polynomial ring are introduced by adapting the concept of a cone decomposition to $M$. It is shown that these constants provide upper bounds for the degrees in which the local cohomology modules of $M$ are not zero. The results include an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $M$ and a generalization of Gotzmann's Regularity Theorem from ideals to modules. As an application, an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of any coherent sheaf on projective space is established. The mentioned bounds are sharp even for cyclic modules. Furthermore, Macaulay constants are utilized to provide a characterization of Hilbert polynomials of finitely generated graded modules.</description>

      <title>Closure operations induced via resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the fact that the structure sheaf of a resolution of singularities, or regular alteration, pushes forward to a Cohen-Macaulay complex in equal characteristic zero with a differential graded algebra structure, we introduce a tight-closure-like operation on ideals in equal characteristic zero using the Koszul complex, which we call KH (Koszul-Hironaka). We prove it satisfies various strong colon capturing properties, a substantial case of the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem, and it behaves well under finite extensions. It detects rational singularities and is tighter than tight closure in equal characteristic zero. Furthermore, its formation commutes with localization and it can be computed effectively. On the other hand, the product of the KH closures of ideals is not always contained in the KH of the product, as one might expect.
  We also explore a related closure operation (canonical alteration closure), induced by canonical modules of regular alterations, which detects KLT-type singularities in equal characteristic zero and which is closely related to tight closure in characteristic $p &gt; 0$. For parameter ideals we show both these closure operations coincide and reduce modulo $p \gg 0$ to tight closure. Finally, we explore an intermediate operation (Hironaka pre-closure) which which satisfies numerous desired properties, but for which we have not been able to prove idempotence.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</description>
