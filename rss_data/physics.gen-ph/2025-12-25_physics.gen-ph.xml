      <title>Breakthrough on dynamical higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity: Example in which graviton gains mass through electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20672</link>

Abstract: Massive gravity is an interesting theoretical framework capable of explaining among others things cosmological IR (infra-red) phenomena like late-time cosmic acceleration. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very difficult of getting consistent massive gravity theory due, among other things, to ghost appearance and strong coupling break-down problems. Of course, even though since the work of de Rham, Gabadadge and Tolley; the ghost problem appears overcame; things remain unchanged for the strong coupling break-down problem which is the problem that a massive gravity of experimentally viable graviton mass $m$ has (in comparison of standard massless gravity theory) a very low cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3= \Big[m^2M_P\Big]^{\frac{1}{3}}$ above which the theory fails; a problem what must be resolved if we want massive gravity be a consistent physical theory which can pretend to describe nature. Now as we know, one of the better way of overcoming this strong coupling break-down problem of massive gravity is to have a dynamical Higgs mechanism for gravity capable of providing a clear-cut way of making the graviton massless dynamically above the cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3$; a challenge what turned out to be difficult to surmount. It is this difficult that I overcome in the present paper by showing that it is quite possible of getting a four-dimensional modified massless gravity theory which becomes dynamically massive through for example the dynamical standard model electroweak phase transition. More precisely, I propose the first example of dynamical Higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity permitting to overcome the strong coupling break-down problem of dRGT gravity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gravity from a Spontaneously Broken Gauge Symmetry: a Pre-geometric Prospective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the paradigm of pre-geometric gravity, where spacetime geometry and the gravitational field are not fundamental but emerge from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a larger gauge symmetry. Specifically, we consider a gauge theory based on the de Sitter $SO(1,4)$ or anti-de Sitter $SO(3,2)$ group, formulated on a manifold without a prior metric structure. General covariance is maintained by constructing Lagrangian densities using the Levi-Civita symbol. The SSB is triggered by an internal vector field $\phi^A$, which reduces the symmetry to the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$ and dynamically generates a spacetime metric. We analyze two specific models: the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation, which yields the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet term, and the Wilczek model, which produces a pure Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In both cases, the observed Planck mass and the small cosmological constant emerge from a see-saw mechanism dependent on the symmetry-breaking scale. We then present the Hamiltonian formulation of this pre-geometric theory, demonstrating that it possesses three number of physical degrees of freedom, corresponding to a massless graviton and a massive scalar. Integrating out the massive scalar, the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian of General Relativity is obtained after SSB. This establishes a foundational bridge between pre-geometric theories and canonical quantum gravity approaches like Loop Quantum Gravity, and allows for the formulation of a pre-geometric Wheeler-DeWitt equation.</description>

      <title>A new understanding of Einstein-Rosen bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime, which emerges from the unification of special relativity and quantum mechanics, is based on treating time as a parameter, assuming a fixed arrow of time, and requiring that field operators commute for spacelike distances. This procedure is questioned here in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). In 1935, Einstein and Rosen (ER), in their seminal paper [1] proposed that "a particle in the physical Universe has to be described by mathematical bridges connecting two sheets of spacetime" which involved two arrows of time. Recently proposed direct-sum quantum theory reconciles this ER's vision by introducing geometric superselection sectors associated with the regions of spacetime related by discrete transformations. We further establish that the quantum effects at gravitational horizons involve the physics of quantum inverted harmonic oscillators that have phase space horizons. This new understanding of the ER bridges is not related to classical wormholes, it addresses the original ER puzzle and promises a unitary description of QFTCS, along with observer complementarity. Furthermore, we present compelling evidence for our new understanding of ER bridges in the form of large-scale parity asymmetric features in the cosmic microwave background, which is statistically 650 times stronger than the standard scale-invariant power spectrum from the typical understanding of inflationary quantum fluctuations when compared with the posterior probabilities associated with the model given the data. We finally discuss the implications of this new understanding in combining gravity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Experimental estimation of Asymmetry of Radiation for Wheeler-Feynman theory for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory assumes there should be both retarded EM waves but also advanced, however, with symmetric 1/2-1/2 contributions. In contrast, observed Asymmetry of Radiation like inspiraling has lead to currently default assumption of 1-0 only retarded. Any convex combination is allowed, its choice should depend on the boundary conditions like imbalance between absorbers and emitters - while we have domination of absorbers, it does not need to be complete, suggesting to estimate emitters/absorbers asymmetry parameter from data. It could lead to confirmation of current assumption, or requirement to also include advanced waves into considerations.
  Experimental estimation of such Asymmetry of Radiation is currently difficult for EM waves due to asymmetry between receivers and transmitters. However, e.g. LIGO just measures lengths, which are invariant to T/CPT symmetry, making available gravitational wave observations appropriate for such estimation. We also discuss other arguments for nonzero contributions of advanced waves. For example gravitational observation of e.g. neutron star merger, with required but clearly missing (retarded) EM counterpart, would leave possibility of being advanced wave. Also there are observed events happening too early according to current knowledge e.g. mergers of black holes in the Mass Gap, or insufficient number of retarded sources e.g. for vibrations of the Universe observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy and cardinality of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two methods for evaluating the cardinality of the Cartesian product $N \times N$ of the set of natural numbers $N$. The first is used to explain the thermodynamics of black body radiation by using convergent functions on $N \times N$. The cardinality of $N \times N$ enters through the partition function, internal energy and entropy for every macrostate given by a normal mode of electromagnetic wave. Here, $N \times N$ is assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. The second method was devised in analysis to count the rational numbers by using divergent functions on $N \times N$. Here, $N \times N$ is not assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. In this article, we show that the experimentally confirmed first approach is mathematically more consistent with the definition of the real line and foundations of topology. It also provides a quantitative measure of the cardinality of $N \times N$ relative to that of N. Similar arguments show that the set of rational numbers is not countable. This article suggests that the axiom of choice is a more rigorous technique to prove the existence theorems for connection and metric on the spacetime manifold than the usual application of second-countability.</description>
