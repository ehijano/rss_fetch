      <title>Dynamics of multidimensional fundamental and vortex solitons in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of fundamental and vortex solitons in the framework of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the spatial dimension $D\geqslant 2$ with a multiplicative random term depending on the time and space coordinates. To this end, we develop a new technique for calculating the even moments of the $N$th order. The proposed formalism does not use closure procedures for the nonlinear term, as well as the smallness of the random term and the use of perturbation theory. The essential point is the quadratic form of the autocorrelation function of the random field and the special stochastic change of variables. Using variational analysis to determine the field of structures in the deterministic case, we analytically calculate a number of statistical characteristics describing the dynamics of fundamental and vortex solitons in random medium, such as the mean intensities, the variance of the intensity, the centroid and spread of the structures, the spatial mutual coherence function etc. In particular, we show that, under the irreversible action of fluctuations, the solitons spread out, i.e., no collapse occurs.</description>

      <title>Restricted baby Skyrme-Maxwell theory in a magnetic medium: BPS configurations and some properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of BPS configurations in a restricted baby Skyrme-Maxwell enlarged via the inclusion of a nontrivial magnetic permeability. In order to attain such a goal, we use the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield prescription, which allows us to obtain the lower bound for the energy and the BPS equations whose [electrically neutral] solutions saturate that bound. During the energy minimization procedure, we find a differential constraint which involves the self-dual potential, the superpotential itself and also the magnetic permeability. In order to solve the BPS system, we focus our attention on those solutions with rotational symmetry. For that, we fix the magnetic permeability and select two BPS potentials which exhibit a similar behavior near to the vacuum. We depict the resulting profiles and proceed to an analytical description of the properties of the BPS magnetic field. Furthermore, we consider some essential aspects of our model, such as the conditions for the overall existence of the BPS solutions, and how the permeability affects the magnetic flux. Finally, we present a family of exact BPS solutions.</description>

      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
