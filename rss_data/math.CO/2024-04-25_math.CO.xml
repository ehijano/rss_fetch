      <title>Constructions of Spherical 3-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical t-designs are Chebyshev-type averaging sets on the d-sphere S^d which are exact for polynomials of degree at most t. This concept was introduced in 1977 by Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel, who also found the minimum possible size of such designs, in particular, that the number of points in a 3-design on S^d must be at least n&gt;=2d+2. In this paper we give explicit constructions for spherical 3-designs on S^d consisting of n points for d=1 and n&gt;=4; d=2 and n=6; 8; &gt;= 10; d=3 and n=8; &gt;=10; d = 4 and n = 10; 12; &gt;= 14; d&gt;=5 and n&gt;=5(d+1)/2 odd or n&gt;=2d+2 even. We also provide some evidence that 3-designs of other sizes do not exist.</description>

      <title>Modular Forms in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), find applications across various domains including logistics, genome sequencing, and robotics. Despite their extensive applications, there have not been significant advancements in deriving optimal solutions for these problems. The lack of theoretical understanding owing to the complex structure of these problems has hindered the development of sophisticated algorithms. This paper proposes an unconventional approach by translating the ATSP into the complex domain, revealing an intrinsic modular nature of the problem. Furthermore, we have exploited modularity conditions to gain deeper insights into both unconstrained and constrained optimal solutions. The theoretical framework laid out in this paper can lead to important results at the intersection of combinatorial optimization and number theory.</description>

      <title>The Stress-Flex Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proven that a tensegrity framework that arises from coning the one-skeleton of a convex polytope is rigid. Since such frameworks are not always infinitesimally rigid, this leaves open the question as to whether they are at least prestress stable. We prove here that this holds subject to an intriguing new conjecture about coned polytope frameworks, that we call the stress-flex conjecture. Multiple numerical experiments suggest that this conjecture is true, and most surprisingly, seems to hold even beyond convexity and also for higher genus~polytopes.</description>

      <title>Curvature, diameter and signs of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Li-Yau type eigenvalue-diameter estimate for signed graphs. That is, the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a non-negatively curved signed graph are lower bounded by $1/D^2$ up to a constant, where $D$ stands for the diameter. This leads to several interesting applications, including a volume estimate for non-negatively curved signed graphs in terms of frustration index and diameter, and a two-sided Li-Yau estimate for triangle-free graphs. Our proof is built upon a combination of Chung-Lin-Yau type gradient estimate and a new trick involving strong nodal domain walks of signed graphs. We further discuss extensions of part of our results to nonlinear Laplacians on signed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tutte proved that 4-connected planar graphs are Hamiltonian. It is unknown if there is an analogous result on 1-planar graphs. In this paper, we characterize 4-connected 1-planar chordal graphs, and show that all such graphs are Hamiltonian-connected. A crucial tool used in our proof is a characteristic of 1-planar 4-trees.</description>

      <title>Parity of the coefficients of certain eta-quotients, III: The case of pure eta-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue a program of investigating the parity of the coefficients of eta-quotients, with the goal of elucidating the parity of the partition function. In this paper, we consider positive integer powers $t$ of the Dedekind eta-function. Previous work and conjectures suggest that arithmetic progressions in which the Fourier coefficients of these functions are even should be numerous. We explicitly identify infinite classes of such progressions modulo prime squares for several values of $t$, and we offer two broad conjectures concerning their existence in general.</description>

      <title>Toric wedge induction and toric lifting property for piecewise linear spheres with a few vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an $(n-1)$-dimensional piecewise linear sphere on $[m]$, where $m\leq n+4$. There are a canonical action of $m$-dimensional torus $T^m$ on the moment-angle complex $\mathcal{Z}_K$, and a canonical action of $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ on the real moment-angle complex $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{Z}_K$, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the additive group with two elements. We prove that any subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ acting freely on $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{Z}_K$ is induced by a subtorus of $T^m$ acting freely on $\mathcal{Z}_K$. The proof primarily utilizes a suitably modified method of toric wedge induction and the combinatorial structure of a specific binary matroid of rank $4$.</description>

      <title>Critical beta-splitting, via contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree of poly-logarithmic height. Recently, by a technical analysis, Aldous and Pittel proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height $H_n$ of a random leaf.
  We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These techniques were developed by Neininger and R\"uschendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the first two moments of $H_n$, with great precision. We show that a limit theorem follows, and bound the distance from normality.</description>

      <title>Kings and Kernels in Semicomplete Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.05607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an integer with $k\geq 2$. A $k$-king in a digraph $D$ is a vertex which can reach every other vertex by a directed path of length at most $k$ and a non-king is a vertex which is not a 3-king. A subset $K$ is $k$-independent if for every pair of vertices $x,y \in K$, we have $d_D(x, y), d_D(y, x)\geq k$; it is $\ell$-absorbent if for every $x\in V(D)\setminus K$ there exists $y\in K$ such that $d_D(x, y)\leq \ell$. A $k$-kernel of $D$ is a $k$-independent and $(k-1)$-absorbent subset of $V(D)$. A kernel is a 2-kernel. A set $K\subseteq V(D)$ is a quasi-kernel of $D$ if it is independent, and for every vertex $x\in V(D)\setminus K$, there exists $y\in K$ such that $d_D(x, y)\leq 2$. The problem {\sc $k$-Kernel} is determining whether a given digraph has a $k$-kernel.
  Let $Q=T[H_1, \dots, H_t]$ be the composition of $T$ and $H_i$ ($1\leq i\leq t, t\ge 2$), where $T$ is a digraph with $t$ vertices, and $H_1, \dots, H_t$ are pairwise disjoint digraphs. The composition $Q=T[H_1, \dots, H_t]$ is a semicomplete composition if $T$ is semicomplete. In this paper, we study kings and kernels in semicomplete compositions.
  For the topic of kings, we characterize digraph compositions with a $k$-king and digraph compositions all of whose vertices are $k$-kings, respectively. We also discuss the existence of 3-kings, and study the minimum number of 4-kings in a strong semicomplete composition.
  For the topic of kernels, we first study the existence of a pair of disjoint quasi-kernels in semicomplete compositions. We then deduce that the problem {\sc $k$-Kernel} restricted to strong semicomplete compositions is NP-complete when $k\in \{2,3\}$, and is polynomial-time solvable when $k\geq 4$. We also prove that when $k$ is divisible by 2 or 3, the problem {\sc $k$-Kernel} restricted to non-strong semicomplete compositions is NP-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional permutations, or $d$-permutations, are represented by their diagrams on $[n]^d$ such that there exists exactly one point per hyperplane $x_i$ that satisfies $x_i= j$ for $i \in [d]$ and $j \in [n]$. Bonichon and Morel previously enumerated $3$-permutations avoiding small patterns, and we extend their results by first proving four conjectures, which exhaustively enumerate $3$-permutations avoiding any two fixed patterns of size $3$. We further provide a enumerative result relating $3$-permutation avoidance classes with their respective recurrence relations. In particular, we show a recurrence relation for $3$-permutations avoiding the patterns $132$ and $213$, which contributes a new sequence to the OEIS database. We then extend our results to completely enumerate $3$-permutations avoiding three patterns of size $3$.</description>

      <title>A Complete Enumeration of Ballot Permutations Avoiding Sets of Small Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutations whose prefixes contain at least as many ascents as descents are called ballot permutations. Lin, Wang, and Zhao have previously enumerated ballot permutations avoiding small patterns and have proposed the problem of enumerating ballot permutations avoiding a pair of permutations of length $3$. We completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding two patterns of length $3$ and we relate these avoidance classes with their respective recurrence relations and formulas, which leads to an interesting bijection between ballot permutations avoiding $132$ and $312$ with left factors of Dyck paths. In addition, we also conclude the Wilf-classification of ballot permutations avoiding sets of two patterns of length $3$, and we then extend our results to completely enumerate ballot permutations avoiding three patterns of length $3$.</description>

      <title>Ordered unavoidable sub-structures in matchings and random matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14042v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered matching of size $n$ is a graph on a linearly ordered vertex set $V$, $|V|=2n$, consisting of $n$ pairwise disjoint edges. There are three different ordered matchings of size two on $V=\{1,2,3,4\}$: an alignment $\{1,2\},\{3,4\}$, a nesting $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$, and a crossing $\{1,3\},\{2,4\}$. Accordingly, there are three basic homogeneous types of ordered matchings (with all pairs of edges arranged in the same way) which we call, respectively, lines, stacks, and waves.
  We prove an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type result guaranteeing in every ordered matching of size $n$ the presence of one of the three basic sub-structures of a given size. In particular, one of them must be of size at least $n^{1/3}$. We also investigate the size of each of the three sub-structures in a random ordered matching. Additionally, the former result is generalized to $3$-uniform ordered matchings.
  Another type of unavoidable patterns we study are twins, that is, pairs of order-isomorphic, disjoint sub-matchings. By relating to a similar problem for permutations, we prove that the maximum size of twins that occur in every ordered matching of size $n$ is $O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ and $\Omega\left(n^{3/5}\right)$. We conjecture that the upper bound is the correct order of magnitude and confirm it for almost all matchings. In fact, our results for twins are proved more generally for $r$-multiple twins, $r\ge2$.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems via Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15492v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of analytic combinatorics is dedicated to the creation of effective techniques to study the large-scale behaviour of combinatorial objects. Although classical results in analytic combinatorics are mainly concerned with univariate generating functions, over the last two decades a theory of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) has been developed to study the asymptotic behaviour of multivariate sequences. In this work we survey ACSV from a probabilistic perspective, illustrating how its most advanced methods provide efficient algorithms to derive limit theorems, and comparing the results to past work deriving combinatorial limit theorems. Using the results of ACSV, we provide a SageMath package that can automatically compute (and rigorously verify) limit theorems for a large variety of combinatorial generating functions. To illustrate the techniques involved, we also establish explicit local central limit theorems for a family of combinatorial classes whose generating functions are linear in the variables tracking each parameter. Applications covered by this result include the distribution of cycles in certain restricted permutations (proving a limit theorem stated as a conjecture in recent work of Chung et al.), integer compositions, and $n$-colour compositions with varying restrictions and values tracked. Key to establishing these explicit results in arbitrary dimension is an interesting symbolic determinant, which we compute by conjecturing and then proving an appropriate $LU$-factorization. It is our hope that this work provides readers a blueprint to apply the powerful tools of ACSV to prove central limit theorems in their own work, making them more accessible to combinatorialists, probabilists, and those in adjacent fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent work of Mattheus and Verstra\"ete, we establish a general connection between Ramsey numbers of the form $r(F,t)$ for $F$ a fixed graph and a variant of the Zarankiewicz problem asking for the maximum number of 1s in an $m$ by $n$ $0/1$-matrix that does not have any matrix from a fixed finite family $\mathcal{L}(F)$ derived from $F$ as a submatrix. As an application, we give new lower bounds for the Ramsey numbers $r(C_5,t)$ and $r(C_7,t)$, namely, $r(C_5,t) = \tilde\Omega(t^{\frac{10}{7}})$ and $r(C_7,t) = \tilde\Omega(t^{\frac{5}{4}})$. We also show how the truth of a plausible conjecture about Zarankiewicz numbers would allow an approximate determination of $r(C_{2\ell+1}, t)$ for any fixed integer $\ell \geq 2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The positive and negative square energies of a graph, $s^+(G)$ and $s^-(G)$, are the sums of squares of the positive and negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, respectively. The first results on square energies revealed symmetry between $s^+(G)$ and $s^-(G)$. This paper reviews examples of asymmetry between these parameters, for example using large random graphs and the ratios $s^+/s^-$ and $s^-/s^+$, as well as new examples of symmetry. We answer some questions previously asked about $s^{+}$ and $s^{-}$ and suggest several further avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the projective plane to two incidence-rich parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An internal or friendly partition of a vertex set $V(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a partition to two nonempty sets $A\cup B$ such that every vertex has at least as many neighbours in its own class as in the other one. Motivated by Diwan's existence proof on internal partitions of graphs with high girth, we give constructive proofs for the existence of internal partitions in the incidence graph of projective planes and discuss its geometric properties. In addition, we determine exactly the maximum possible difference between the sizes of the neighbor set in its own class and the neighbor set of the other class, that can be attained for all vertices at the same time for the incidence graphs of desarguesian planes of square order.</description>

      <title>Tutte polynomials of matroids as universal valuative invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a full classification of all families of matroids that are closed under duality and minors, and for which the Tutte polynomial is a universal valuative invariant. There are four inclusion-wise maximal families, two of which are the class of elementary split matroids and the class of graphic Schubert matroids. As a consequence of our framework, we derive new properties of Tutte polynomials of arbitrary matroids. Among other results, we show that the Tutte polynomial of every matroid can be expressed uniquely as an integral combination of Tutte polynomials of graphic Schubert matroids.</description>

      <title>On reduced unicellular hypermonopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of counting unicellular hypermonopoles by the number of their hyperedges is equivalent to describing the cycle length distribution of a product of two circular permutations, first solved by Zagier. The solution of this problem has also been used in the study of the cycle graph model of Bafna and Pevzner and of related models in mathematical biology. In this paper we develop a method to compute the finite number of reduced unicellular hypermonopoles of a given genus. The problem of representing any hypermap as a drawing is known to be simplifiable to solving the same problem for reduced unicellular hypermonopoles. We also outline a correspondence between our hypermap model, the cycle graph model of Bafna and Pevzner, and the polygon gluing model of Alexeev and Zograf. Reduced unicellular hypermonopoles correspond to reduced objects in the other models as well, and the notion of genus is the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symplectic/orthogonal contents of partitions are related to the dimensions of irreducible representations of symplectic/orthogonal groups. In 2012, motivated by Nekrasov-Okounkov's hook-length formula and Stanley's hook-content formula, Amdeberhan proposed several conjectures about infinite product formulas for certain generating functions of hook-lengths and symplectic/orthogonal contents. Some special cases of his conjectures were recently proved by Amdeberhan, Andrews and Ballantine. In this paper, we prove the general cases of Amdeberhan's conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a nonempty set of positive integers. The restricted partition function $p_A(n)$ denotes the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A$. When the elements in $A$ are pairwise relatively prime positive integers, Ehrhart, Sert\"oz-\"Ozl\"uk, and Brown-Chou-Shiue derived three reduction formulas for $p_A(n)$ for $A$ with three parameters. We extend their findings for general $A$ using the Bernoulli-Barnes polynomials.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition for random forests in $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The arboreal gas is the probability measure on (unrooted spanning) forests of a graph in which each forest is weighted by a factor $\beta&gt;0$ per edge. It arises as the $q\to 0$ limit of the $q$-state random cluster model with $p=\beta q$. We prove that in dimensions $d\geq 3$ the arboreal gas undergoes a percolation phase transition. This contrasts with the case of $d=2$ where no percolation transition occurs.
  The starting point for our analysis is an exact relationship between the arboreal gas and a non-linear sigma model with target space the fermionic hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$. This latter model can be thought of as the $0$-state Potts model, with the arboreal gas being its random cluster representation. Unlike the standard Potts models, the $\mathbb{H}^{0|2}$ model has continuous symmetries. By combining a renormalisation group analysis with Ward identities we prove that this symmetry is spontaneously broken at low temperatures. In terms of the arboreal gas, this symmetry breaking translates into the existence of infinite trees in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis also establishes massless free field correlations at low temperatures and the existence of a macroscopic tree on finite tori.</description>

      <title>Maximum Cut on Interval Graphs of Interval Count Two is NP-complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An interval graph has interval count $\ell$ if it has an interval model, where among every $\ell+1$ intervals there are two that have the same length. Maximum Cut on interval graphs has been found to be NP-complete recently by Adhikary et al. while deciding its complexity on unit interval graphs (graphs with interval count one) remains a longstanding open problem. More recently, de Figueiredo et al. have made an advancement by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on interval graphs of interval count four. In this paper, we show that Maximum Cut is NP-complete even on interval graphs of interval count two.</description>

Abstract: We describe the twisted $K$-polynomial of multiplicity-free varieties in a multiprojective setting. More precisely, for multiplicity-free varieties, we show that the support of the twisted $K$-polynomial is a generalized polymatroid. As applications, we show that the support of the M\"obius function of a linear polymatroid is a generalized polymatroid, and we settle a conjecture of Monical, Tokcan and Yong regarding Grothendieck polynomials for the case of zero-one Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note we develop new methods toward the ultimate goal of classifying geproci sets in $\mathbb P^3$. We apply these methods to show that among sets of $16$ points distributed evenly on $4$ skew lines, up to projective equivalence there are only two distinct geproci sets. We give different geometric distinctions between these sets. The methods we develop here can be applied in a more general set-up; this is the context of the follow-up work arXiv:2308.00761.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of enumeration in certain genome rearrangement models. We first show that the Pairwise Rearrangement problem in the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010) is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete under polynomial-time Turing reductions. Next, we show that in the Single Cut or Join model (Feijao &amp; Meidanis, IEEE ACM Trans. Comp. Biol. Bioinf. 2011), the problem of enumerating all medians ($\#$Median) is logspace-computable ($\textsf{FL}$), improving upon the previous polynomial-time ($\textsf{FP}$) bound of Mikl\'os &amp; Smith (RECOMB 2015).</description>

      <title>Ghost Value Augmentation for $k$-Edge-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a poly-time algorithm for the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem that returns a solution of cost no greater than the cheapest $(k+10)$-ECSS on the same graph. Our approach enhances the iterative relaxation framework with a new ingredient, which we call ghost values, that allows for high sparsity in intermediate problems.
  Our guarantees improve upon the best-known approximation factor of $2$ for $k$-ECSS whenever the optimal value of $(k+10)$-ECSS is close to that of $k$-ECSS. This is a property that holds for the closely related problem $k$-edge-connected spanning multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM), which is identical to $k$-ECSS except edges can be selected multiple times at the same cost. As a consequence, we obtain a $\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-ECSM, which resolves a conjecture of Pritchard and improves upon a recent $\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm of Karlin, Klein, Oveis Gharan, and Zhang. Moreover, we present a matching lower bound for $k$-ECSM, showing that our approximation ratio is tight up to the constant factor in $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$, unless $P=NP$.</description>

      <title>On the Constant-Depth Circuit Complexity of Generating Quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-depth circuit complexity of the Isomorphism Problem, Minimum Generating Set Problem (MGS), and Sub(quasi)group Membership Problem (Membership) for groups and quasigroups (=Latin squares), given as input in terms of their multiplication (Cayley) tables. Despite decades of research on these problems, lower bounds for these problems even against depth-$2$ AC circuits remain unknown. Perhaps surprisingly, Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, and Wagner (FSTTCS 2010; ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 2013) showed that Quasigroup Isomorphism could be solved by AC circuits of depth $O(\log \log n)$ using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits, a class we denote $\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL$. We narrow this gap by improving the upper bound for many of these problems to $quasiAC^0$, thus decreasing the depth to constant.
  In particular, we show:
  - MGS for quasigroups is in $\exists^{\log^2(n)}\forall^{\log n}NTIME(\mathrm{polylog}(n))\subseteq quasiAC^0$. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1996) conjectured that this problem was $\exists^{\log^2(n)}P$-complete; our results refute a version of that conjecture for completeness under $quasiAC^0$ reductions unconditionally, and under polylog-space reductions assuming EXP $\neq$ PSPACE.
  - MGS for groups is in $AC^{1}(L)$, improving on the previous upper bound of $P$ (Lucchini &amp; Thakkar, J. Algebra, 2024).
  - Quasigroup Isomorphism belongs to $\exists^{\log^2(n)}AC^0(DTISP(\mathrm{polylog},\log)\subseteq quasiAC^0$, improving on the previous bound of $\exists^{\log^2(n)}L\cap\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL\subseteq quasiFOLL$ (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, &amp; Wagner, ibid.; Levet, Australas. J. Combin., 2023).
  Our results suggest that understanding the constant-depth circuit complexity may be key to resolving the complexity of problems concerning (quasi)groups in the multiplication table model.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the (random) total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached. In particular, we prove that it centers around $\frac{2}{7}n\ln n$ and that it has variations linear in $n$, whose distribution we can describe explicitly.</description>

      <title>Faithlessness in Gaussian graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implication problem for conditional independence (CI) asks whether the fact that a probability distribution obeys a given finite set of CI relations implies that a further CI statement also holds in this distribution. This problem has a long and fascinating history, cumulating in positive results about implications now known as the semigraphoid axioms as well as impossibility results about a general finite characterization of CI implications. Motivated by violation of faithfulness assumptions in causal discovery, we study the implication problem in the special setting where the CI relations are obtained from a directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model along with one additional CI statement. Focusing on the Gaussian case, we give a complete characterization of when such an implication is graphical by using algebraic techniques. Moreover, prompted by the relevance of strong faithfulness in statistical guarantees for causal discovery algorithms, we give a graphical solution for an approximate CI implication problem, in which we ask whether small values of one additional partial correlation entail small values for yet a further partial correlation.</description>
