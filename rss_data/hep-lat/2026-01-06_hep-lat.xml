      <title>$I=\frac{3}{2}$ $\pi K$ $s$-wave scattering length from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $I=\frac{3}{2}$ $\pi K$ $s$-wave scattering phase shift is computed by lattice quantum chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavors of Asqtad-improved staggered fermions. The energy-eigenvalues of $\pi K$ systems at one center of mass frame and six moving frames using moving wall source technique are used to get phase shifts by L\"uscher's formula and its extensions. The calculations are good enough to acquire effective range expansion parameters: scattering length $a$, effective range $r$, and shape parameter $P$, which are in good agreement with our explicit analytical predictions in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. All results are fairly consistent with experimental measurements, phenomenological studies, and lattice estimations. Numerical computations are implemented at a fine ($a\approx0.082$ fm, $L^3 T = 40^3 96$) lattice ensemble with physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Tori, Klein Bottles, and Modulo 8 Parity/Time-reversal Anomalies of 2+1d Staggered Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetries of lattice staggered fermions in 2+1d. Using the symmetries, we can place the system on any sheared torus or Klein bottle. These different backgrounds provide diagnostics of various 't Hooft anomalies associated with the crystalline symmetries. We then compare the lattice model to its continuum limit. The symmetries of the lattice system are mapped in a nontrivial way to the symmetries of the continuum theories. Using this map, we match the 't Hooft anomalies on the lattice and the continuum. Along the way, we develop a general formalism to study Hamiltonian lattice models on nontrivial, compact, flat spaces.</description>

      <title>Investigating $\Omega \phi$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interaction between the $\Omega$ baryon and the $s\bar{s}$ meson within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model. The spectra calculations show that no bound state is formed in any of the considered channels, while the scattering indicates that the $\Omega\phi$ interaction with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ is weakly attractive. As for the $\Omega\phi$ interactions with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$, as well as the $\Omega\eta^{\prime}$ interaction with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$, they are all repulsive. After an investigation on the femtoscopic correlation functions, we find that, due to the spin-averaging effect, the overall $\Omega\phi$ correlation function exhibits a weak dependence on the source size, which provides a crucial significance of our model for future experimental examinations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Wilson-'t Hooft classification and the perimeter law for dyonic loops in 3d monopole semiclassics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $\theta=\pi$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of cosmological particle production: interacting quantum field theories with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N&gt;3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to explore a uniform range of lattice spacings across all values of $N$, and to precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the mixed-fermion-action Effects using different fermion and gauge actions with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading-order low-energy constant $\Delta_{\rm mix}$ in mixed-action chiral perturbation theory is calculated using $2+1+1$-flavor gauge ensembles with HISQ fermions and a tadpole-improved Symanzik gauge action at four lattice spacings $a \in [0.048, 0.111]$ fm. By comparing our results to those from different actions and a $2+1$-flavor case, We find that the fermion action has the dominant impact, the gauge action has a secondary but measurable effect, and the contribution from charm quark loops is negligible within our current uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear beta decay using lattice quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} calculation of nuclear $\beta$ decay within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT), employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods to solve the nuclear many-body problem. Our approach combines next-to-next-to-leading order two- and three-body chiral interactions with one- and two-body axial current operators, all consistently derived in chiral effective field theory. Low-energy constants are determined exclusively from nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and few-body observables for systems with $A \leq 3$. Using these interactions and transition operators, we perform two-channel Monte Carlo simulations to compute the $\beta$-decay matrix element for $^6$He, obtaining results in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. To address the Monte Carlo sign problem, we implement a perturbative expansion around a leading-order Hamiltonian with approximate Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. This systematic approach provides a foundation for extending NLEFT simulations to precision studies of weak processes in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>Sign-Problem-Free Nuclear Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods offer exact solutions for quantum many-body systems but face severe limitations in fermionic systems like atomic nuclei due to the sign problem. While sign-problem-free QMC algorithms exist and provide valuable insights across disciplines, they have been restricted to simple models with limited quantitative predictive power. Here we overcome this barrier by developing a novel lattice nuclear force that is rigorously sign-problem-free for even-even nuclei. This interaction achieves a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.932$ MeV from experimental binding energies for 76 even-even nuclei ($N,Z \leq 28$), matching state-of-the-art phenomenological mean-field models. Key innovations include the first sign-problem-free implementation of spin-orbit coupling for shell evolutions and an efficient QMC-optimized framework for global parameter fitting. Using this approach, we compute binding energies from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn with unprecedented one-thousandth level numerical precision, reproduce symmetric nuclear matter saturation, and reveal novel spin-orbit-driven clustering in light nuclei. This work transforms sign-problem-free QMC into a scalable and predictive nuclear structure tool, while establishing a high-fidelity, non-perturbative foundation for \textit{ab initio} calculations of heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric lattice theories on curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to construct Hamiltonian lattice theories with one exact supersymmetry on arbitrary triangulations of curved space in any number of dimensions. Both bosons and fermions satisfy discrete K\"{a}hler-Dirac equations. The quantization of the fermions proceeds by imposing conventional anti-commutation relations while the bosons require a modification of the usual canonical commutator. On regular lattices we construct parity, time reversal and translation-by-one (shift) symmetries. We argue that the latter are generically non-invertible symmetries. We also show how to couple these degrees of freedom to background gauge fields which leads to a theory with enhanced supersymmetry.</description>
