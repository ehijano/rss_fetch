      <title>Applications of Induced Tensor Norms to Guidance Navigation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear methods are ubiquitous for control and estimation problems. In this work, we present a number of tensor operator norms as a means to approximately bound the error associated with linear methods and determine the situations in which that maximum error is encountered. An emphasis is placed on induced norms that can be computed in terms of matrix or tensor eigenvalues associated with coefficient tensors from higher-order Taylor series. These operator norms can be used to understand the performance and range of applicability of an algorithm exploiting linear approximations in different sets of coordinates. We examine uses of tensor operator norms in the context of linear and higher-order rendezvous guidance, coordinate selection for a filtering measurement model, and to present a unified treatment of nonlinearity indices for dynamical systems. Tensor norm computations can offer insights into these problems in one to two orders of magnitude less time than similarly accurate sampling methods while providing more general understanding of the error performance of linear or higher-order approximations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the origins of switching dynamics in a multifunctional reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of multifunctionality has enabled reservoir computers (RCs), a type of dynamical system that is typically realised as an artificial neural network, to reconstruct multiple attractors simultaneously using the same set of trained weights. However there are many additional phenomena that arise when training a RC to reconstruct more than one attractor. Previous studies have found that, in certain cases, if the RC fails to reconstruct a coexistence of attractors then it exhibits a form of metastability whereby, without any external input, the state of the RC switches between different modes of behaviour that resemble properties of the attractors it failed to reconstruct. In this paper we explore the origins of these switching dynamics in a paradigmatic setting via the `seeing double' problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a system of particles subject to a 4th order potential field modeling the space-time evolution of wedge disclinations is studied, focusing on finite systems of disclinations within a circular domain. Existence theorems for the trajectories of these disclinations are presented, considering both the dynamics without predefined preferred directions of motion in an isotropic medium and the dynamics in which the disclinations move parallel to predefined directions, modeling a crystalline material. The analysis is illustrated with a number of numerical solutions to demonstrate various relevant configurations.</description>

      <title>Sigma Flows for Image and Data Labeling and Learning Structured Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the sigma flow model for the prediction of structured labelings of data observed on Riemannian manifolds, including Euclidean image domains as special case. The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework for image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi about 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by the authors.
  The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic energies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical manifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A specific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the Riemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the approach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this dependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can be learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity of the sigma flow model and prediction performance.
  Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks generated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which highlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the use of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Conformal Disentanglement: A Neural Framework for Perspective Synthesis and Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For multiple scientific endeavors it is common to measure a phenomenon of interest in more than one ways. We make observations of objects from several different perspectives in space, at different points in time; we may also measure different properties of a mixture using different types of instruments. After collecting this heterogeneous information, it is necessary to be able to synthesize a complete picture of what is `common' across its sources: the subject we ultimately want to study. However, isolated (`clean') observations of a system are not always possible: observations often contain information about other systems in its environment, or about the measuring instruments themselves. In that sense, each observation may contain information that `does not matter' to the original object of study; this `uncommon' information between sensors observing the same object may still be important, and decoupling it from the main signal(s) useful. We introduce a neural network autoencoder framework capable of both tasks: it is structured to identify `common' variables, and, making use of orthogonality constraints to define geometric independence, to also identify disentangled `uncommon' information originating from the heterogeneous sensors. We demonstrate applications in several computational examples.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Stiff Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a stability analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) coupled with random projections, for the numerical solution of (stiff) linear differential equations. For our analysis, we consider systems of linear ODEs, and linear parabolic PDEs. We prove that properly designed PINNs offer consistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent schemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation random projection PINNs guarantee asymptotic stability for very high stiffness and that single-collocation PINNs are $A$-stable. To assess the performance of the PINNs in terms of both numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, we compare it with other implicit schemes and in particular backward Euler, the midpoint, trapezoidal (Crank-Nikolson), the 2-stage Gauss scheme and the 2 and 3 stages Radau schemes. We show that the proposed PINNs outperform the above traditional schemes, in both numerical approximation accuracy and importantly computational cost, for a wide range of step sizes.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Overparametrized LQR Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper takes the first steps towards bridging the gap between results from Direct Gradient methods for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), and neural networks. More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a Linear Feed-Forward Neural Network (LFFNN) feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by computing the gradient formulas for the parameters of each layer, which are used to derive a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to prove boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer. For this case, the paper proves that the training converges not only to critical points but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of measure-zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem (the ``vector case''), proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and robustness for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to traditional direct gradient methods, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.</description>

      <title>Counting rational maps on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with prescribed local conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore distribution questions for rational maps on the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ within the framework of arithmetic dynamics, drawing analogies to elliptic curves. Specifically, we investigate counting problems for rational maps $\phi$ of fixed degree $d \geq 2$ with prescribed reduction properties. Our main result establishes that the set of rational maps with minimal resultant has positive density. Additionally, for degree 2 rational maps, we perform explicit computations demonstrating that over $32.7\%$ possess a squarefree, and hence minimal, resultant.</description>

      <title>A Generalized L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15683v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous L\'{e}vy-Khintchine theorem is a beautiful limiting law for the denominators of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of a real number. In a recent breakthrough, Cheung and Chevallier (Annales scientifiques de l'ENS, 2024) extended this theorem to higher dimensions. In this paper, we consider multiple generalizations of the definition of the best approximates of a matrix and prove analogues of the L\'{e}vy-Khintchine theorem for all these generalizations. A special case of our theorem answers a question posed by Cheung and Chevallier about L\'{e}vy-Khintchine type theorems for arbitrary norms. Another notable instance of our results resolves a conjecture of Yitwah Cheung. While our findings are new for higher dimensions, even in the one-dimensional case our work is a significant improvement over available results. Notably, we extend the results of Cheung and Chevallier by proving their theorems for any Birkhoff generic point and by permitting the best approximates to satisfy additional geometric and arithmetic conditions. Moreover, our main theorem, from which the above results follow, also extends the recent work of Shapira and Weiss.</description>

      <title>A review of sequential Monte Carlo methods for real-time disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo methods are a powerful framework for approximating the posterior distribution of a state variable in a sequential manner. They provide an attractive way of analyzing dynamic systems in real-time, taking into account the limitations of traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which are not well suited to data that arrives incrementally. This paper reviews and explores the application of Sequential Monte Carlo in dynamic disease modeling, highlighting its capacity for online inference and real-time adaptation to evolving disease dynamics. The integration of kernel density approximation techniques within the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartment model is examined, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in monitoring time-varying parameters such as the effective reproduction number. Case studies, including simulations with synthetic data and analysis of real-world COVID-19 data from Ireland, demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach for informing timely public health interventions.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for polynomial volume growth of automorphisms of zero entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a normal projective variety of dimension $d$ over an algebraically closed field and $f$ an automorphism of $X$. Suppose that the pullback $f^*|_{\mathsf{N}^1(X)_\mathbf{R}}$ of $f$ on the real N\'eron--Severi space $\mathsf{N}^1(X)_\mathbf{R}$ is unipotent and denote the index of the eigenvalue $1$ by $k+1$. We prove an upper bound for the polynomial volume growth $\mathrm{plov}(f)$ of $f$ as follows: \[ \mathrm{plov}(f) \le (k/2 + 1)d. \] This inequality is optimal in certain cases. Furthermore, we show that $k\le 2(d-1)$, extending a result of Dinh--Lin--Oguiso--Zhang for compact K\"ahler manifolds to arbitrary characteristic. Combining these two inequalities together, we obtain an optimal inequality that \[ \mathrm{plov}(f) \le d^2, \] which affirmatively answers questions of Cantat--Paris-Romaskevich and Lin--Oguiso--Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems that capture their long-term dynamics. In this work, we focus on the criteria of lumpability and decomposability, previously established for assessing RCs, and propose a new flow matching approach for the analysis and optimization of reaction coordinates based on these criteria. This method effectively utilizes data to quantitatively determine whether a given RC satisfies these criteria and enables end-to-end optimization of the reaction coordinate mapping model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the loss function used in our approach and the operator error induced by dimension reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1902.07440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an integral combinatorial characterization of pseudo-Anosov maps on closed oriented surfaces of genus g &gt; 1. We show that an orientation-preserving pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism with orientable foliations and fixing all critical trajectories can be encoded as a permutation of 2g+v-1 positive integers, where v is the number of singular points of the foliations (disregarding multiplicity). We call such a permutations an ordered block permutation (OBP), and it satisfies an admissiblity condition. Conversely, we show that a surface along with measured foliations (up to scaling) and the pseudo-Anosov map can be uniquely constructed out of the data of an admissible permutation of 2g+v-1 positive integers. In particular, for closed surfaces, we construct every orientable foliation invariant under a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Renormalization in Lorenz maps -- completely invariant sets and periodic orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with dynamics of expanding Lorenz maps, which appear in a natural way as Poincar\`e maps in geometric models of well-known Lorenz attractor. Using both analytical and symbolic approaches, we study connections between periodic points, completely invariant sets and renormalizations. We show that some renormalizations may be connected with completely invariant sets while some others don't. We provide an algorithm to detect the renormalizations that can be recovered from completely invariant sets. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of distinguish one-side and double-side preimage. This way we provide a better insight into the structure of renormalizations in Lorenz maps. These relations remained unnoticed in the literature, therefore we are correcting some gaps existing in the literature, improving and completing to some extent the description of possible dynamics in this important field of study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an analog in the context of rational maps of the idea of hyperbolic Dehn surgery from the theory of Kleinian groups. A surgery sequence is a sequence of postcritically finite maps limiting (in a precise manner) to a postcritically finite map with at least one strictly preperiodic critical orbit. As an application of this idea we give a new and elementary proof of Tan Lei's theorem on the asymptotic self-similarity of Julia Sets and the Mandelbrot Set at Misiurewicz points.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bifurcations: Periodicity from Eliminating a Line of Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new mechanism that triggers periodic orbits in smooth dynamical systems. To this end, we introduce the concept of hybrid bifurcations: Such bifurcations occur when a line of equilibria with an exchange point of normal stability vanishes. Our main result is the existence and stability criteria of periodic orbits that bifurcate from breaking a line of equilibria. As an application, we obtain stable periodic coexistent solutions in an ecosystem for two competing predators with Holling's type II functional response.</description>

      <title>Continuation of Periodic Orbits in Conservative Hybrid Dynamical Systems and its Application to Mechanical Systems with Impulsive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous differential equations where a single first integral is present, periodic orbits are well-known to belong to one-parameter families, parameterized by the first integral's values. This paper shows that this characteristic extends to a broader class of conservative hybrid dynamical systems (cHDSs). We study periodic orbits of a cHDS, introducing the concept of a hybrid first integral to characterize conservation in these systems. Additionally, our work presents a methodology that utilizes numerical continuation methods to generate these periodic orbits, building upon the concept of normal periodic orbits introduced by Sepulchre and MacKay (1997). We specifically compare state-based and time-based implementations of an cHDS as an important application detail in generating periodic orbits. Furthermore, we showcase the continuation process using exemplary conservative mechanical systems with impulsive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

      <title>Exact output tracking in prescribed finite time via funnel control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Output reference tracking of unknown nonlinear systems is considered. The control objective is exact tracking in predefined finite time, while in the transient phase the tracking error evolves within a prescribed boundary. To achieve this, a novel high-gain feedback controller is developed that is similar to, but extends, existing high-gain feedback controllers. Feasibility and functioning of the proposed controller is proven rigorously. Examples for the particular control objective under consideration are, for instance, linking up two train sections, or docking of spaceships.</description>

      <title>Counting and Joint equidistribution of approximates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of counting Diophantine inequalities with multiple natural constraints. We prove a very general result in this setting using dynamical techniques. More precisely, we consider the joint asymptotic distribution of $\varepsilon$-Diophantine approximates of matrices in several aspects. Our main results describe the resulting limiting measures for almost every matrix. Multiplicative Diophantine approximation is treated for the first time and a number of Diophantine corollaries are derived. While we treat the general case of approximation of matrices, our results are already new for the case of simultaneous Diophantine approximation of vectors. Our approach is dynamical and is based on the construction of an appropriate Poincar\'{e} section for certain diagonal group actions on the space of unimodular lattices along with multiple mixing. The main new idea in our paper is a method which allows us to treat actions of higher rank groups.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>
