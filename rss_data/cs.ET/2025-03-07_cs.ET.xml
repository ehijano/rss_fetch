      <title>Towards Intelligent Transportation with Pedestrians and Vehicles In-the-Loop: A Surveillance Video-Assisted Federated Digital Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), incorporating pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop is crucial for developing realistic and safe traffic management solutions. However, there is falls short of simulating complex real-world ITS scenarios, primarily due to the lack of a digital twin implementation framework for characterizing interactions between pedestrians and vehicles at different locations in different traffic environments. In this article, we propose a surveillance video assisted federated digital twin (SV-FDT) framework to empower ITSs with pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop. Specifically, SVFDT builds comprehensive pedestrian-vehicle interaction models by leveraging multi-source traffic surveillance videos. Its architecture consists of three layers: (i) the end layer, which collects traffic surveillance videos from multiple sources; (ii) the edge layer, responsible for semantic segmentation-based visual understanding, twin agent-based interaction modeling, and local digital twin system (LDTS) creation in local regions; and (iii) the cloud layer, which integrates LDTSs across different regions to construct a global DT model in realtime. We analyze key design requirements and challenges and present core guidelines for SVFDT's system implementation. A testbed evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing traffic management. Comparisons with traditional terminal-server frameworks highlight SV-FDT's advantages in mirroring delays, recognition accuracy, and subjective evaluation. Finally, we identify some open challenges and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical process for drug discovery and challenging due to the complexity and size of biomolecular systems, where the optimal binding configuration of a drug to a target protein is determined. Hybrid classical-quantum computing techniques offer a novel approach to address these challenges. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variations are hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and a promising tool for combinatorial optimization challenges. This paper presents a Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA) approach to molecular docking. Simulated quantum runs were conducted on a GPU cluster. We examined 14 and 17 nodes instances - to the best of our knowledge the biggest published instance is 12-node at Ding et al. and we present the results. Based on computational results, we conclude that binding interactions represent the anticipated exact solution. Additionally, as the size of the examined instance increases, the computational times exhibit a significant escalation.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Digital Twin Synchronization in Mobile Edge Networks with Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2\% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Task Offloading for Rotatable STAR-RIS-Enhanced Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can expand the coverage of mobile edge computing (MEC) services by reflecting and transmitting signals simultaneously, enabling full-space coverage. The orientation of the STAR-RIS plays a crucial role in optimizing the gain of received and transmitted signals, and a rotatable STAR-RIS offers potential enhancement for MEC systems. This paper investigates a rotatable STAR-RIS-assisted MEC system, operated under three protocols, namely energy splitting, mode switching, and time switching. The goal is to minimize energy consumption for multiple moving user devices through the joint optimization of STAR-RIS configurations, orientation, computation resource allocation, transmission power, and task offloading strategies. Considering the mobility of user devices, we model the original optimization problem as a sequential decision-making process across multiple time slots. The high-dimensional, highly coupled, and nonlinear nature makes it a challenging non-convex decision-making problem for traditional optimization algorithms. Therefore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is employed, specifically utilizing soft actor-critic algorithm to train the DRL model. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks in both convergence speed and energy efficiency, while reducing energy consumption by up to 52.7\% compared to the fixed STAR-RIS scheme. Among three operating protocols, the energy splitting yields the best performance.</description>

      <title>Passive Heart Rate Monitoring During Smartphone Use in Everyday Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of cardiovascular health and mortality, but tracking it longitudinally generally requires a wearable device, limiting its availability. We present PHRM, a deep learning system for passive heart rate (HR) and RHR measurements during everyday smartphone use, using facial video-based photoplethysmography. Our system was developed using 225,773 videos from 495 participants and validated on 185,970 videos from 205 participants in laboratory and free-living conditions, representing the largest validation study of its kind. Compared to reference electrocardiogram, PHRM achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) &lt; 10% for HR measurements across three skin tone groups of light, medium and dark pigmentation; MAPE for each skin tone group was non-inferior versus the others. Daily RHR measured by PHRM had a mean absolute error &lt; 5 bpm compared to a wearable HR tracker, and was associated with known risk factors. These results highlight the potential of smartphones to enable passive and equitable heart health monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid progress in quantum hardware and software, the need for verification of quantum systems becomes increasingly crucial. While model checking is a dominant and very successful technique for verifying classical systems, its application to quantum systems is still an underdeveloped research area. This paper advances the development of model checking quantum systems by providing efficient image computation algorithms for quantum transition systems, which play a fundamental role in model checking. In our approach, we represent quantum circuits as tensor networks and design algorithms by leveraging the properties of tensor networks and tensor decision diagrams. Our experiments demonstrate that our contraction partition-based algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency of image computation for quantum transition systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing can reduce the energy requirements of neural networks and holds the promise to `repatriate' AI workloads back from the cloud to the edge. However, training neural networks on neuromorphic hardware has remained elusive. Here, we instead present a pipeline for training spiking neural networks on GPUs, using the efficient event-driven Eventprop algorithm implemented in mlGeNN, and deploying them on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip. Our benchmarking on keyword spotting tasks indicates that there is almost no loss in accuracy between GPU and Loihi 2 implementations and that classifying a sample on Loihi 2 is up to 10X faster and uses 200X less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.</description>

      <title>Joint Masked Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning for Mining Interactions Between Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an instrumental means in elucidating the mechanisms underlying cellular operations, holding significant practical implications for the realms of pharmaceutical development and clinical treatment. Presently, the majority of research methods primarily concentrate on the analysis of amino acid sequences, while investigations predicated on protein structures remain in the nascent stages of exploration. Despite the emergence of several structure-based algorithms in recent years, these are still confronted with inherent challenges: (1) the extraction of intrinsic structural information of proteins typically necessitates the expenditure of substantial computational resources; (2) these models are overly reliant on seen protein data, struggling to effectively unearth interaction cues between unknown proteins. To further propel advancements in this domain, this paper introduces a novel PPI prediction method jointing masked reconstruction and contrastive learning, termed JmcPPI. This methodology dissects the PPI prediction task into two distinct phases: during the residue structure encoding phase, JmcPPI devises two feature reconstruction tasks and employs graph attention mechanism to capture structural information between residues; during the protein interaction inference phase, JmcPPI perturbs the original PPI graph and employs a multi-graph contrastive learning strategy to thoroughly mine extrinsic interaction information of novel proteins. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely utilized PPI datasets demonstrate that JmcPPI surpasses existing optimal baseline models across various data partition schemes. The associated code can be accessed via https://github.com/lijfrank-open/JmcPPI.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Prior Discourse on Conversational Agent-Driven Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persuasion through conversation has been the focus of much research. Nudging is a popular strategy to influence decision-making in physical and digital settings. However, conversational agents employing "nudging" have not received significant attention. We explore the manifestation of cognitive biases-the underlying psychological mechanisms of nudging-and investigate how the complexity of prior dialogue tasks impacts decision-making facilitated by conversational agents. Our research used a between-group experimental design, involving 756 participants randomly assigned to either a simple or complex task before encountering a decision-making scenario. Three scenarios were adapted from Samuelson's classic experiments on status-quo bias, the underlying mechanism of default nudges. Our results aligned with previous studies in two out of three simple-task scenarios. Increasing task complexity consistently shifted effect-sizes toward our hypothesis, though bias was significant in only one case. These findings inform conversational nudging strategies and highlight inherent biases relevant to behavioural economics.</description>

      <title>Learning finitely correlated states: stability of the spectral reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix product operators allow efficient descriptions (or realizations) of states on a 1D lattice. We consider the task of learning a realization of minimal dimension from copies of an unknown state, such that the resulting operator is close to the density matrix in trace norm. For finitely correlated translation-invariant states on an infinite chain, a realization of minimal dimension can be exactly reconstructed via linear algebra operations from the marginals of a size depending on the representation dimension. We establish a bound on the trace norm error for an algorithm that estimates a candidate realization from estimates of these marginals and outputs a matrix product operator, estimating the state of a chain of arbitrary length $t$. This bound allows us to establish an $O(t^2)$ upper bound on the sample complexity of the learning task, with an explicit dependence on the site dimension, realization dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state. A refined error bound can be proven for $C^*$-finitely correlated states, which have an operational interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix product density operators on a finite chain reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(t^3)$. The learning algorithm also works for states that are sufficiently close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.</description>
