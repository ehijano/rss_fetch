      <title>Growth and nodal current of complexified horocycle eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study horocycle eigenfunctions at Lobachevsky plane. They are functions $u\colon \mathbb H=\mathbb C^+=\{z\in\mathbb C\colon \Im z&gt;0\}\to\mathbb C$ such that $\left(-y^2\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)+ 2i\tau y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)u(x+iy)=s^2 u(x+iy)$, $x+iy\in\mathbb C^+$, with $\tau,s\in\mathbb R$, $\tau$ large and $s/\tau$ small. In other words, we study eigenfunctions of magnetic quantum Hamiltonian on hyperbolic plane. By Bohr semiclassical correspondence principle, the asymptotic behavior of such functions is related to horocycle flow on $T\mathbb H$. Let $u^{\mathbb C}$ be analytic continuation of function $u$ to Grauert tube; the latter is an open neighbourhood of $\mathbb H$ in the complexified Lobachevsky plane $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. If a sequence of horocycle functions possesses microlocal quantum ergodicity at the admissible energy level (with $\hbar=1/\tau$) then we may find asymptotic distribution of divisor of $u^{\mathbb C}$. This is done by establishing the asymptotic estimates on $|u^{\mathbb C}|$ in $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. Under imaginary-time horocycle flow, microlocalization of $u$ in $T^*\mathbb H$ is taken to localization of $u^{\mathbb C}$ on $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. The growth of functions $u^{\mathbb C}$ as $\tau\to\infty$ turns to be governed by the growth of complexified gauge factor occurring in $\tau$-automorphic kernels for functions on $\mathbb H$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Instability of Random Fredholm Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $A \colon D(A) \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ is an unbounded Fredholm operator of index $0$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a dense domain $D(A)$, then its spectrum is either discrete or the entire complex plane. This spectral dichotomy plays a central role in the study of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene. This paper proves that if such operators (with certain additional assumptions) are perturbed by certain random trace-class operators, their spectrum is discrete with high probability.</description>

      <title>Stable factorization of the Calder\'on problem via the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove the existence of the Born approximation in the context of the radial Calder\'on problem for Schr\"odinger operators. The Born approximation naturally appears as the linear component of a factorization of the Calder\'on problem; we show that the non-linear part, obtaining the potential from the Born approximation, enjoys several interesting properties. First, this map is local, in the sense that knowledge of the Born approximation in a neighborhood of the boundary is equivalent to knowledge of the potential in the same neighborhood, and, second, it is H\"older stable. This proves that the ill-posedness of the Calder\'on problem arises from the linear step, which consists in computing the Born approximation from the DtN map by solving a Hausdorff moment problem. Moreover, we present an effective algorithm to compute the potential from the Born approximation. Finally, we use the Born approximation to obtain a partial characterization of the set of DtN maps for radial potentials. The proofs of these results do not make use of Complex Geometric Optics solutions or its analogues; they are based on results on inverse spectral theory for Schr\"odinger operators on the half-line, in particular on the concept of $A$-amplitude introduced by Barry Simon.</description>
