      <title>Gentrification, displacement, and income trajectory of incumbents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gentrification is associated with rapid demographic changes within inner-city neighborhoods. While many fear that gentrification drives low-income people from their homes and communities, there is limited evidence of the consequences of these changes. I use Canadian administrative tax files to track the movements of incumbent workers and their income trajectory as their neighborhood gentrifies. I exploit the timing at which neighborhoods gentrify in a matched staggered event-study framework. I find no evidence of displacement effects, even for low socioeconomic status households. In fact, families living in gentrifying neighborhoods are more likely to stay longer. I suggest that this might be related to tenant rights protection laws. When they endogenously decide to leave, low-income families do not relocate to worse neighborhoods. Finally, I find no adverse effects on their income trajectory, suggesting no repercussions on their labor market outcomes.</description>

      <title>Financial Performance and Innovation: Evidence From USA, 1998 - 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between R&amp;D intensity, as a measure of innovation, and financial performance among S&amp;P 500 companies over 100 quarters from 1998 to 2023, including multiple crisis periods. It challenges the conventional wisdom that larger companies are more prone to innovate, using a comprehensive dataset across various industries. The analysis reveals diverse associations between innovation and key financial indicators such as firm size, assets, EBITDA, and tangibility. Our findings underscore the importance of innovation in enhancing firm competitiveness and market positioning, highlighting the effectiveness of countercyclical innovation policies. This research contributes to the debate on the role of R&amp;D investments in driving firm value, offering new insights for both academic and policy discussions.</description>

      <title>How Periodic Forecast Updates Influence MRP Planning Parameters: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many supply chains, the current efforts at digitalization have led to improved information exchanges between manufacturers and their customers. Specifically, demand forecasts are often provided by the customers and regularly updated as the related customer information improves. In this paper, we investigate the influence of forecast updates on the production planning method of Material Requirements Planning (MRP). A simulation study was carried out to assess how updates in information affect the setting of planning parameters in a rolling horizon MRP planned production system. An intuitive result is that information updates lead to disturbances in the production orders for the MRP standard, and, therefore, an extension for MRP to mitigate these effects is developed. A large numerical simulation experiment shows that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic, that has been developed, leads to significantly improved results as far as inventory and backorder costs are concerned. An interesting result is that the fixed-order-quantity lotsizing policy performs - in most instances - better than the fixed-order-period lotsizing policy, when periodic forecast updates occur. In addition, the simulation study shows that underestimating demand is marginally more costly than overestimating it, based on the comparative analysis of all instances. Furthermore, the results indicate that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic can mitigate the negative effects of biased forecasts.</description>

      <title>What Makes Systemic Discrimination, "Systemic?" Exposing the Amplifiers of Inequity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on work spanning economics, public health, education, sociology, and law, I formalize theoretically what makes systemic discrimination "systemic." Injustices do not occur in isolation, but within a complex system of interdependent factors; and their effects may amplify as a consequence. I develop a taxonomy of these amplification mechanisms, connecting them to well-understood concepts in economics that are precise, testable and policy-oriented. This framework reveals that these amplification mechanisms can either be directly disrupted, or exploited to amplify the effects of equity-focused interventions instead. In other words, it shows how to use the machinery of systemic discrimination against itself. Real-world examples discussed include but are not limited to reparations for slavery and Jim Crow, vouchers or place-based neighborhood interventions, police shootings, affirmative action, and Covid-19.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Orientation Values for Biodiversity, Climate and Water: A Scientific Input for Science- Based Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a range of options and outcomes associated with using different allocation approaches to operationalise the Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework at the country, sector, and city scales. We demonstrate: (i) how to translate the PB framework into various sub-global scales (countries, cities, industries); and (ii) how to take global/local aspects (e.g., water use at the watershed level) into account. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to derive country, city, and sector-specific budgets consistent with the PB concept for Switzerland. We then benchmark the translated PBs for climate, biodiversity, and freshwater use against actual environmental pressures in Switzerland from both production- and consumption-based perspectives. This effectively enables us to provide a comprehensive assessment of whether Switzerland is living within its safe operating space.</description>

      <title>Resilient by Design: Simulating Street Network Disruptions across Every Urban Area in the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street networks allow people and goods to move through cities, but they are vulnerable to disasters like floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks. Well-planned network design can make a city more resilient and robust to such disruptions, but we still know little about worldwide patterns of vulnerability, or worldwide empirical relationships between specific design characteristics and resilience. This study quantifies and measures the vulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then models the relationships between vulnerability and street network design characteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than 8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption events representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that disrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else equal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chokepoints, or less circuity are less vulnerable to disruption's impacts. This study thus contributes a new global understanding of network design and vulnerability to the literature. We argue that these design characteristics offer high leverage points for street network resilience and robustness that planners should emphasize when designing or retrofitting urban networks.</description>

      <title>FishNet: Deep Neural Networks for Low-Cost Fish Stock Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fish stock assessment often involves manual fish counting by taxonomy specialists, which is both time-consuming and costly. We propose an automated computer vision system that performs both taxonomic classification and fish size estimation from images taken with a low-cost digital camera. The system first performs object detection and segmentation using a Mask R-CNN to identify individual fish from images containing multiple fish, possibly consisting of different species. Then each fish species is classified and the predicted length using separate machine learning models. These models are trained on a dataset of 50,000 hand-annotated images containing 163 different fish species, ranging in length from 10cm to 250cm. Evaluated on held-out test data, our system achieves a $92\%$ intersection over union on the fish segmentation task, a $89\%$ top-1 classification accuracy on single fish species classification, and a $2.3$~cm mean error on the fish length estimation task.</description>

      <title>Toward environmental sustainability: an empirical study on airports efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to more environmentally sustainable production processes and managerial practices is an increasingly important topic. Many industries need to undergo radical change to meet environmental sustainability requirements; the tourism industry is no exception. In this respect, a particular aspect that needs further attention is the relationship between airport performances and investments in environmental sustainability policies. This work represents a first attempt to provide empirical evidences about this relationship. Through the application of a non-parametrical method, we first assess the efficiency of the Italian airports industry. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between airports performance and management commitment toward the ecological transition using a Tobit regression model. The results show that airports adherence to formal multi-year ecological transition programs has a positive and consistent impact on their performance.</description>
