      <title>Fast decisions with biophysically constrained gene promoter architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells integrate signals and make decisions about their future state in short amounts of time. A lot of theoretical effort has gone into asking how to best design gene regulatory circuits that fulfill a given function, yet little is known about the constraints that performing that function in a small amount of time imposes on circuit architectures. Using an optimization framework, we explore the properties of a class of promoter architectures that distinguish small differences in transcription factor concentrations under time constraints. We show that the full temporal trajectory of gene activity allows for faster decisions than its integrated activity represented by the total number of transcribed mRNA. The topology of promoter architectures that allow for rapidly distinguishing low transcription factor concentrations result in a low, shallow, and non cooperative response, while at high concentrations, the response is high and cooperative. In the presence of non-cognate ligands, networks with fast and accurate decision times need not be optimally selective, especially if discrimination is difficult. While optimal networks are generically out of equilibrium, the energy associated with that irreversibility is only modest, and negligible at small concentrations. Instead, our results highlight the crucial role of rate-limiting steps imposed by biophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Biological Pathways by Applying Selective Incremental Learning to (Very) Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over 80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty (lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning rate.</description>

      <title>Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.</description>

      <title>Positive effects and mechanisms of simulated lunar low-magnetic environment on earthworm-improved lunar soil simulant as a cultivation substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of crewed deep-space missions, Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for lunar bases face stresses from lunar environmental factors. While microgravity and radiation are well-studied, the low-magnetic field's effects remain unclear. Earthworms ("soil scavengers") improve lunar soil simulant and degrade plant waste, as shown in our prior studies. We tested earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from "Lunar Palace 365" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high. Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding deep-space BLSS research.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: A Machine Learning Framework for Lipid Nanoparticle Transfection Efficiency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints, outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings, such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus, LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems design.</description>

      <title>PRING: Rethinking Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction from Pairs to Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Supervised and Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network for Edge-Centric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-based deep learning model for tasks involving relations between two nodes (edge-centric tasks), where the focus lies on predicting relationships and interactions between pairs of nodes rather than node properties themselves. This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.</description>
