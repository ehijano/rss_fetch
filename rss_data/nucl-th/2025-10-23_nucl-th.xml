      <title>Connecting ground-state properties of ${}^6$Li to each other and to scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relationship between the Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient (ANC) of $^6$Li and other low-energy observables in the $\alpha$-deuteron system. Our analysis uses a set of calculations carried out within the {\it ab initio} No Core Shell Model with Continuum (NCSMC) using a variety of inter-nucleon interactions and basis sizes, and yielding ${}^6$Li deuteron separation energies between 1.3 and 1.8 MeV [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 042503 (2022)]. These NCSMC calculations show that the square of the ANC is strongly correlated with the separation energy over this range. In this work, we investigate the origin of this correlation using the phenomenological $R$-matrix, a single-channel potential and a perturbative approach. We show that this correlation occurs because the depth of the $\alpha$-deuteron central potential changes by only a small relative amount as the separation energy varies. We then investigate if the ANC can be accurately extracted from $\alpha$-deuteron phase shifts in an ideal case in which low-energy data are available and there are no experimental errors. We find that both $R$-matrix and Coulomb-modified effective-range theory (CM-ERE) yield extracted ANCs close to, although not exactly equal to, the true value, provided the extrapolation is constrained by the known position of the bound-state pole and at least three terms are included in the fit function. The $R$-matrix approach converges faster than the CM-ERE as the number of parameters increases and is also more robust against the inclusion of low-energy and high-energy phase shift data. Finally, our study also shows that a naive quantification of uncertainties by comparing different truncations used in both theories is not accurate, and suggests the accuracy of ANCs extracted from phase shift data needs further investigation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the spurious-state problem in Dirac equation by using the staggered-grid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretizing the Dirac equation on a uniform grid with the central difference formula often generates spurious states. We propose a staggered-grid scheme in the framework of the finite-difference method that suppresses these spurious states without introducing Wilson terms or ad-hoc filtering. In this approach, the large and small components of the Dirac equation are placed on interlaced nodes, and the first-order derivatives are evaluated between staggered points, yielding a Hamiltonian that breaks the unitary transformation between $H_\kappa$ and $H_{-\kappa}$. Benchmarks with the nuclear Woods-Saxon potentials demonstrate one-to-one agreement with the eigenvalues obtained from shooting method and asymmetric finite-difference method, rapid convergence for weakly bound states, and reduced box-size sensitivity. The method retains the simplicity of central differences and standard matrix diagonalization, while naturally extending to higher-order and multi-dimension systems. It provides a compact and efficient tool for relativistic bound-state and scattering calculations.</description>

      <title>The universal size compression effect of nucleon pair in finite nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the size evolution of the di-neutron (2n), di-proton (2p), and deuteron (d) in 6He, 14Be, 17B, 6Be, 17Ne, and 6Li using microscopic calculations. Remarkably, all nucleon pairs exhibit a universal size compression at the nuclear surface, regardless of their species and binding energies. These features correspond to the BCS- and BEC-like nucleon pairs, which recent experimental techniques can further investigate.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy of fission fragments within a dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic energy of individual fission fragment for actinide nuclei is, for example, important for evaluating the prompt-neutron spectrum in the laboratory system. It is experimentally known that kinetic energy for each fragment is constant at about 100 MeV for light fragments and that for heavy fragments decreases linearly with mass number. Most of the theoretical studies carried out so far attempted to calculate the total kinetic energy of both fragments, i.e. sum of the energies of two fragments, but the kinetic energy of each fragment was not analyzed in detail as far as we recognize. We have calculated them in thermal-neutron induced fission of $^{239}\mathrm{Pu}$ with a dynamical model using Langevin equations within a three-dimensional two-center parametrization. Also fission of $^{258}\mathrm{Fm}$ was investigated. It is calculated from the Coulomb energy at the scission point and the pre-scission kinetic energy. It is found that the pre-scission kinetic energy has about 2-4% contribution in the kinetic energy. The calculated results reproduce the trend of the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Measuring Global Spin Density Matrix Elements of Vector Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration has reported a significant $\phi$-meson global spin alignment ($\rho_{00}$) signal in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq62$ GeV by measuring the polar angle distribution of $\phi$-meson daughters with respect to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) direction of the collision system. In this paper, a new method is explored for studying vector-meson global spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions by examining the two dimensional polar and azimuthal angle distribution. This method allows simultaneous extraction of $\rho_{00}$ and off-diagonal spin density matrix elements (SDMEs), providing unique access to local quark-antiquark spin correlations and spin hydrodynamics in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The new 2D method also removes potential biases from non-zero off-diagonal SDMEs on $\rho_{00}$ with the 1D method. A detailed procedure to correct for detector acceptance and resolution effects is also presented and validated by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Unified Resummation of Soft Gluon Radiation in Heavy Meson Pair Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for $|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q \ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$ the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$. Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements. Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing the QGP through $p_T$-differential radial flow of heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $p_T$-differential radial flow $v_0(p_T)$ in the heavy-quark sector. Within an event-by-event Langevin framework, we show that this observable exhibits a strong sensitivity to the heavy quark-bulk interaction. It provides a powerful and novel tool to constrain the transport coefficients of heavy quarks in the QGP and, more generally, to assess the strength of the interaction of a Brownian particle in an expanding bulk medium. The results further indicate that heavy quarks exhibit collective behavior driven by the isotropic expansion of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions and, at low $p_T$, it offers a marked signature of the heavy quark hadronization mechanism.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) exper- iments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present co- herent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.</description>

      <title>The Regulated GeAs Cycles with the New $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As Reaction Rates and Their Impact on the GS 1826$-$24 Clocked Bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110, 065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential $^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident. Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Engineering the shapes of quark-gluon plasma droplets by comparing anisotropic flow in small symmetric and asymmetric collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of collective flow phenomena in small collision systems challenges our understanding of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation and evolution. This complexity lies in the initial geometries, which are influenced by both nucleon configuration and subnucleonic fluctuations, introducing uncertainties in interpreting flow patterns. We disentangle these contributions through comparative measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in asymmetric $d$+Au and symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, which produce medium of comparable sizes but with vastly different initial geometries. The larger $v_2$ in $d$+Au reflects its dominant elliptic geometry, while the similar $v_3$ in both systems is better explained by considering subnucleonic fluctuations. These contrasting flow patterns are quantitatively described by a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model tuned to large-system Au+Au data, indicating efficient transformation of initial geometries to final-state anisotropies. These results provide evidence for droplet formation in small systems with transport properties that are similar to those observed in large collision systems, consistent with QGP-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Beta-decay Half Lives beyond $^{54}$Ca: A Systematic Survey of Decay Properties approaching the Neutron Dripline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an experiment performed at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) using the FRIB Decay Station initiator (FDSi), 15 new half lives of isotopes near $^{54}$Ca were measured. A new method of extracting lifetimes from experimental data, taking into account the unknown $\beta$-delayed neutron emission branches of very neutron-rich nuclei, was developed to enable systematic uncertainty analysis. The experiment observed a dramatic change in the half-life systematics for the isotopes with neutron number N =34. Beyond N =34, the decline of nuclear lifetime is much slower, leading to longer than anticipated lifetimes for near-dripline nuclei. State-of-the-art shell-model calculations can explain the experimental results for Z$&gt;$19 nuclei, revealing the imprint of shell effects and the need for modification of single-particle neutron states. The results from a newly developed QRPA model with potential for making global predictions were also tested against the experimental results and good agreement was found.</description>

      <title>Impact of ground-state properties and collective excitations on the Skyrme ansatz: a Bayesian study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory are successful in the description of nuclei throughout the whole nuclear chart. Among them, some differences arise regarding their accuracy. For a given nuclear model, this depends on the procedure adopted to determine the parameters, and, at the same time, new experimental findings constantly challenge theory. In the present work, we present a Bayesian inference study aimed at assessing the performance of the Skyrme Energy Density Functional. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we restrict to spherical, double-magic nuclei, giving equal emphasis to ground-state and dynamical properties. Our basic constraints are: i) masses and charge radii, which are known to be very sensitive to the saturation energy and density; ii) spin-orbit splittings, which are associated with the spin-orbit parameter(s); iii) the electric dipole polarizability and parity-violating asymmetry, which are associated with the density dependence of the symmetry energy; iv) the excitation energy of the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance, to constrain the nuclear matter incompressibility; v) the energy-weighted sum rule of the Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance, to account for the isovector effective mass; and vi) the excitation energy of the Isoscalar Quadrupole Resonance, that is related to the isoscalar effective mass. In this way, we test the Skyrme ansatz in a statistically meaningful way, by determining the posterior distributions of the parameters as well as their correlation, and discussing a possible strategy for future developments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of momentum-dependent relaxation time approximation in the Boltzmann equation within the Bjorken flow framework by analyzing the moments of the single-particle distribution function. The moment equations, which form an infinite hierarchy, provide important insights about the system dynamics and the approach towards equilibrium for systems far from equilibrium. The momentum-dependent collision kernel couples moments through both the energy exponents and the angular dependence via various-order Legendre polynomials, resulting in an intricate system of infinitely coupled equations. A naive truncation of the coupled equations results in diverging moments at late times. We outline strategies for solving the coupled system, including a novel approach for managing the divergences and non-integer moments. We show a significant influence of momentum dependent relaxation time on the time evolution of the moments, particularly for higher-order moments and system with smaller shear viscosity over entropy density, emphasizing the importance of incorporating such dependence for a more accurate description of the system dynamics with low shear viscosity such as the quark-gluon-plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$-deuteron momentum correlation functions incorporating deuteron breakup contributions in Faddeev formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of the deuteron breakup are estimated for the $\Lambda$-deuteron momentum correlation function. Faddeev amplitudes in calculating low-energy $\Lambda$-deuteron scattering can provide not only the elastic scattering part but also breakup wave functions in the incident and the rearrangement channels. Calculations are carried out using nucleon-nucleon (NN) and hyperon-nucleon (YN) interactions parametrized in chiral effective field theory. The effects of the breakup in the incident channel are found to be marginally insignificant. Those of the rearrangement channel are not negligible, but not large when the source radius is larger than 2.5 fm. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to have the information on the magnitude of these effects in analyzing the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Subnucleonic Fluctuations on the Longitudinal Dynamics of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well understood that subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions have an important impact on the creation of long-range correlations in the transverse plane. This is also true for the creation of particle correlations along the beam direction, which can be measured in particle detectors, e.g. through longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity structures in Pb+Pb collisions using a hybrid model connecting the 3D resolved {\Dipper} initial state model to a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the (sub-)nucleon level and present the effects of their inclusion on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, focusing in this proceedings paper on charged hadron multiplicities, baryon stopping, directed flow and flow decorrelation. We find remarkable agreement to the experimental data regarding directed flow and the rapidity resolved charge particle multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Identified Hadron Production at Hadron Colliders in Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized TMDPDFs at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential, which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulation studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using the SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well-designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, monitoring of the tensor polarization of the deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, where the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximately 80\%.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs, within the model framework. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.</description>
