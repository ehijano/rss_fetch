      <title>NeuResonance: Exploring Feedback Experiences for Fostering the Inter-brain Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When several individuals collaborate on a shared task, their brain activities often synchronize. This phenomenon, known as Inter-brain Synchronization (IBS), is notable for inducing prosocial outcomes such as enhanced interpersonal feelings, including closeness, trust, empathy, and more. Further strengthening the IBS with the aid of external feedback would be beneficial for scenarios where those prosocial feelings play a vital role in interpersonal communication, such as rehabilitation between a therapist and a patient, motor skill learning between a teacher and a student, and group performance art. This paper investigates whether visual, auditory, and haptic feedback of the IBS level can further enhance its intensity, offering design recommendations for feedback systems in IBS. We report findings when three different types of feedback were provided: IBS level feedback by means of on-body projection mapping, sonification using chords, and vibration bands attached to the wrist.</description>

      <title>AlloyLens: A Visual Analytics Tool for High-throughput Alloy Screening and Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing multi-functional alloys requires exploring high-dimensional composition-structure-property spaces, yet current tools are limited to low-dimensional projections and offer limited support for sensitivity or multi-objective tradeoff reasoning. We introduce AlloyLens, an interactive visual analytics system combining a coordinated scatterplot matrix (SPLOM), dynamic parameter sliders, gradient-based sensitivity curves, and nearest neighbor recommendations. This integrated approach reveals latent structure in simulation data, exposes the local impact of compositional changes, and highlights tradeoffs when exact matches are absent. We validate the system through case studies co-developed with domain experts spanning structural, thermal, and electrical alloy design.</description>

      <title>Learning Spatial Awareness for Laparoscopic Surgery with AI Assisted Visual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains surgeons spatial awareness because procedures are performed through a monocular, two-dimensional (2D) endoscopic view. Conventional training methods using dry-lab models or recorded videos provide limited depth cues, often leading trainees to misjudge instrument position and perform ineffective or unsafe maneuvers. To address this limitation, we present an AI-assisted training framework developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim that couples the standard 2D laparoscopic feed with synchronized three-dimensional (3D) visual feedback delivered through a mixed-reality (MR) interface. While trainees operate using the clinical 2D view, validated AI modules continuously localize surgical instruments and detect instrument-tissue interactions in the background. When spatial misjudgments are detected, 3D visual feedback are displayed to trainees, while preserving the original operative perspective. Our framework considers various surgical tasks including navigation, manipulation, transfer, cutting, and suturing. Visually similar 2D cases can be disambiguated through the added 3D context, improving depth perception, contact awareness, and tool orientation understanding.</description>

      <title>The Pervasive Blind Spot: Benchmarking VLM Inference Risks on Everyday Personal Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) introduces profound privacy risks from personal videos. This paper addresses the critical yet unexplored inferential privacy threat, the risk of inferring sensitive personal attributes over the data. To address this gap, we crowdsourced a dataset of 508 everyday personal videos from 58 individuals. We then conducted a benchmark study evaluating VLM inference capabilities against human performance. Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1) VLMs possess superhuman inferential capabilities, significantly outperforming human evaluators, leveraging a shift from object recognition to behavioral inference from temporal streams. (2) Inferential risk is strongly correlated with factors such as video characteristics and prompting strategies. (3) VLM-driven explanation towards the inference is unreliable, as we revealed a disconnect between the model-generated explanations and evidential impact, identifying ubiquitous objects as misleading confounders.</description>

      <title>AI Credibility Signals Outrank Institutions and Engagement in Shaping News Perception on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated content is rapidly becoming a salient component of online information ecosystems, yet its influence on public trust and epistemic judgments remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale mixed-design experiment (N = 1,000) investigating how AI-generated credibility scores affect user perception of political news. Our results reveal that AI feedback significantly moderates partisan bias and institutional distrust, surpassing traditional engagement signals such as likes and shares. These findings demonstrate the persuasive power of generative AI and suggest a need for design strategies that balance epistemic influence with user autonomy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting put-that-there, context aware window interactions via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Bolt's classic "Put-That-There" concept for modern head-mounted displays by pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with XR sensor and tech stack. The agent fuses (i) a semantically segmented 3-D environment, (ii) live application metadata, and (iii) users' verbal, pointing, and head-gaze cues to issue JSON window-placement actions. As a result, users can manage a panoramic workspace through: (1) explicit commands ("Place Google Maps on the coffee table"), (2) deictic speech plus gestures ("Put that there"), or (3) high-level goals ("I need to send a message"). Unlike traditional explicit interfaces, our system supports one-to-many action mappings and goal-centric reasoning, allowing the LLM to dynamically infer relevant applications and layout decisions, including interrelationships across tools. This enables seamless, intent-driven interaction without manual window juggling in immersive XR environments.</description>

      <title>Can Conversational AI Counsel for Change? A Theory-Driven Approach to Supporting Dietary Intentions in Ambivalent Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adherence to healthy diets reduces chronic illness risk, yet rates remain low. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for health communication but often struggle to engage individuals with ambivalent intentions at a pivotal stage of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). We developed CounselLLM, an open-source model enhanced through persona design and few-shot, domain-specific prompts grounded in TTM and Motivational Interviewing (MI). In controlled evaluations, CounselLLM showed stronger use of TTM subprocesses and MI affirmations than human counselors, with comparable linguistic robustness but expressed in more concrete terms. A user study then tested CounselLLM in an interactive counseling setting against a baseline system. While knowledge and perceptions did not change, participants' intentions for immediate dietary change increased significantly after interacting with CounselLLM. Participants also rated it as easy to use, understandable, and supportive. These findings suggest theory-driven LLMs can effectively engage ambivalent individuals and provide a scalable approach to digital counseling.</description>

      <title>OpenCourier: an Open Protocol for Building a Decentralized Ecosystem of Community-owned Delivery Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the platform gig economy has reshaped the landscape of work, its centralized operation by select actors has brought about challenges that impedes workers' well-being. We present the architecture and design of OpenCourier, an open protocol that defines communication patterns within a decentralized ecosystem of delivery platforms. Through this protocol, we aim to address three key challenges in the current economy: power imbalances between the platform and workers, information asymmetries caused by black-boxed algorithms and value misalignments in the infrastructure design process. With the OpenCourier protocol, we outline a blueprint for community-owned ecosystem of delivery platforms that centers worker agency, transparency, and bottom-up design.</description>

      <title>HAGI++: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.</description>

      <title>Emotional Contagion in Code: How GitHub Emoji Reactions Shape Developer Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate, but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p&lt;0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping collaborative outcomes in software development.</description>

      <title>SigmaCollab: An Application-Driven Dataset for Physically Situated Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated human-AI collaboration. The dataset consists of a set of 85 sessions in which untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in performing procedural tasks in the physical world. SigmaCollab includes a set of rich, multimodal data streams, such as the participant and system audio, egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand and gaze tracking information, as well as additional annotations performed post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios. SigmaCollab is available at https://github.com/microsoft/SigmaCollab.</description>

      <title>DropleX: Liquid sensing on tablet touchscreens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DropleX, the first system that enables liquid sensing using the capacitive touchscreen of commodity tablets. DropleX detects microliter-scale liquid samples, and performs non-invasive, through-container measurements to detect whether a drink has been spiked or if a sealed liquid has been contaminated. These capabilities are made possible by a physics-informed mechanism that disables the touchscreen's built-in adaptive filters, originally designed to reject the effects of liquid drops such as rain, without any hardware modifications. We model the touchscreen's sensing capabilities, limits, and non-idealities to inform the design of a signal processing and learning-based pipeline for liquid sensing. Our system achieves 96-99% accuracy in detecting microliter-scale adulteration in soda, wine, and milk, 93-96% accuracy in threshold detection of trace chemical concentrations, and 86-96% accuracy in through-container adulterant detection. Given the predominance of touchscreens, these exploratory results can open new opportunities for liquid sensing on everyday devices.</description>

      <title>Audience Amplified: Virtual Audiences in Asynchronously Performed AR Theater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audience reactions can considerably enhance live experiences; conversely, in anytime-anywhere augmented reality (AR) experiences, large crowds of people might not always be available to congregate. To get closer to simulating live events with large audiences, we created a mobile AR experience where users can wander around naturally and engage in AR theater with virtual audiences trained from real audiences using imitation learning. This allows us to carefully capture the essence of human imperfections and behavior in artificial intelligence (AI) audiences. The result is a novel mobile AR experience in which solitary AR users experience an augmented performance in a physical space with a virtual audience. Virtual dancers emerge from the surroundings, accompanied by a digitally simulated audience, to provide a community experience akin to immersive theater. In a pilot study, simulated human avatars were vastly preferred over just audience audio commentary. We subsequently engaged 20 participants as attendees of an AR dance performance, comparing a no-audience condition with a simulated audience of six onlookers. Through questionnaires and experience reports, we investigated user reactions and behavior. Our results demonstrate that the presence of virtual audience members caused attendees to perceive the performance as a social experience with increased interest and involvement in the event. On the other hand, for some attendees, the dance performances without the virtual audience evoked a stronger positive sentiment.</description>

      <title>Between Myths and Metaphors: Rethinking LLMs for SRH in Conservative Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resource countries represent over 90% of maternal deaths, with Pakistan among the top four countries contributing nearly half in 2023. Since these deaths are mostly preventable, large language models (LLMs) can help address this crisis by automating health communication and risk assessment. However, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) communication in conservative contexts often relies on indirect language that obscures meaning, complicating LLM-based interventions. We conduct a two-stage study in Pakistan: (1) analyzing data from clinical observations, interviews, and focus groups with clinicians and patients, and (2) evaluating the interpretive capabilities of five popular LLMs on this data. Our analysis identifies two axes of communication (referential domain and expression approach) and shows LLMs struggle with semantic drift, myths, and polysemy in clinical interactions. We contribute: (1) empirical themes in SRH communication, (2) a categorization framework for indirect communication, (3) evaluation of LLM performance, and (4) design recommendations for culturally-situated SRH communication.</description>

      <title>Text to Robotic Assembly of Multi Component Objects using 3D Generative AI and Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</description>

      <title>Demo: Statistically Significant Results On Biases and Errors of LLMs Do Not Guarantee Generalizable Results</title>

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.</description>

      <title>Human-Machine Ritual: Synergic Performance through Real-Time Motion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (&lt;50 ms latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.</description>

      <title>The Other Side of the Screen: Motivations to Watch and Engage in Software Development Live Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: With the popularity of live streaming platforms at an all-time high, and many people turning to alternative venues for educational needs, this full research paper explores the viewership habits of software and game development live streams through the lens of informal education opportunities. Purpose: We investigate why developers watch software and game development live streams to understand the educational and social benefits they derive from this emerging form of informal learning. Methods: We implement a mixed-methods study combining survey data from 39 viewers and nine semi-structured interviews to analyze motivations, perceptions, and outcomes of watching development live streams. Findings: This research finds that viewers are motivated by both educational and social factors, with community engagement and informal mentorship as key motivations. Additionally, we find that technical learning draws initial interest, but social connections and co-working aspects sustain long-term engagement. Implications: Live streaming serves as a valuable informal learning tool that combines self-directed technical education with community support, which suggests that developers can leverage these platforms for continuous learning and professional growth outside of or in addition to traditional educational structures.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Psychological Simulation System for Human Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice, yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism) and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.</description>

      <title>Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward: teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use KT models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Psychometric Analysis with Interactive SIA Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ShinyItemAnalysis (SIA) is an R package and shiny application for an interactive presentation of psychometric methods and analysis of multi-item measurements in psychology, education, and social sciences in general. In this article, we present a new feature introduced in the recent version of the package, called "SIA modules", which allows researchers and practitioners to offer new analytical methods for broader use via add-on extensions. SIA modules are designed to integrate with and build upon the SIA interactive application, enabling them to leverage the existing infrastructure for tasks such as data uploading and processing. They can access and further use a range of outputs from various analyses, including models and datasets. Because SIA modules come in R packages (or extend the existing ones), they may come bundled with their datasets, use object-oriented systems, or even compiled code. We illustrate the concepts using sample modules from the newly introduced SIAmodules package and other packages. After providing a general overview of building Shiny applications, we describe how to develop the SIA add-on modules with the support of the new SIAtools package. Finally, we discuss possibilities of future development and emphasize the importance of freely available, interactive psychometric software for dissemination of methodological innovations.</description>

      <title>ValueCompass: A Framework for Measuring Contextual Value Alignment Between Human and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, ensuring their alignment with a diverse range of individuals and societal values becomes increasingly critical. But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Context. Chat-based and inline-coding-based GenAI has already had substantial impact on the CS Education community. The recent introduction of ``vibe coding'' may further transform how students program, as it introduces a new way for students to create software projects with minimal oversight.
  Objectives. The purpose of this study is to understand how students in introductory programming and advanced software engineering classes interact with a vibe coding platform (Replit) when creating software and how the interactions differ by programming background.
  Methods. Interview participants were asked to think-aloud while building a web application using Replit. Thematic analysis was then used to analyze the video recordings with an emphasis on the interactions between the student and Replit.
  Findings. For both groups, the majority of student interactions with Replit were to test or debug the prototype and only rarely did students visit code. Prompts by advanced software engineering students were much more likely to include relevant app feature and codebase contexts than those by introductory programming students.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Future Atmospheric Conditions Training System (FACTS), a novel platform that advances climate resilience education through place-based, adaptive learning experiences. FACTS combines real-time atmospheric data collected by IoT sensors with curated resources from a Knowledge Base to dynamically generate localized learning challenges. Learner responses are analyzed by a Generative AI powered server, which delivers personalized feedback and adaptive support. Results from a user evaluation indicate that participants found the system both easy to use and effective for building knowledge related to climate resilience. These findings suggest that integrating IoT and Generative AI into atmospherically adaptive learning technologies holds significant promise for enhancing educational engagement and fostering climate awareness.</description>

      <title>AuthGlass: Enhancing Voice Authentication on Smart Glasses via Air-Bone Acoustic Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of smart glasses, voice interaction has become widely deployed due to its naturalness and convenience. However, its practicality is often undermined by the vulnerability to spoofing attacks and interference from surrounding sounds, making seamless voice authentication crucial for smart glasses usage. To address this challenge, we propose AuthGlass, a voice authentication approach that leverages both air- and bone-conducted speech features to enhance accuracy and liveness detection. Aiming to gain comprehensive knowledge on speech-related acoustic and vibration features, we built a smart glasses prototype with redundant synchronized microphones: 14 air-conductive microphones and 2 bone-conductive units. In a study with 42 participants, we validated that combining sound-field and vibration features significantly improves authentication robustness and attack resistance. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that AuthGlass maintains competitive accuracy even under various practical scenarios, highlighting its applicability and scalability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate optically driven displays with up to 1,511 addressable pixels -- several times more pixels than any prior tactile display attaining comparable performance. Perceptual studies confirm that these displays can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Towards Stable and Personalised Profiles for Lexical Alignment in Spoken Human-Agent Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10 items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles, taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.</description>

      <title>Learning with Category-Equivariant Architectures for Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CatEquiv, a category-equivariant neural network for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors that systematically encodes temporal, amplitude, and structural symmetries. We introduce a symmetry category that jointly represents cyclic time shifts, positive gain scalings, and the sensor-hierarchy poset, capturing the categorical symmetry structure of the data. CatEquiv achieves equivariance with respect to the categorical symmetry product. On UCI-HAR under out-of-distribution perturbations, CatEquiv attains markedly higher robustness compared with circularly padded CNNs and plain CNNs. These results demonstrate that enforcing categorical symmetries yields strong invariance and generalization without additional model capacity.</description>

      <title>AI for Requirements Engineering: Industry adoption and Practitioner perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of AI for Requirements Engineering (RE) presents significant benefits but also poses real challenges. Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</description>
