      <title>Excitation spectrum of vortex-lattice modes in a rotating condensate with a density-dependent gauge potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitation spectrum of a quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a harmonic confinement with nonlinear rotation induced by a density-dependent gauge field. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes(BdG) analysis, we show that the dipole mode frequency depends strongly on the nonlinear interaction strength, violating Kohn's theorem. Further utilizing the variational analysis, we derive analytical expressions for the dipole and breathing modes, which suggests a strong dependence of the condensate's width on the nonlinear rotation resulting from the density-dependent gauge potential. We identify four different vortex displacement modes -- namely Tkachenko, circular, quadratic, and rational-whose frequencies are sensitive to the nonlinear rotation. In addition to the numerical analysis, we also derive an analytical expression for the Tkachenko mode frequency using a Hydrodynamic approach that agrees well with the frequencies obtained by the Fourier analysis of the transverse and longitudinal vortex dynamics induced by a Gaussian perturbation as well as the frequencies from the BdG excitation spectrum. Our findings also reveal that the excitation spectrum remain symmetric around the angular quantum number $l=0$, with modified energy splitting between $l$ and $-l$ as the nonlinear rotation changes from negative to positive values. Finally, we demonstrate that the surface mode excitation frequency increases (decreases) with an increase in the positive (negative) nonlinear rotation strength.</description>

      <title>Interplay of asymmetry and fragmentation in the many-body tunneling dynamics of two-dimensional bosonic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the many-body tunneling of a bosonic condensate leads to (longitudinal) fragmentation along the tunneling direction. In this work, we prepare the initial ground state as a (transversely) fragmented system by introducing a barrier oriented orthogonally to the tunneling direction and allow it to tunnel through a two-dimensional longitudinally and transversely-asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions. For a fixed barrier height, we find that the initial transversal fragmentation is essentially independent of the asymmetry along the tunneling direction but reduces when the asymmetry is oriented orthogonally to the junction. We investigate the interplay between the interference of fragmentations and asymmetry in the junction by analyzing the rate of density collapse in the survival probability, the uncertainty product, and the nontrivial dynamics of the occupation of the first excited orbital. The interference of fragmentations is quantified by the ratio between the reduction of transverse fragmentation and the development of longitudinal fragmentation. We show that asymmetry along the junction (orthogonal to the junction) delays (accelerates), compared to the symmetric potential, in obtaining the maximal interference of fragmentations. Notably, self-trapping opposes the interference, whereas a resonant tunneling condition enhances it. Overall, we demonstrate that the influence of asymmetry on the competition between longitudinal and transversal fragmentations, which together govern the macroscopic tunneling dynamics of interacting bosons, arises purely from the many-body effects and has no counterpart in the mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to non-linearly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.</description>

      <title>Transport of magnetically sensitive atoms in a magnetic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable two- and four-droplet solitons in a very strongly dipolar NaCs condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strongly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Dy atoms could sustain different types of states not possible in a non-dipolar BEC. Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [N. Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)], with dipolar interaction stronger by more than an order of magnitude compared to that of Dy atoms, we demonstrate that in a very strongly dipolar NaCs BEC, it is possible to have a two- and a four-droplet metastable soliton, axially free along the polarization $z$ direction. In this study we employ imaginary-time propagation of an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction. The dipolar solitons are subject to an expulsive Gaussian potential at the center and a harmonic potential $-$ both acting in the $x$-$y$ plane. The phase-coherent solitons, possessing the isolated droplets, are free to move along the $z$ axis without any relative motion between the droplets. The dynamical stability and mobility of these solitons are demonstrated by real-time propagation employing the converged imaginary-time wave function as the initial state.</description>
