      <title>Foundations of logic programming in hybrid-dynamic quantum logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of the present paper is the introduction of a simple yet expressive hybrid-dynamic logic for describing quantum programs. This version of quantum logic can express quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of states in a natural way based on concepts advanced in (hybrid and dynamic) modal logics. We then study Horn clauses in the hybrid-dynamic quantum logic proposed, and develop a series of results that lead to an initial semantics theorem for sets of clauses that are satisfiable. This shows that a significant fragment of hybrid-dynamic quantum logic has good computational properties, and can serve as a basis for defining executable languages for specifying quantum programs. We set the foundations of logic programming in this fragment by proving a variant of Herbrand's theorem, which reduces the semantic entailment of a logic-programming query by a program to the search of a suitable substitution.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Dynamic Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games provide means to characterize elementary equivalence for first-order logic, and by standard translation also for modal logics. We propose a novel generalization of Ehrenfeucht- Fra\"iss\'e games to hybrid-dynamic logics which is direct and fully modular: parameterized by the features of the hybrid language we wish to include, for instance, the modal and hybrid language operators as well as first-order existential quantification. We use these games to establish a new modular Fra\"iss\'e-Hintikka Theorem for hybrid-dynamic propositional logic and its various fragments. We study the relationship between countable game equivalence (determined by countable Ehrenfeucht- Fra\"iss\'e games) and bisimulation (determined by countable back-and-forth systems). In general, the former turns out to be weaker than the latter, but under certain conditions on the language, the two coincide. We also use games to prove that for reachable image-finite Kripke structures elementary equivalence implies isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Categories of quantum cpos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper unites two research lines. The first involves finding categorical models of quantum programming languages and their type systems. The second line concerns the program of quantization of mathematical structures, which amounts to finding noncommutative generalizations (also called quantum generalizations) of these structures. Using a quantization method called discrete quantization, which essentially amounts to the internalization of structures in a category of von Neumann algebras and quantum relations, we find a noncommutative generalization of $\omega$-complete partial orders (cpos), called quantum cpos. Cpos are central in domain theory, and are widely used to construct categorical models of programming languages. We show that quantum cpos have similar categorical properties to cpos and are therefore suitable for the construction of categorical models for quantum programming languages, which is illustrated with some examples. For this reason, quantum cpos may form the backbone of a future quantum domain theory.</description>

      <title>Process-Driven Autoformalization in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoformalization, the conversion of natural language mathematics into formal languages, offers significant potential for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are limited to formal languages with substantial online corpora and struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving languages like Lean 4. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark \textbf{Form}alization for \textbf{L}ean~\textbf{4} (\textbf{\name}) designed to evaluate the autoformalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This benchmark encompasses a comprehensive assessment of questions, answers, formal statements, and proofs. Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rocess-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{V}erifier (\textbf{PSV}) model that leverages the precise feedback from Lean 4 compilers to enhance autoformalization. Our experiments demonstrate that the PSV method improves autoformalization, enabling higher accuracy using less filtered training data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with data containing detailed process information, PSV can leverage the data more effectively, leading to more significant improvements in autoformalization for Lean 4. Our dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/rookie-joe/PDA}.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Generalization of Deep Learning to Out-of-Distribution Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of machine learning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various application domains. However, despite their success, DNN-based models may occasionally exhibit challenges with generalization, i.e., may fail to handle inputs that were not encountered during training. This limitation is a significant challenge when it comes to deploying deep learning for safety-critical tasks, as well as in real-world settings characterized by substantial variability. We introduce a novel approach for harnessing DNN verification technology to identify DNN-driven decision rules that exhibit robust generalization to previously unencountered input domains. Our method assesses generalization within an input domain by measuring the level of agreement between independently trained deep neural networks for inputs in this domain. We also efficiently realize our approach by using off-the-shelf DNN verification engines, and extensively evaluate it on both supervised and unsupervised DNN benchmarks, including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) system for Internet congestion control -- demonstrating the applicability of our approach for real-world settings. Moreover, our research introduces a fresh objective for formal verification, offering the prospect of mitigating the challenges linked to deploying DNN-driven systems in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Description Complexity of Unary Structures in First-Order Logic with Links to Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description complexity of a model is the length of the shortest formula that defines the model. We study the description complexity of unary structures in first-order logic FO, also drawing links to semantic complexity in the form of entropy. The class of unary structures provides a simple way to represent tabular Boolean data sets as relational structures. We define structures with FO-formulas that are strictly linear in the size of the model as opposed to using the naive quadratic ones, and we use arguments based on formula size games to obtain related lower bounds for description complexity. We also obtain a precise asymptotic result on the expected description complexity of a randomly selected structure. We then give bounds on the relationship between Shannon entropy and description complexity. We extend this relationship also to Boltzmann entropy by establishing an asymptotic match between the two entropies. Despite the simplicity of unary structures, our arguments require the use of formula size games, Stirling's approximation and Chernoff bounds.</description>

      <title>clauseSMT: A NLSAT-Based Clause-Level Framework for Satisfiability Modulo Nonlinear Real Arithmetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework has been applied to SMT problems on different arithmetic theories. NLSAT, an implementation using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for explanation, is especially competitive among nonlinear real arithmetic constraints. However, current Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style algorithms only consider literal information for decision, and thus ignore clause-level influence on arithmetic variables. As a consequence, NLSAT encounters unnecessary conflicts caused by improper literal decisions.
  In this work, we analyze the literal decision caused conflicts, and introduce clause-level information with a direct effect on arithmetic variables. Two main algorithm improvements are presented: clause-level feasible-set based look-ahead mechanism and arithmetic propagation based branching heuristic. We implement our solver named clauseSMT on our dynamic variable ordering framework. Experiments show that clauseSMT is competitive on nonlinear real arithmetic theory against existing SMT solvers (cvc5, Z3, Yices2), and outperforms all these solvers on satisfiable instances of SMT(QF_NRA) in SMT-LIB. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are also studied.</description>

      <title>Fast and Secure Decentralized Optimistic Rollups Using Setchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern blockchains face a scalability challenge due to the intrinsic throughput limitations of consensus protocols. Layer 2 optimistic rollups (L2) are a faster alternative that offer the same interface in terms of smart contract development and user interaction. Optimistic rollups perform most computations offchain and make light use of an underlying blockchain (L1) to guarantee correct behavior, implementing a cheaper blockchain on a blockchain solution. With optimistic rollups, a sequencer calculates offchain batches of L2 transactions and commits batches (compressed or hashed) to the L1 blockchain. The use of hashes requires a data service to translate hashes into their corresponding batches. Current L2 implementations consist of a centralized sequencer (central authority) and an optional data availability committee (DAC).
  In this paper, we propose a decentralized L2 optimistic rollup based on Setchain, a decentralized Byzantine-tolerant implementation of sets. The main contribution is a fully decentralized "arranger" where arrangers are a formal definition combining sequencers and DACs. We prove our implementation correct and show empirical evidence that our solution scales. A final contribution is a system of incentives (payments) for servers that implement the sequencer and data availability committee protocols correctly, and a fraud-proof mechanism to detect violations of the protocol.</description>

      <title>Chronosymbolic Learning: Efficient CHC Solving with Symbolic Reasoning and Inductive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) is a fundamental challenge behind a wide range of verification and analysis tasks. Data-driven approaches show great promise in improving CHC solving without the painstaking manual effort of creating and tuning various heuristics. However, a large performance gap exists between data-driven CHC solvers and symbolic reasoning-based solvers. In this work, we develop a simple but effective framework, "Chronosymbolic Learning", which unifies symbolic information and numerical data points to solve a CHC system efficiently. We also present a simple instance of Chronosymbolic Learning with a data-driven learner and a BMC-styled reasoner. Despite its relative simplicity, experimental results show the efficacy and robustness of our tool. It outperforms state-of-the-art CHC solvers on a dataset consisting of 288 benchmarks, including many instances with non-linear integer arithmetics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of an Abstract Domain of Quantified First-Order Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper lays a practical foundation for using abstract interpretation with an abstract domain that consists of sets of quantified first-order logic formulas. This abstract domain seems infeasible at first sight due to the complexity of the formulas involved and the enormous size of sets of formulas (abstract elements). We introduce an efficient representation of abstract elements, which eliminates redundancies based on a novel syntactic subsumption relation that under-approximates semantic entailment. We develop algorithms and data structures to efficiently compute the join of an abstract element with the abstraction of a concrete state, operating on the representation of abstract elements. To demonstrate feasibility of the domain, we use our data structures and algorithms to implement a symbolic abstraction algorithm that computes the least fixpoint of the best abstract transformer of a transition system, which corresponds to the strongest inductive invariant. We succeed at finding, for example, the least fixpoint for Paxos (which in our representation has 1,438 formulas with $\forall^*\exists^*\forall^*$ quantification) in time comparable to state-of-the-art property-directed approaches.</description>

      <title>Transductive Sample Complexities Are Compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $H$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to any proper metric loss function (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</description>

      <title>Reachability and Safety Games under TSO Semantics (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider games played on the transtion graph of concurrent programs running under the Total Store Order (TSO) weak memory model. Games are frequently used to model the interaction between a system and its environment, in this case between the concurrent processes and the nondeterminisitic TSO buffer updates. The game is played by two players, who alternatingly make a move: The process player can execute any enabled instruction of the processes, while the update player takes care of updating the messages in the buffers that are between each process andthe shared memory. We show that the reachability and safety problem of this game reduce to the analysis of single-process (non-concurrent) programs. In particular, they exhibit only finite-state behaviour. Because of this, we introduce different notions of fairness, which force the two players to behave in a more realistic way. Both the reachability and safety problem then become undecidable.</description>
