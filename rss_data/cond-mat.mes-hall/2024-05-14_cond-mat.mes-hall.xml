      <title>Optical Imaging of Flavor Order in Flat Band Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin and valley flavor polarization plays a central role in the many-body physics of flat band graphene, with fermi surface reconstructions often accompanied by quantized anomalous Hall and superconducting state observed in a variety of experimental systems. Here we describe an optical technique that sensitively and selectively detects flavor textures via the exciton response of a proximal transition metal dichalcogenide layer. Through a systematic study of rhombohedral and rotationally faulted graphene bilayers and trilayers, we show that when the semiconducting dichalcogenide is in direct contact with the graphene, the exciton response is most sensitive to the large momentum rearrangement of the Fermi surface, providing information that is distinct from and complementary to electrical compressibility measurements. The wide-field imaging capability of optical probes allows us to obtain spatial maps of flavor orders with high throughput, and with broad temperature and device compatibility. Our work paves the way for optical probing and imaging of flavor orders in flat band graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced photon indistinguishability at room temperature and telecom wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indistinguishable single photons in the telecom-bandwidth of optical fibers are indispensable for long-distance quantum communication. Solid-state single photon emitters have achieved excellent performance in key benchmarks, however, the demonstration of indistinguishability at room-temperature remains a major challenge. Here, we report room-temperature photon indistinguishability at telecom wavelengths from individual nanotube defects in a fiber-based microcavity operated in the regime of incoherent good cavity-coupling. The efficiency of the coupled system outperforms spectral or temporal filtering, and the photon indistinguishability is increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the free-space limit. Our results highlight a promising strategy to attain optimized non-classical light sources.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum phase transitions driven by displacement fields in the twisted MoTe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under applied out-of-plane displacement fields. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and dynamics of magnetic antivortices in a nanodisk with anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the antivortex stabilized by anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in nanodisks. It is remarkably found that the antivortex remains stable even when the nanodisk radius is reduced to 15 nm, owing to the short-range nature of the DMI. We also investigate the antivortex dynamics under a static in-plane magnetic field, which shows that the displacement of the antivortex core depends on its vorticity and helicity, providing a fundamental basic for distinguishing different vortex types. Additionally, spin-polarized currents can trigger a self-sustained gyration of the antivortex at low current densities, while inducing polarity switching at high current densities. Our findings offer valuable insights into the DMI role in stabilizing topological solitons and their potential applications in spin-torque nano-oscillators and magnetic memories.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall magnetoresistance in Pt/(Ga,Mn)N devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) have attracted significant attention for their potential in spintronic applications. Particularly, magnetically-doped GaN is highly attractive due to its high relevance for the CMOS industry and the possibility of developing advanced spintronic devices which are fully compatible with the current industrial procedures. Despite this interest, there remains a need to investigate the spintronic parameters that characterize interfaces within these systems. Here, we perform spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements to evaluate the spin transfer at a Pt/(Ga,Mn)N interface. We determine the transparency of the interface through the estimation of the real part of the spin mixing conductance finding $G_r = 2.6\times 10^{14} \, \Omega^{-1} m^{-2}$, comparable to state-of-the-art yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt interfaces. Moreover, the magnetic ordering probed by SMR above the (Ga,Mn)N Curie temperature TC provides a broader temperature range for the efficient generation and detection of spin currents, relaxing the conditions for this material to be applied in new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin interaction mediated by chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction between two magnetic impurities on top of a two dimensional insulator in the presence of chiral phonons by second-order perturbation theory. We show that this exchange interaction arises from angular momentum of phonons through spin-chiral phonon interaction of the form of spin-orbit coupling. Analytical expressions of the interaction for acoustic and optical phonons are obtained. The exchange interactions are always positive due to the bosonic nature of phonons. We find that the exchange interactions for acoustic and optical phonons show power-law decay with respect to the distance between the two magnetic impurities and are proportional to the temperature of the system at high temperature.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced superconductivity via band engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moir\'e system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable generation of spatial entanglement in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surface Adsorbates and Dimensionality on Templating of Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites (HPs) are promising materials for various optoelectronic applications, yet a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics is still elusive. Here, we offer insight into the dynamics of prototypical 2D HPs based on MAPbI$_3$ as a function of linker molecule and the number of perovskite layers using atomic scale simulations. We show that the layers closest to the linker undergo transitions that are distinct from those of the interior layers. These transitions can take place anywhere between a few tens of Kelvin below to more than 100 K above the cubic-tetragonal transition of bulk MAPbI$_3$. In combination with the thickness of the perovskite layer this enables one to template phase transitions and tune the dynamics over a wide temperature range. Our results thereby reveal the details of an important and generalizable design mechanism for tuning the properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>Application of Probabilistic-bit in Precision Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for precision measurement utilizing an ensemble of probabilistic bits (p-bits). This method leverages the inherent fluctuations of p-bits to achieve high sensitivity in various applications, including magnetic field sensing, temperature monitoring and timekeeping. The sensitivity scales proportionally to the square root of the total number of p-bits, enabling unprecedented accuracy with large ensembles. Furthermore, the robustness of this method against device imperfections and non-uniformity enhances its practicality and scalability. This work paves the way for a new paradigm in precision measurement, offering a cost-effective and versatile alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a spinning microwave magnonic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a spinning microwave magnonic system composed of a spinning microwave resonator coupled with an yttrium iron garnet sphere with magnon Kerr effect. Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and one-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the system is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Towards the Quantized Anomalous Hall effect in AlO$_x$-capped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ harbors a rich interplay between magnetism and topology, holding a significant promise for low-power electronic devices and topological antiferromagnetic spintronics. In recent years, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has garnered considerable attention as the only known material to exhibit the antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, this field faces significant challenges as realizing quantized transport at zero magnetic fields depends critically on fabricating high-quality device. In this article, we address the detrimental influences of fabrication on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ by simply depositing an AlO$_x$ thin layer on the surface prior to fabrications. Optical contrast and magnetotransport measurements on over 50 samples demonstrate that AlO$_x$ can effectively preserve the pristine state of the samples and significantly enhance the anomalous Hall effect towards quantization. Scaling analysis reveals the Berry curvature dominated mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect at various magnetic configurations. By adjusting the gate voltage, we uncover a gate independent antiferromagnetism in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our experiment not only pave the way for fabricating high-quality transport devices but also advance the exploration of exotic quantum physics in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect Modulated by Spin Flips and Flops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between nontrivial band topology and layered antiferromagnetism in MnBi2Te4 has opened up a new avenue for exploring topological phases of matter. Representative examples include the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state observed in odd and even number layers of MnBi2Te4, when the top and bottom surfaces have parallel and antiparallel spin alignments respectively. The rich and complex spin dynamics associated with the van der Waals antiferromagnetic order is expected to generate novel topological phases and phase transitions that are unique to MnBi2Te4. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of spin configurations on charge transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and exchange gap of the surface state, in sharp contrast to that in ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. We propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions inherent to van der Waals antiferromagnet. The versatile tunability of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in MnBi2Te4 paves the way for potential applications in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Generalized energy gap law: An open system dynamics approach to non-adiabatic phenomena in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic molecular phenomena, arising from the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, govern the fate of virtually all photo-physical and photochemical processes and limit the quantum efficiency of molecules and other solid-state embedded quantum emitters. A simple and elegant description, the energy gap law, was derived five decades ago, predicting that the non-adiabatic coupling between the excited and ground potential landscapes lead to non-radiative decay with a quasi-exponential dependence on the energy gap. We revisit and extend this theory to account for crucial aspects such as vibrational relaxation, dephasing, and radiative loss. We find a closed analytical solution with general validity which indicates a direct proportionality of the non-radiative rate with the vibrational relaxation rate at low temperatures, and with the dephasing rate of the electronic transition at high temperatures. Our work establishes a connection between nanoscale quantum optics, open quantum system dynamics and non-adiabatic molecular physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We here introduce the concept of fragile topological dislocation modes, which are localized only in a fraction of a topological phase, while otherwise leak into the bulk continuum. We show that such dislocation modes are hosted in an obstructed atomic topological phase in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, but only in a finite region with an indirect gap at high energy. These dislocation modes are realized as chiral pairs at finite energies with protection stemming from a combination of the chiral (unitary particle-hole) and the point group (C$_{4v}$) symmetries, but only when the indirect gap is open. In this regime, we corroborate the stability of the defect modes by following their localization and also by explicitly adding a weak chemical potential disorder. Our findings, therefore, should be consequential for the experimental observation of such modes in designer topological crystals and classical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Entropic signature of resonant thermal transport: Ordered form of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by the existence of boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Charge-4e and charge-6e flux quantization and higher charge superconductivity in kagome superconductor ring devices</title>

Abstract: The flux quantization is a key indication of electron pairing in superconductors. For example, the well-known h/2e flux quantization is considered strong evidence for the existence of the charge-2e, two-electron Cooper pairs. Here we report evidence for multi-charge flux quantization in mesoscopic ring devices fabricated using the transition-metal kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We perform systematic magneto-transport measurements and observe unprecedented quantization of magnetic flux in units of h/4e and h/6e in magnetoresistance oscillations. Specifically, at low temperatures, magnetoresistance oscillations with period h/2e are detected, as expected from the flux quantization for charge-2e superconductivity. We find that the h/2e oscillations are suppressed and replaced by resistance oscillations with h/4e periodicity when temperature is increased. Increasing the temperature further suppresses the h/4e oscillations and robust resistance oscillations with h/6e periodicity emerge as evidence for charge-6e flux quantization. Our observations provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of multi-charge flux quanta and emergent quantum matter exhibiting higher-charge superconductivity in the strongly fluctuating region above the charge-2e Cooper pair condensate, revealing new insights into the intertwined and vestigial electronic order in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical mechanical states in cavity optomechanics in the single-photon strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating nonclassical states of mechanical systems is a challenge relevant for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics and developing quantum technologies. Significant effort has been made to search for such states in the stationary behaviour of cavity optomechanical systems. We focus instead on the transient dynamics. We find that in the strong coupling regime the presence of an optical drive causes an initial mechanical coherent state to evolve to a nonclassical state, with strongly negative Wigner function. An analytical treatment for weak drive reveals that these states are quantum superpositions of coherent states. Numerical simulation shows that the presence of Wigner negativity is robust against weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>
