      <title>The isotropy of cosmic expansion in the early and late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the isotropy of cosmic expansion by combining several probes for the first time, constructing full-sky maps of expansion rate variation using Type Ia supernovae, fundamental plane galaxies, and CMB temperature fluctuations. We find no hint of anisotropy or correlation between early- and late-Universe expansion across all systematic models. The 99% confidence upper limits on expansion rate anisotropy are 0.39% for low-redshift supernovae, 0.95% for high-redshift CMB, and 0.37% when combined at a 60-degree smoothing scale. A significant anomaly in the fundamental plane residual map may reflect systematics in the current DESI dataset, as evidenced by the absence of cross-correlation with other tracers and its correlation with spatial density variations.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent population synthesis of AGN from observational constraints in the X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration. Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of 21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-component SIDM models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution without requiring large cross sections. We propose a model with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, that connects observations across several halo mass scales while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables modest mass segregation in low-mass and typical-concentration halos, consistent with recent dwarf galaxy clustering measurements. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations and controlled isolated halo studies, we show that this model produces dwarf galaxy cores that grow over time, explains the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the number and efficiency of small-scale lenses, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Our results establish mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</description>

      <title>Detection of pure warm-hot intergalactic medium emission from a $7.2$ Mpc long filament in the Shapley supercluster using X-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of the local Universe's baryonic content remains undetected. Cosmological simulations indicate that most of the missing baryons reside in cosmic filaments in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The latter shows low surface brightness and soft X-ray emission, making it challenging to detect. Until now, X-ray WHIM emission has been detected only in very few individual filaments, whereas in even fewer filaments, WHIM has been spectroscopically analyzed. In this work, we used four Suzaku pointings to study the WHIM emission of a filament in the Shapley supercluster, connecting the galaxy cluster pairs A3530/32 and A3528-N/S. We additionally employ XMM-Newton observations to robustly account for point sources in the filament and to fully characterize the neighboring clusters and their signal contamination to the filament region. We report the direct imaging and spectroscopic detection of extended thermal WHIM emission from this single filament. Our imaging analysis confirms the existence of $(21\pm 3)\% $ excess X-ray emission throughout the filament compared to the sky background at a $6.1\sigma$ level. We constrain the filament gas temperature, electron density, and baryon overdensity to be $k_{\text{B}}T\approx (0.8-1.1)$ keV, $n_{\text{e}}\approx 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\delta_{\text{b}}\approx (30-40)$, respectively, at a $&gt;3\sigma$ detection level, in agreement with cosmological simulations for the first time for a single filament. Independent of the X-ray analysis, we also identify a spectroscopic galaxy overdensity throughout the filament using the Shapley Supercluster velocity Database and constrain the filament's 3D length to be 7.2 Mpc. Overall, this is the first X-ray spectroscopic detection of pure WHIM emission from an individual, pristine filament without significant contamination from unresolved point sources and gas clumps.</description>

      <title>Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Extended datasamples under the lens of Brane World Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a "Big Rip" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray line emission from hot gas in intervening galaxy halos and diffuse gas in the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.</description>

      <title>Could We Be Fooled about Phantom Crossing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI Year 2 BAO, Planck CMB, and various supernova compilations suggest a preference for evolving dark energy, with hints that the equation of state may cross the phantom divide line ($w = -1$). While this behavior is seen in both parametric and non-parametric reconstructions, comparing reconstructions that support such behavior (such as the best fit of CPL) with those that maintain $w&gt;-1$ (like the best fit algebraic quintessence) is not straightforward, as they differ in flexibility and structure, and are not necessarily nested within one another. Thus, the question remains as to whether the crossing behavior that we observe, suggested by the data, truly represents a dark energy model that crosses the phantom divide line, or if it could instead be a result of data fluctuations and the way the data are distributed. We investigate the likelihood of this possibility. For this analysis we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on a fiducial algebraic quintessence model. We find that in $3.2 \% $ of cases, CPL with phantom crossing not only fits better, but exceeds the real-data $\chi^2$ improvement. This Monte Carlo approach quantifies to what extent statistical fluctuations and the specific distribution of the data could fool us into thinking the phantom divide line is crossed, when it is not. Although evolving dark energy remains a robust signal, and crossing $w=-1$ a viable phenomenological solution that seems to be preferred by the data, its precise behavior requires deeper investigation with more precise data.</description>

      <title>The effects of continuum fitting on Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations of fluctuations of the flux in Lyman-$\alpha$ forests of high-redshift quasars have been observed by the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey (BOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) survey where they have revealed the effects of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). In order to fit the correlation functions to a physical model and thereby constrain cosmological parameters, it is necessary to take into account the effects of fitting the observed spectra to a template about which the fluctuations are measured. In this paper we use mock spectra to test the distortion matrix technique that has been used since the final BOSS data release to appropriately distort the models. We show that while percent-level effects on the derived forest bias parameters may be present, the technique works sufficiently well that the determination of the BAO peak position is not affected at the percent level. We introduce modifications in the technique used by DESI that were not in the original applications and suggest further possibilities for improvements.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI: the role of local connectivity in star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first statistical observational study detecting small-scale filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* $&gt; 10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and reference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy connectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with stellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between connectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with the cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to local filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy connectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic curl -- Features and convergence of the vorticity power spectrum in $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the cosmic velocity field could become an important cosmological probe in the near future. To take advantage of future velocity-flow surveys we must however have the theoretical predictions under control. In many respects, the velocity field is easier to simulate than the density field because it is less severely affected by small-scale clustering. Therefore, as we also show in this paper, a particle-mesh (PM) based simulation approach is usually sufficient, yielding results within a few percent of a corresponding P$^3$M simulation in which short-range forces are properly accounted for, but which also carry a much larger computational cost.
  However, in other respects the velocity field is much more challenging to deal with than the density field: Interpolating the velocity field onto a grid is significantly more complicated, and the vorticity field (the curl-part of the velocity field) is severely affected by both sample variance and discretisation effects. While the former can be dealt with using fixed amplitude initial conditions, the former makes it infeasible to run fully converged simulations in a cosmological volume. However, using the $N$-body code CONCEPT we show that one can robustly extrapolate the cosmic vorticity power spectrum from just 4 simulations with different number of particles. We expect our extrapolated vorticity power spectra to be correct within 5\% of the fully converged result across three orders of magnitude in $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes are 5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit well-established mechanisms for primordial black hole (PBH) production, namely inflation, phase transitions, and cosmic strings, in the context of the Dark Dimension Scenario, which is motivated by Swampland principles. Applying quantum gravity constraints, we demonstrate that any viable mechanism, barring exotic new physics at low energies, inevitably leads to the formation of five-dimensional PBHs. We further show that PBHs formed from cosmic strings can have lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe. We comment on the observational implications of this result, including a potential connection to the recent detection of a high-energy neutrino by KM3NeT, whose energy is intriguingly close to the five-dimensional Planck scale in the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $\theta$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant population of quasars have been found to exist within the first Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here, based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the first population of quiescent galaxies.</description>

      <title>GalaxyGenius: A Mock Galaxy Image Generator for Various Telescopes from Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys, we introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely-used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate desired mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, We create a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared wavelength coverages, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework developed to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research, and they can also act as training sets for deep learning relevant studies where real observational data are insufficient.</description>

      <title>EMUSE: Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EMUSE (Evolutionary Map of the Universe Search Engine), a tool designed for searching specific radio sources within the extensive datasets of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey, with potential applications to other Big Data challenges in astronomy. Built on a multimodal approach to radio source classification and retrieval, EMUSE fine-tunes the OpenCLIP model on curated radio galaxy datasets. Leveraging the power of foundation models, our work integrates visual and textual embeddings to enable efficient and flexible searches within large radio astronomical datasets. We fine-tune OpenCLIP using a dataset of 2,900 radio galaxies, encompassing various morphological classes, including FR-I, FR-II, FR-x, R-type, and other rare and peculiar sources. The model is optimized using adapter-based fine-tuning, ensuring computational efficiency while capturing the unique characteristics of radio sources. The fine-tuned model is then deployed in EMUSE, allowing for seamless image- and text-based queries over the EMU survey dataset. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in retrieving and classifying radio sources, particularly in recognizing distinct morphological features. However, challenges remain in identifying rare or previously unseen radio sources, highlighting the need for expanded datasets and continuous refinement. This study showcases the potential of multimodal machine learning in radio astronomy, paving the way for more scalable and accurate search tools in the field. The search engine is accessible at https://askap-emuse.streamlit.app/ and can be used locally by cloning the repository at https://github.com/Nikhel1/EMUSE.</description>

      <title>Joint Semi-Analytic Multipole Priors from Galaxy Isophotes and Constraints from Lensed Arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars are sensitive to the imprint of low-mass dark-matter haloes. The reliability of detection depends on the robustness of the smooth mass model. Optical surveys show that massive early-type galaxies similar to galaxy-scale gravitational lenses depart from perfect ellipticity, exhibiting $m=3$ and $m=4$ multipole distortions. We construct the semi-analytic, five-dimensional joint population prior for the $m=3$ and $m=4$ amplitude and orientation as well as the axis ratio of the deflector, calibrated on the sample of 840 SDSS E/S0 galaxies. The parameters are fitted via hierarchical Bayesian modeling, minimizing a joint Jensen-Shannon divergence between model and data. We use this prior to model the mass distribution of mock lenses with HST quality data with different multipole amplitudes. We find that we robustly measure the true multipole amplitudes and orientations. Compared to fits that use only the four point-image positions, adding the lensed host-galaxy arcs tightens the 68 % credible regions of multipole parameters by factors of 3-12 and reduces the predicted flux-ratio uncertainties by a mean factor of ~6. This analysis does not include substructure or a complex source, and thus can be considered an upper limit on the expected improvement. The combination of arc information and realistic multipole priors therefore yields an order-of-magnitude improvement in smooth mass model precision, paving the way for more robust measurements of dark-matter substructure.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Very Early Dark Energy in the Matter Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like scalar fields can induce temporary deviations from the standard expansion history of the universe. The scalar field's contribution to the energy density of the universe grows while the field is held constant by Hubble friction, but when the scalar field starts to evolve, its energy density decreases faster than the radiation density for some potentials. We explore the observational signatures of such a scalar field that becomes dynamical between big bang nucleosynthesis and matter-radiation equality, which we call very Early Dark Energy (vEDE). If vEDE momentarily dominates the energy density of the universe, it generates a distinctive feature in the matter power spectrum that includes a bump on scales that enter the horizon just after the scalar field starts to evolve. For $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, the amplitude of this bump can exceed the amplitude of the standard matter spectrum. The power on scales on either side of this peak is suppressed relative to the standard power spectrum, but only scales that are within the horizon while the scalar field makes a significant contribution to the total energy density are affected. We determine how vEDE scenarios are constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background, measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, and probes of the late-time expansion history. We find that these observations are consistent with vEDE scenarios that enhance power on scales $k \gtrsim 30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and nearly double the amplitude of the matter power spectrum around $200\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. These scenarios also suppress power on scales between $0.3\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $30\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter searches from the standard halo over the tidal stream to the big flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of axion dark matter searches depends on the signal window that results from the velocity dispersion of axion dark matter. Since the ratio of signal windows is about 6500 between the standard halo and the big flow axion dark matter, each axion dark matter search usually uses a separate data acquisition (DAQ) channel with a different frequency resolution bandwidth (RBW). In this work, we demonstrate axion dark matter searches covering the standard halo, the tidal stream, and the big flow employing a DAQ channel starting with a single high resolution RBW, without sacrificing the DAQ efficiency, where the DAQ process includes online fast Fourier transforms and writing the outputs to disk. Assuming the total amount of data is sensitive to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii (DFSZ) axion dark matter that follows the standard halo model and makes up 100\% of the local dark matter density, the same data can also be used for the tidal stream and the big flow axion dark matter searches that would be sensitive to DFSZ axion dark matter that constitute 19.2\% and 12.4\% of the local dark matter densities, respectively, at a 90\% confidence level. We also report that the filtering of the individual power spectra acquired with a relatively high resolution RBW e.g., for the big flow search can prevent a possible significant degradation in the signal to noise ratio from the searches in the lower resolution RBW's, i.e., the standard halo and tidal stream searches.</description>

      <title>Light in the dark forest -- I. An efficient optimal estimator for 3D Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly anisotropic nature of the Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest data introduces a complex survey window function that complicates the measurement of the three-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{3D}}$). In this paper, we present the first fully optimal estimator for $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$, which exactly deconvolves the survey window function and marginalizes contaminated modes that distort the power spectrum. Our approach adapts optimal estimator techniques developed for the 2D cosmic microwave background data to the 3D case. To achieve computational feasibility, we employ the conjugate gradient method and implement the P$^3$M formalism to handle large-scale and small-scale operations separately and efficiently. We validate our estimator using Monte Carlo mocks and Gaussian simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and computational efficiency. We confirm that mode marginalization eliminates distortions arising from quasar continuum errors and delivers robust power spectrum estimation, though it also inflates errors at large scales. This first implementation works in the flat sky case; we discuss the remaining steps needed to generalize to the curved sky. This formalism offers a foundation for the Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{3D}}$ measurements and a new path toward cosmological constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest data.</description>

      <title>A G_2G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06654v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework is developed within an eleven-dimensional M-theory scenario where dynamical geometric moduli, originating from a $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-holonomy compactification, generate an evolving cosmological term, $\Lambda(z)$. This ``Geometric Vacuum Energy'' (GVE) is shown to be consistent across both cosmological and astrophysical scales. We demonstrate that a natural attractor solution alleviates the Hubble tension, yielding an inferred $H_0 \approx 69.4\ \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and a suppressed structure growth parameter $S_8 \approx 0.67$, while remaining in excellent agreement with cosmic chronometer data ($\chi^2/N \approx 0.44$). Its predictions in the strong-gravity regime profoundly strengthen the framework's self-consistency. We show that this model supports stable, hairy black hole solutions whose existence conditions are congruent with the cosmological attractor ($\Phi_{\text{horizon}} \leftrightarrow \Phi_{\text{cosmology}}$). Furthermore, these objects exhibit a rich, falsifiable phenomenology, including (i) the definitive breaking of isospectrality in their gravitational-wave quasi-normal modes, (ii) a suppressed Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and (iii) unique thermodynamic and electromagnetic accretion signatures. These interconnected findings highlight a pathway where a single, theoretically-motivated framework can naturally reconcile multiple observational puzzles.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the High Column Density systems in The Lyman-Alpha Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} &gt; 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) with log NHI/1cm^{-2} &gt; 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.</description>

Abstract: In the search for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) of cosmological origin with LISA, it is crucial to account for realistic complications in the noise and astrophysical foreground modeling that may impact the signal reconstruction. To address these challenges, we updated the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code to incorporate both variable noise levels across LISA arms and more complex foreground spectral shapes. Our findings suggest that, while moderate variations of the noise amplitudes have a minimal impact, poor foreground modeling (i.e., templates requiring many free parameters) significantly degrades the reconstruction of cosmological signals. This underlines the importance of accurate modeling and subtraction of the astrophysical foregrounds to characterize possible cosmological components. To perform this more challenging analysis, we have integrated the $\texttt{JAX}$ framework, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of the code, in the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code, enabling faster Bayesian likelihood sampling and more effective exploration of complex SGWB signals.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01551</link>

Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to the advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper secondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This contribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course for upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched during the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course aimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while highlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning materials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while systematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper secondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active learning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging applications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought experiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore whether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course could be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students. A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes, including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of science. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with large to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles. Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed. We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary physics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging, comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.</description>

      <title>Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.
  We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.
  The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</description>

      <title>2024 TASI Lectures: A Dark Matter Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on a sequence of 4 lectures delivered at the 2024 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI) and at the Universit\`a degli Studi di Padova. They are intended for graduate students at the early stages of their study of dark matter with some prior exposure to cosmology and quantum field theory. The primary aim is to offer an accessible introduction to dark matter and to lay the groundwork for exploring its phenomenology. These lectures are not intended to serve as a comprehensive review. We begin by motivating the study of dark matter through a discussion of the empirical evidence and the constraints it places on dark matter properties. This is followed by an overview of several canonical mechanisms for the production of cosmological dark matter, and a concluding section that surveys current experimental and observational efforts to detect it with a focus on direct detection.</description>
