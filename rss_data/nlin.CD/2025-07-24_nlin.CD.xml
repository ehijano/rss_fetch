      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>Generalized Adaptation-Induced Non-universal Synchronization Transitions in Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of partial order parameter adaptation in form of general functions on the synchronization behavior of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on top of random hypergraph models. The interactions between the oscillators are considered as pairwise and triangular. Using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a set of self-consistent equations of the order parameter that describe the synchronization diagrams. A broad diversity of synchronization transitions are observed as a result of the interaction between the partial adaptation approach, generalized adaptation functions, and coupling strengths. The system specifically shows a double-jump transition under a power-law form of the adaptation function. A polynomial form of the adaptation function leads to the emergence of an intermediate synchronization state for specific combinations of one negative and one positive coefficient. Moreover, the synchronization transition may become continuous or explosive when the pairwise coupling strength varies. The generality of this synchronization behavior is further supported by results obtained using a Gaussian adaptation function.</description>

      <title>Contraction, Criticality, and Capacity: A Dynamical-Systems Perspective on Echo-State Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property (geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds, covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the \textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully trained recurrent networks in practice.</description>
