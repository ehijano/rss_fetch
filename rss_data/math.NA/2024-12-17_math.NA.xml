      <title>Error Estimation and Stopping Criteria for Krylov-Based Model Order Reduction in Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on the frequency range of interest, finite element-based modeling of acoustic problems leads to dynamical systems with very high dimensional state spaces. As these models can mostly be described with second order linear dynamical system with sparse matrices, mathematical model order reduction provides an interesting possibility to speed up the simulation process. In this work, we tackle the question of finding an optimal order for the reduced system, given a desired accuracy. To do so, we revisit a heuristic error estimator based on the difference of two reduced models from two consecutive Krylov iterations. We perform a mathematical analysis of the estimator and show that the difference of two consecutive reduced models does provide a sufficiently accurate estimation for the true model reduction error. This claim is supported by numerical experiments on two acoustic models. We briefly discuss its feasibility as a stopping criterion for Krylov-based model order reduction.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz methods for t-product tensor linear systems with factorized operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized iterative algorithms, such as the randomized Kaczmarz method, have gained considerable popularity due to their efficacy in solving matrix-vector and matrix-matrix regression problems. Our present work leverages the insights gained from studying such algorithms to develop regression methods for tensors, which are the natural setting for many application problems, e.g., image deblurring. In particular, we extend the randomized Kaczmarz method to solve a tensor system of the form $\mathbf{\mathcal{A}}\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ can be factorized as $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{U}\mathcal{V}$, and all products are calculated using the t-product. We develop variants of the randomized factorized Kaczmarz method for matrices that approximately solve tensor systems in both the consistent and inconsistent regimes. We provide theoretical guarantees of the exponential convergence rate of our algorithms, accompanied by illustrative numerical simulations. Furthermore, we situate our method within a broader context by linking our novel approaches to earlier randomized Kaczmarz methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal approximation of a large matrix by a sum of projected linear mappings on prescribed subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and justify a matrix reduction method for calculating the optimal approximation of an observed matrix $A \in {\mathbb C}^{m \times n}$ by a sum $\sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q B_iX_{ij}C_j$ of matrix products where each $B_i \in {\mathbb C}^{m \times g_i}$ and $C_j \in {\mathbb C}^{h_j \times n}$ is known and where the unknown matrix kernels $X_{ij}$ are determined by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the error. The sum can be represented as a bounded linear mapping $BXC$ with unknown kernel $X$ from a prescribed subspace ${\mathcal T} \subseteq {\mathbb C}^n$ onto a prescribed subspace ${\mathcal S} \subseteq {\mathbb C}^m$ defined respectively by the collective domains and ranges of the given matrices $C_1,\ldots,C_q$ and $B_1,\ldots,B_p$. We show that the optimal kernel is $X = B^{\dag}AC^{\dag}$ and that the optimal approximation $BB^{\dag}AC^{\dag}C$ is the projection of the observed mapping $A$ onto a mapping from ${\mathcal T}$ to ${\mathcal S}$. If $A$ is large $B$ and $C$ may also be large and direct calculation of $B^{\dag}$ and $C^{\dag}$ becomes unwieldy and inefficient. { The proposed method avoids} this difficulty by reducing the solution process to finding the pseudo-inverses of a collection of much smaller matrices. This significantly reduces the computational burden.</description>

      <title>Weak formulation and spectral approximation of a Fokker-Planck equation for neural ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on efficiently and flexibly simulating the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the Nonlinear Noisy Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (NNLIF) model, which reflects the dynamic behavior of neuron networks. We apply the Galerkin spectral method to discretize the spatial domain by constructing a variational formulation that satisfies complex boundary conditions. Moreover, the boundary conditions in the variational formulation include only zeroth-order terms, with first-order conditions being naturally incorporated. This allows the numerical scheme to be further extended to an excitatory-inhibitory population model with synaptic delays and refractory states. Additionally, we establish the consistency of the numerical scheme. Experimental results, including accuracy tests, blow-up events, and periodic oscillations, validate the properties of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses an optimal control problem constrained by a degenerate kinetic equation of parabolic-hyperbolic type. Using a hypocoercivity framework we establish the well-posedness of the problem and demonstrate that the optimal solutions exhibit a hypocoercive decay property, ensuring stability and robustness. Building on this framework, we develop a finite element discretisation that preserves the stability properties of the continuous system. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a series of numerical experiments, showcasing its ability to handle challenging PDE-constrained optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximations of some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximations of some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. We prove weak convergence of optimal order 1/4 for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions of the scheme by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. Boundary-preservation is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing methods for SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Discontinuous Galerkin Approximations to the Vlasov-Unsteady Stokes System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, uniqueness of strong solution is established for the Vlasov-unsteady Stokes problem in 3D. The second part deals with a semi discrete scheme, which is based on the coupling of discontinuous Galerkin approximations for the Vlasov and the Stokes equations for the 2D problem. The proposed method is both mass and momentum conservative. Based on a special projection and also the Stokes projection, optimal error estimates in the case of smooth compactly supported initial data are derived. Moreover, the generalization of error estimates to 3D problem is also indicated. Finally, based on time splitting algorithm, some numerical experiments are conducted whose results confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Predictor-corrector, BGN-based parametric finite element methods for surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel parametric finite element approach for simulating the surface diffusion of curves and surfaces. Our core strategy incorporates a predictor-corrector time-stepping method, which enhances the classical first-order temporal accuracy to achieve second-order accuracy. Notably, our new method eliminates the necessity for mesh regularization techniques, setting it apart from previously proposed second-order schemes by the authors (J. Comput. Phys. 514 (2024) 113220). Moreover, it maintains the long-term mesh equidistribution property of the first-order scheme. The proposed techniques are readily adaptable to other geometric flows, such as (area-preserving) curve shortening flow and surface diffusion with anisotropic surface energy. Comprehensive numerical experiments have been conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed methods, demonstrating their superiority over previous schemes.</description>

      <title>Matrix-free implementation of the non-nested multigrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, the geometric multigrid method is used with nested levels. However, the construction of a suitable hierarchy for very fine and unstructured grids is, in general, highly non-trivial. In this scenario, the non-nested multigrid method could be exploited in order to handle the burden of hierarchy generation, allowing some flexibility on the choice of the levels. We present a parallel, matrix-free, implementation of the non-nested multigrid method for continuous Lagrange finite elements, where each level may consist of independently partitioned triangulations. Our algorithm has been added to the multigrid framework of the C++ finite-element library deal.II. Several 2D and 3D numerical experiments are presented, ranging from Poisson problems to linear elasticity. We test the robustness and performance of the proposed implementation with different polynomial degrees and geometries.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Stability and Accuracy in Partitioned Methods with Algebraic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partitioned approach for the numerical integration of power system differential algebraic equations faces inherent numerical stability challenges due to delays between the computation of state and algebraic variables. Such delays can compromise solution accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale system simulations. We present an $O(h^2)$-accurate prediction scheme for algebraic variables based on forward and backward difference formulas, applied before the correction step of numerical integration. The scheme improves the numerical stability of the partitioned approach while maintaining computational efficiency. Through numerical simulations on a lightly damped single machine infinite bus system and a large-scale 140-bus network, we demonstrate that the proposed method, when combined with variable time-stepping, significantly enhances the numerical stability, solution accuracy, and computational performance of the simulation. Results show reduced step rejections, fewer nonlinear solver iterations, and improved accuracy compared to conventional approaches, making the method particularly valuable for large-scale power system dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>FBSJNN: A Theoretically Interpretable and Efficiently Deep Learning method for Solving Partial Integro-Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving a class of Partial Integro-Differential Equations (PIDEs) and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Jumps (FBSDEJs) through a deep learning-based approach. This method, termed the Forward-Backward Stochastic Jump Neural Network (FBSJNN), is both theoretically interpretable and numerically effective. Theoretical analysis establishes the convergence of the numerical scheme and provides error estimates grounded in the universal approximation properties of neural networks. In comparison to existing methods, the key innovation of the FBSJNN framework is that it uses a single neural network to approximate both the solution of the PIDEs and the non-local integral, leveraging Taylor expansion for the latter. This enables the method to reduce the total number of parameters in FBSJNN, which enhances optimization efficiency. Numerical experiments indicate that the FBSJNN scheme can obtain numerical solutions with a relative error on the scale of $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on addressing the challenge of solving the reduced biquaternion equality constrained least squares (RBLSE) problem. We develop algebraic techniques to derive both complex and real solutions for the RBLSE problem by utilizing the complex and real forms of reduced biquaternion matrices. Additionally, we conduct a perturbation analysis for the RBLSE problem and establish an upper bound for the relative forward error of these solutions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and to verify the accuracy of the established upper bound for the relative forward errors.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for imposing non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow, addressing three scenarios: electrically insulating walls, thin walls with finite conductivity, and perfectly conducting walls. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term operators. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions is coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators) on high-order unstructured grids are used to demonstrate the new procedure's accuracy, robustness, and efficacy for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, nodal and modal discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.</description>

      <title>An explicit spectral decomposition of the ADRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate discrete Radon transform (ADRT) is a hierarchical multiscale approximation of the Radon transform. In this paper, we factor the ADRT into a product of linear transforms that resemble convolutions, and derive an explicit spectral decomposition of each factor. We further show that this implies - for data lying in the range of the ADRT - that the transform of an $N \times N$ image can be formally inverted with complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log^2 N)$. We numerically test the accuracy of the inverse on images of moderate sizes and find that it is competitive with existing iterative algorithms in this special regime.</description>

      <title>An FFT-accelerated PML-BIE Solver for Three-Dimensional Acoustic Wave Scattering in Layered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with three-dimensional acoustic wave scattering in two-layer media, where the two homogeneous layers are separated by a locally perturbed plane featuring an axially symmetric perturbation. A fast novel boundary integral equation (BIE) method is proposed to solve the scattering problem within a cylindrical perfectly matched layer (PML) truncation. We use PML-transformed Green's functions to derive BIEs in terms of single- and double-layer potentials for the wave field and its normal derivative on the boundary of each truncated homogeneous region. These BIEs, combined with interface and PML boundary conditions, form a complete system that accurately approximates the scattering problem. An FFT-based approach is introduced to efficiently and accurately discretize the surface integral operators in the BIEs, where a new kernel splitting technique is developed to resolve instabilities arising from the complex arguments in Green's functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, as well as the exponential decay of truncation errors introduced by the PML.</description>

      <title>Simplified Weak Galerkin Finite Element Methods for Biharmonic Equations on Non-Convex Polytopal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simplified weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for solving biharmonic equations avoiding the use of traditional stabilizers. The proposed WG method supports both convex and non-convex polytopal elements in finite element partitions, utilizing bubble functions as a critical analytical tool. The simplified WG method is symmetric and positive definite. Optimal-order error estimates are established for WG approximations in both the discrete $H^2$ norm and the $L^2$ norm.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities: a review on proofs, equivalent formulations, and behavior of constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate discrete Poincar\'e inequalities on piecewise polynomial subspaces of the Sobolev spaces H(curl) and H(div) in three space dimensions. We characterize the dependence of the constants on the continuous-level constants, the shape regularity and cardinality of the underlying tetrahedral mesh, and the polynomial degree. One important focus is on meshes being local patches (stars) of tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedral mesh. We also review various equivalent results to the discrete Poincar\'e inequalities, namely stability of discrete constrained minimization problems, discrete inf-sup conditions, bounds on operator norms of piecewise polynomial vector potential operators (Poincar\'e maps), and existence of graph-stable commuting projections.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori analysis of the discontinuous Galerkin approximation of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations under minimal regularity assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) approximation of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. Specifically, we consider an interior penalty dG method, and establish error estimates that are valid under minimal regularity assumptions and involving constants that do not depend on the frequency for sufficiently fine meshes. The key result of our a priori error analysis is that the dG solution is asymptotically optimal in an augmented energy norm that contains the dG stabilization. Specifically, up to a constant that tends to one as the mesh is refined, the dG solution is as accurate as the best approximation in the same norm. The main insight is that the quantities controlling the smallness of the mesh size are essentially those already appearing in the conforming setting. We also show that for fine meshes, the inf-sup stability constant is as good as the continuous one up to a factor two. Concerning the a posteriori analysis, we consider a residual-based error estimator under the assumption of piecewise constant material properties. We derive a global upper bound and local lower bounds on the error with constants that (i) only depend on the shape-regularity of the mesh if it is sufficiently refined and (ii) are independent of the stabilization bilinear form.</description>

      <title>On orthogonality sampling method for Maxwell's equations and its applications to experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem for Maxwell's equations. We first show that a bianisotropic scatterer can be uniquely determined from multi-static far-field data through the factorization analysis of the far-field operator. Next, we investigate a modified version of the orthogonality sampling method, as proposed in \cite{Le2022}, for the numerical reconstruction of the scatterer. Finally, we apply this sampling method to invert unprocessed 3D experimental data obtained from the Fresnel Institute \cite{Geffrin2009}. Numerical examples with synthetic scattering data for bianisotropic targets are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>How to avoid order reduction in third-order exponential Runge--Kutta methods for problems with non-commutative operators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a subclass of exponential integrators, specifically explicit exponential Runge--Kutta methods. It is well known that third-order methods can suffer from order reduction when applied to linearized problems involving unbounded and non-commuting operators. In this work, we consider a fourth-stage third-order Runge--Kutta method, which successfully achieves the expected order of accuracy and avoids order reduction, as long as all required order conditions are satisfied. The convergence analysis is carried out under the assumption of higher regularity for the initial data. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Elucidating microstructural influences on fatigue behavior for additively manufactured Hastelloy X using Bayesian-calibrated crystal plasticity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity (CP) modeling is a vital tool for predicting the mechanical behavior of materials, but its calibration involves numerous (&gt;8) constitutive parameters, often requiring time-consuming trial-and-error methods. This paper proposes a robust calibration approach using Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify optimal CP model parameters under fatigue loading conditions. Utilizing cyclic data from additively manufactured Hastelloy X specimens at 500 degree-F, the BO framework, integrated with a Gaussian process surrogate model, significantly reduces the number of required simulations. A novel objective function is developed to match experimental stress-strain data across different strain amplitudes. Results demonstrate that effective CP model calibration is achieved within 75 iterations, with as few as 50 initial simulations. Sensitivity analysis reveals the influence of CP parameters at various loading points on the stress-strain curve. The results show that the stress-strain response is predominantly controlled by parameters related to yield, with increased influence from backstress parameters during compressive loading. In addition, the effect of introducing twins into the synthetic microstructure on fatigue behavior is studied, and a relationship between microstructural features and the fatigue indicator parameter is established. Results show that larger diameter grains, which exhibit a higher Schmid factor and an average misorientation of approximately 42 degrees +/- 1.67 degree, are identified as probable sites for failure. The proposed optimization framework can be applied to any material system or CP model, streamlining the calibration process and improving the predictive accuracy of such models.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Partial Boundary Data EIT Reconstructions using Direct Inversion CGO-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first partial boundary data complex geometrical optics based methods for electrical impedance tomography in three dimensions are developed, and tested, on simulated and experimental data. The methods provide good localization of targets for both absolute and time-difference imaging, when large portions of the domain are inaccessible for measurement. As most medical applications of electrical impedance tomography are limited to partial boundary data, the development of partial boundary algorithms is highly desirable. While iterative schemes have been used traditionally, their high computational cost makes them cost-prohibitive for applications that need fast imaging. The proposed algorithms require no iteration and provide informative absolute or time-difference images exceptionally quickly in under 2 seconds. Reconstructions are compared to reference reconstructions from standard linear difference imaging (30 seconds) and total variation regularized absolute imaging (several minutes) The algorithms perform well under high levels of noise and incorrect domain modeling.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra.
  These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formulas for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>On the low frequency flexural band gaps of a metamaterial plate with low porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates numerically and experimentally that it is possible to tailor flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime by appropriate choice of cutout characteristics. The finite element method is used to obtain the numerical dispersion relation and band gaps. The influence of the cutout's shape, size, and location on the band gap is systematically studied. The study demonstrates that the cutout should pass through the center of the unit cell, and a large aspect ratio is required to introduce flexural band gaps in the low-frequency regime. This is validated by experiments on a finite plate with 3 $\times$ 3 unit cells.</description>

      <title>ANaGRAM: A Natural Gradient Relative to Adapted Model for efficient PINNs learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have received strong interest as a method to solve PDE driven systems, in particular for data assimilation purpose. This method is still in its infancy, with many shortcomings and failures that remain not properly understood. In this paper we propose a natural gradient approach to PINNs which contributes to speed-up and improve the accuracy of the training. Based on an in depth analysis of the differential geometric structures of the problem, we come up with two distinct contributions: (i) a new natural gradient algorithm that scales as $\min(P^2S, S^2P)$, where $P$ is the number of parameters, and $S$ the batch size; (ii) a mathematically principled reformulation of the PINNs problem that allows the extension of natural gradient to it, with proved connections to Green's function theory.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Bounds for generative diffusion models with Gaussian tail targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generation of score-based generative models, assuming an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation of the score and a Gaussian-type tail behavior of the data distribution. The complexity bound in dimension is $O(\sqrt{d})$, with a logarithmic constant. Such Gaussian tail assumption applies to the distribution of a compact support target with early stopping technique and the Bayesian posterior with a bounded observation operator. Corresponding convergence and complexity bounds are derived.
  The crux of the analysis lies in the Lipchitz bound of the score, which is related to the Hessian estimate of a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation (vHJ). This latter is demonstrated by employing a dimension independent kernel estimate. Consequently, our complexity bound scales linearly (up to a logarithmic constant) with the square root of the trace of the covariance operator, which relates to the invariant distribution of forward process. Our analysis also extends to the probabilistic flow ODE, as the sampling process.</description>

      <title>A multilevel stochastic regularized first-order method with application to training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multilevel stochastic framework for the solution of optimization problems. The proposed approach uses random regularized first-order models that exploit an available hierarchical description of the problem, being either in the classical variable space or in the function space, meaning that different levels of accuracy for the objective function are available. The converge analysis of the method is conducted and its numerical behavior is tested on the solution of finite-sum minimization problems. Indeed, the multilevel framework is tailored to the solution of such problems resulting in fact in a nontrivial variance reduction technique with adaptive step-size that outperforms standard approaches when solving nonconvex problems. Differently from classical deterministic multilevel methods, our stochastic method does not require the finest approximation to coincide with the original objective function. This allows to avoid the evaluation of the full sum in finite-sum minimization problems, opening at the solution of classification problems with large data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have long been recognized as powerful tools for image processing and analysis, providing a framework to model and exploit structural and geometric properties inherent in visual data. Over the years, numerous PDE-based models have been developed and refined, inspired by natural analogies between physical phenomena and image spaces. These methods have proven highly effective in a wide range of applications, including denoising, deblurring, sharpening, inpainting, feature extraction, and others. This work provides a theoretical and computational exploration of both fundamental and innovative PDE models applied to image processing, accompanied by extensive numerical experimentation and objective and subjective analysis. Building upon well-established techniques, we introduce novel physical-based PDE models specifically designed for various image processing tasks. These models incorporate mathematical principles and approaches that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously applied in this domain, showcasing their potential to address challenges beyond the capabilities of traditional and existing PDE methods. By formulating and solving these mathematical models, we demonstrate their effectiveness in advancing image processing tasks while retaining a rigorous connection to their theoretical underpinnings. This work seeks to bridge foundational concepts and cutting-edge innovations, contributing to the evolution of PDE methodologies in digital image processing and related interdisciplinary fields.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}_m$ Interior Penalty Nonconforming Finite Element Methods for $2m$-th Order PDEs in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.07678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general $n$-dimensional simplicial meshes, we propose a family of interior penalty nonconforming finite element methods for $2m$-th order partial differential equations, where $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$. For this family of nonconforming finite elements, the shape function space consists of polynomials with a degree not greater than $m$, making it minimal. This family of finite element spaces exhibits natural inclusion properties, analogous to those in the corresponding Sobolev spaces in the continuous case. By applying interior penalty to the bilinear form, we establish quasi-optimal error estimates in the energy norm. Due to the weak continuity of the nonconforming finite element spaces, the interior penalty terms in the bilinear form take a simple form, and an interesting property is that the penalty parameter needs only to be a positive constant of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. These theoretical results are further validated by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Numerical Algorithm for $\alpha$-Dissipative Solutions of the Hunter-Saxton Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convergent numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation is derived. The method is based on applying a tailor-made projection operator to the initial data, and then solving exactly using the generalized method of characteristics. The projection step is the only step that introduces any approximation error. It is therefore crucial that its design ensures not only a good approximation of the initial data, but also that errors due to the energy dissipation at later times remain small. Furthermore, it is shown that the main quantity of interest, the wave profile, converges in $L^{\infty}$ for all $t \geq 0$, while a subsequence of the energy density converges weakly for almost every time.</description>

Abstract: In this work we develop an a posteriori error estimator for mixed finite element methods of Darcy flow problems with Robin-type jump interface conditions. We construct an energy-norm type a posteriori error estimator using the Stenberg post-processing. The reliability of the estimator is proved using an interface-adapted Helmholtz-type decomposition and an interface-adapted Scott--Zhang type interpolation operator. A local efficiency and the reliability of post-processed pressure are also proved. Numerical results illustrating adaptivity algorithms using our estimator are included.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Two-level MCMC with Deep Learning Surrogates for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inverse problems arise in various scientific and engineering domains, and solving them can be computationally demanding. This is especially the case for problems governed by partial differential equations, where the repeated evaluation of the forward operator is extremely expensive. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL)-based surrogate models have shown promising potential to accelerate the solution of such problems. However, despite their ability to learn from complex data, DL-based surrogate models generally cannot match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical models, which limits their practical applicability. We propose a novel hybrid two-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that combines the strengths of DL-based surrogate models and high-fidelity numerical solvers to solve Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. The intuition is to leverage the inference speed of a DL-based surrogate model as the base chain, and correct its errors using a limited number of high-fidelity numerical model evaluations in a correction chain; hence its name hybrid two-level MCMC method. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a pure numerical MCMC method while requiring only a small fraction of the computational cost. The theoretical analysis is further supported by several numerical experiments on the Poisson, reaction-diffusion, and Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed hybrid framework can be generalized to other approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter and sequential Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with solving the time fractional Vakhnenko Parkes equation using the reproducing kernels. Reproducing kernel theory, the normal basis, some important Hilbert spaces, homogenization of constraints, and the orthogonalization process are the main tools of this technique. The main advantage of reproducing kernel method is it is truly meshless. The solutions obtained by the implementation reproducing kernels Hilbert space method on the time-fractional Vakhnenko Parkes equation is in the form of a series. The obtained solution converges to the exact solution uniquely. It is observed that the implemented method is highly effective. The effectiveness of reproducing kernel Hilbert space method is presented through the tables and graphs. The perfectness of this method is tested by taking different error norms and the order of convergence of the errors.</description>

      <title>Proving the stability estimates of variational least-squares Kernel-Based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for the rigorous analysis of the numerical stability of variational least-squares kernel-based methods for solving second-order elliptic partial differential equations, we provide previously lacking stability inequalities. This fills a significant theoretical gap in the previous work [Comput. Math. Appl. 103 (2021) 1-11], which provided error estimates based on a conjecture on the stability. With the stability estimate now rigorously proven, we complete the theoretical foundations and compare the convergence behavior to the proven rates. Furthermore, we establish another stability inequality involving weighted-discrete norms, and provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that the exact quadrature weights are not necessary for the weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method to converge. Our novel theoretical insights are validated by numerical examples, which showcase the relative efficiency and accuracy of these methods on data sets with large mesh ratios. The results confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the performance of variational least-squares kernel-based method, least-squares kernel-based collocation method, and our new weighted least-squares kernel-based collocation method. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that all methods converge at the same rate, validating the convergence theory of weighted least-squares in our proven theories.</description>

      <title>A low-rank solver for conforming multipatch Isogeometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an innovative isogeometric low-rank solver for the linear elasticity model problem, specifically designed to allow multipatch domains. Our approach splits the domain into subdomains, each formed by the union of neighboring patches. Within each subdomain, we employ Tucker low-rank matrices and vectors to approximate the system matrices and right-hand side vectors, respectively. This enables the construction of local approximate fast solvers. These local solvers are then combined into an overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, which is utilized in a truncated preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant memory storage benefits and a uniformly bounded number of iterations with respect to both mesh size and spline degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study frequency domain electromagnetic scattering at a bounded, penetrable, and inhomogeneous obstacle $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $. From the Stratton-Chu integral representation, we derive a new representation formula when constant reference coefficients are given for the interior domain. The resulting integral representation contains the usual layer potentials, but also volume potentials on $\Omega$. Then it is possible to follow a single-trace approach to obtain boundary integral equations perturbed by traces of compact volume integral operators with weakly singular kernels. The coupled boundary and volume integral equations are discretized with a Galerkin approach with usual Curl-conforming and Div-conforming finite elements on the boundary and in the volume. Compression techniques and special quadrature rules for singular integrands are required for an efficient and accurate method. Numerical experiments provide evidence that our new formulation enjoys promising properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian systems provide an energy-based modeling paradigm for dynamical input-state-output systems. At their core, they fulfill an energy balance relating stored, dissipated and supplied energy. To accurately resolve this energy balance in time discretizations, we propose an adaptive grid refinement technique based on a posteriori error estimation. The evaluation of the error estimator includes the computation of adjoint sensitivities. To interpret this adjoint equation as a backwards-in-time equation, we show piecewise weak differentiability of the dual variable. Then, leveraging dissipativity of the port-Hamiltonian dynamics, we present a parallelizable approximation of the underlying adjoint system in the spirit of a block-Jacobi method to efficiently compute error indicators. We illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme by means of numerical experiments showing that it yields a smaller violation of the energy balance when compared to uniform refinements and traditional step-size controlled time stepping.</description>

      <title>A Variational Discretization Method for Mean Curvature Flows by the Onsager Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean curvature flow describes the evolution of a surface (a curve) with normal velocity proportional to the local mean curvature. It has many applications in mathematics, science and engineering. In this paper, we develop a numerical method for mean curvature flows by using the Onsager principle as an approximation tool. We first show that the mean curvature flow can be derived naturally from the Onsager variational principle. Then we consider a piecewise linear approximation of the curve and derive a discrete geometric flow. The discrete flow is described by a system of ordinary differential equations for the nodes of the discrete curve. We prove that the discrete system preserve the energy dissipation structure in the framework of the Onsager principle and this implies the energy decreasing property. The ODE system can be solved by the improved Euler scheme and this leads to an efficient fully discrete scheme. We first consider the method for a simple mean curvature flow and then extend it to the volume preserving mean curvature flow and also a wetting problem on substrates. Numerical examples show that the method has optimal convergence rate and works well for all the three problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a hybrid-type anisotropic weakly over-penalised symmetric interior penalty method for the Poisson equation on convex domains. Compared with the well-known hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods, our approach is simple and easy to implement. Our primary contributions are the proposal of a new scheme and the demonstration of a proof for the consistency term, which allows us to estimate the anisotropic consistency error. The key idea of the proof is to apply the relation between the Raviart--Thomas finite element space and a discontinuous space. In numerical experiments, we compare the calculation results for standard and anisotropic mesh partitions.</description>

      <title>Error Estimators for the Small-Biot Lumped Approximation for the Conduction Dunking Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dunking problem: a solid body at uniform temperature $T_{\text i}$ is placed in a environment characterized by farfield temperature $T_\infty$ and spatially uniform time-independent heat transfer coefficient. We permit heterogeneous material composition: spatially dependent density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Mathematically, the problem is described by a heat equation with Robin boundary conditions. The crucial parameter is the Biot number -- a nondimensional heat transfer (Robin) coefficient; we consider the limit of small Biot number.
  We introduce first-order and second-order asymptotic approximations (in Biot number) for several quantities of interest, notably the spatial domain average temperature as a function of time; the first-order approximation is simply the standard engineering `lumped' model. We then provide asymptotic error estimates for the first-order and second-order approximations for small Biot number, and also, for the first-order approximation, alternative strict bounds valid for all Biot number. Companion numerical solutions of the heat equation confirm the effectiveness of the error estimates for small Biot number.
  The second-order approximation and the first-order and second-order error estimates depend on several functional outputs associated to an elliptic partial differential equation; the latter is derived from Biot-sensitivity analysis of the heat equation eigenproblem in the limit of small Biot number. Most important is $\phi$, the only functional output required for the first-order error estimates; $\phi$ admits a simple physical interpretation in terms of conduction length scale. We investigate the domain and property dependence of $\phi$: most notably, we characterize spatial domains for which the standard lumped-model error criterion -- Biot number (based on volume-to-area length scale) small -- is deficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a Tikhonov regularization scheme specifically tailored for shallow neural networks within the context of solving a classic inverse problem: approximating an unknown function and its derivatives within a unit cubic domain based on noisy measurements. The proposed Tikhonov regularization scheme incorporates a penalty term that takes three distinct yet intricately related network (semi)norms: the extended Barron norm, the variation norm, and the Radon-BV seminorm. These choices of the penalty term are contingent upon the specific architecture of the neural network being utilized. We establish the connection between various network norms and particularly trace the dependence of the dimensionality index, aiming to deepen our understanding of how these norms interplay with each other. We revisit the universality of function approximation through various norms, establish rigorous error-bound analysis for the Tikhonov regularization scheme, and explicitly elucidate the dependency of the dimensionality index, providing a clearer understanding of how the dimensionality affects the approximation performance and how one designs a neural network with diverse approximating tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and robust numerical method for reconstructing point-like sources in the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations given Cauchy data at a fixed frequency. This is an electromagnetic inverse source problem with broad applications, such as antenna synthesis and design, medical imaging, and pollution source tracing. We introduce new imaging functions and a computational algorithm to determine the number of point sources, their locations, and associated moment vectors, even when these vectors have notably different magnitudes. The number of sources and locations are estimated using significant peaks of the imaging functions, and the moment vectors are computed via explicitly simple formulas. The theoretical analysis and stability of the imaging functions are investigated, where the main challenge lies in analyzing the behavior of the dot products between the columns of the imaginary part of the Green's tensor and the unknown moment vectors. Additionally, we extend our method to reconstruct small-volume sources using an asymptotic expansion of their radiated electric field. We provide numerical examples in three dimensions to demonstrate the performance of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new variant of the GMRES method is presented for solving linear systems with the same matrix and subsequently obtained multiple right-hand sides. The new method keeps such properties of the classical GMRES algorithm as follows. Both bases of the search space and its image are maintained orthonormal that increases the robustness of the method. Moreover there is no need to store both bases since they are effectively represented within a common basis. Along with it our method is theoretically equivalent to the GCR method extended for a case of multiple right-hand sides but is more numerically robust and requires less memory.
  The main result of the paper is a mechanism of adding an arbitrary direction vector to the search space that can be easily adopted for flexible GMRES or GMRES with deflated restarting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed node-based uniform strain virtual element method (NVEM) is here extended to small strain elastoplastic solids. In the proposed method, the strain is averaged at the nodes from the strain of surrounding linearly-precise virtual elements using a generalization to virtual elements of the node-based uniform strain approach for finite elements. The averaged strain is then used to sample the weak form at the nodes of the mesh leading to a method in which all the field variables, including state and history-dependent variables, are related to the nodes and thus they are tracked only at these locations during the nonlinear computations. Through various elastoplastic benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the NVEM is locking-free while enabling linearly-precise virtual elements to solve elastoplastic solids with accuracy.</description>

      <title>Invertible ResNets for Inverse Imaging Problems: Competitive Performance with Provable Regularization Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving inverse problems, particularly in image reconstruction tasks. Despite their success, these approaches often lack theoretical guarantees, which are crucial in sensitive applications such as medical imaging. Recent works by Arndt et al (2023 Inverse Problems 39 125018, 2024 Inverse Problems 40 045021) addressed this gap by analyzing a data-driven reconstruction method based on invertible residual networks (iResNets). They revealed that, under reasonable assumptions, this approach constitutes a convergent regularization scheme. However, the performance of the reconstruction method was only validated on academic toy problems and small-scale iResNet architectures. In this work, we address this gap by evaluating the performance of iResNets on two real-world imaging tasks: a linear blurring operator and a nonlinear diffusion operator. To do so, we extend some of the theoretical results from Arndt et al to encompass nonlinear inverse problems and offer insights for the design of large-scale performant iResNet architectures. Through numerical experiments, we compare the performance of our iResNet models against state-of-the-art neural networks, confirming their efficacy. Additionally, we numerically investigate the theoretical guarantees of this approach and demonstrate how the invertibility of the network enables a deeper analysis of the learned forward operator and its learned regularization.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-dispersion analysis of fully-discrete implicit discontinuous Galerkin methods and application to stiff hyperbolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws requires a careful interplay between the space discretization, carried out with local polynomials and numerical fluxes at inter-cells, and a high-order time-integration to yield the final update. An important concern is how the scheme modifies the solution through the notions of numerical diffusion and dispersion. The analysis of these artifacts is well known for finite volume schemes, but it becomes more complex in the DG case. In particular, as far as we know, no analysis of this type has been considered for implicit integration with DG space discretization. The first part of this work intends to fill this gap, showing that the choice of the implicit Runge-Kutta scheme impacts deeply on the quality of the solution. We analyze dispersion-diffusion properties to select the best combination of the space-time discretization for high Courant numbers.
  In the second part of this work, we apply our findings to the integration of stiff hyperbolic systems with DG schemes. Implicit time-integration schemes leverage superior stability properties enabling the selection of time-steps based solely on accuracy requirements, thereby bypassing the need for minute time-steps. High-order schemes require the introduction of local space limiters which make the whole implicit scheme highly nonlinear. To mitigate the numerical complexity of these schemes, we propose to use appropriate space limiters that can be precomputed on a first-order prediction of the solution. This approach follows the methodology proposed by Puppo et al. (Commun. Comput. Phys., 2024) for high-order finite volume schemes. Numerical experiments explore the performance of this technique on scalar equations and systems.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of an Enhanced Finite Element Method for Mani\`a's Problem Exhibiting the Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that numerically approximating calculus of variations problems possessing a Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon (LGP) is challenging, and the standard numerical methodologies such as finite element, finite difference, and discontinuous Galerkin methods fail to give convergent methods because they cannot overcome the gap. This paper is a continuation of a 2018 paper by Feng-Schnake, where a promising enhanced finite element method was proposed to overcome the LGP in the classical Mani\`a's problem. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete $\Gamma$-convergence proof for this enhanced finite element method, hence establishing a theoretical foundation for the method. The crux of the convergence analysis is the construction of a new finite element interpolant that helps to build a recovery sequence for proving a $\Gamma$-convergence result due to its strong approximation properties in Sobolev spaces. Numerical tests are also provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of the von Neumann equation in the semi-classical limit. Part I : numerical algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to discretize the von Neumann equation, which is efficient in the semi-classical limit. This method is first based on the so called Weyl's variables to address the stiffness associated with the equation. Then, by applying a truncated Hermite expansion of the density operator, we successfully handle this stiffness. Additionally, we develop a finite volume approximation for practical implementation and conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the efficiency of our approach. This asymptotic preserving numerical approximation, combined with the use of Hermite polynomials, provides an efficient tool for solving the von Neumann equation in all regimes, near classical or not.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models for nonlinear ultrasound contrast imaging with microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound contrast imaging is a specialized imaging technique that applies microbubble contrast agents to traditional medical sonography, providing real-time visualization of blood flow and vessels. Gas-filled microbubbles are injected into the body, where they undergo compression and rarefaction and interact nonlinearly with the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the propagation of sound through a bubbly liquid is a strongly nonlinear problem that can be modeled by a nonlinear acoustic wave equation for the propagation of the pressure waves coupled via the source terms to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of Rayleigh-Plesset type for the bubble dynamics. In this work, we first derive a hierarchy of such coupled models based on constitutive laws. We then focus on the coupling of Westervelt's acoustic equation to Rayleigh-Plesset type equations, where we rigorously show the existence of solutions locally in time under suitable conditions on the initial pressure-microbubble data and final time. Thirdly, we devise and discuss numerical experiments on both single-bubble dynamics and the interaction of microbubbles with ultrasound waves.</description>

      <title>Martingale deep learning for very high dimensional quasi-linear partial differential equations and stochastic optimal controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve large-scale Hessian matrices, which are computationally expensive for deep learning methods relying on automatic differentiation to compute derivatives. This work aims to address this issue. In the proposed method, the PDE is reformulated into a martingale formulation, which allows the computation of loss functions to be derivative-free and parallelized in time-space domain. Then, the martingale formulation is enforced using a Galerkin method via adversarial learning techniques, which eliminate the need of computing conditional expectations in the margtingale property. This method is further extended to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and the associated Stochastic optimal control problems, enabling the simultaneous solution of the value function and optimal feedback control in a derivative-free manner. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, capable of solving HJB equations accurately with dimensionality up to 10,000.</description>
