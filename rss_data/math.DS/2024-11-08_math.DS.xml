      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have a nested toroidal structure, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Polynomial normal forms for ODEs near a center-saddle equilibrium point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a saddle-center equilibrium for general vector fields as well as Hamiltonian systems, and we transform it locally into a polynomial normal form in the saddle variables by a change of coordinates. This problem was first solved by Bronstein and Kopanskii in 1995, as well as by Banyaga, de la Llave and Wayne in 1996 [BLW] in the saddle case. The proof used relies on the deformation method used in [BLW], which in particular implies the preservation of the symplectic form for a Hamiltonian system, although our proof is different and, we believe, simpler. We also show that if the system has sign-symmetry, then the transformation can be chosen so that it also has sign-symmetry. This issue is important in our study of shadowing non-transverse heteroclinic chains (Delshams and Zgliczynski 2018 and 2024) for the toy model systems (TMS) of the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) on $2D$-torus or similar Hamiltonian PDE, which are used to prove energy transfer in these PDE.</description>

      <title>Non-singular and probability measure-preserving actions of infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two theorems in the ergodic theory of infinite permutation groups. First, generalizing a theorem of Nessonov for the infinite symmetric group, we show that every non-singular action of a non-archimedean, Roelcke precompact, Polish group on a measure space $(\Omega, \mu)$ admits an invariant $\sigma$-finite measure equivalent to $\mu$. Second, we prove the following de Finetti type theorem: if $G \curvearrowright M$ is a primitive permutation group with no algebraicity verifying an additional uniformity assumption, which is automatically satisfied if $G$ is Roelcke precompact, then any $G$-invariant, ergodic probability measure on $Z^M$, where $Z$ is a Polish space, is a product measure.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical systems from data: Gradient-based dictionary optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator plays a crucial role in analyzing the global behavior of dynamical systems. Existing data-driven methods for approximating the Koopman operator or discovering the governing equations of the underlying system typically require a fixed set of basis functions, also called dictionary. The optimal choice of basis functions is highly problem-dependent and often requires domain knowledge. We present a novel gradient descent-based optimization framework for learning suitable and interpretable basis functions from data and show how it can be used in combination with EDMD, SINDy, and PDE-FIND. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with the aid of various benchmark problems such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Chua's circuit, a nonlinear heat equation, as well as protein-folding data.</description>

      <title>Online learning in bifurcating dynamic systems via SINDy and Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for online data assimilation and update of a dynamic model, preliminary identified through the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). This data-driven technique may avoid biases due to incorrect modelling assumptions and exploits SINDy to approximate the system dynamics leveraging a predefined library of functions, where active terms are selected and weighted by a sparse set of coefficients. This results in a physically-sound and interpretable dynamic model allowing to reduce epistemic uncertainty often affecting machine learning approaches. Treating the SINDy model coefficients as random variables, we propose to update them while acquiring (possibly noisy) system measurements, thus enabling the online identification of time-varying systems. These changes can stem from, e.g., varying operational conditions or unforeseen events. The EKF performs model adaptation through joint state-parameters estimation, with the Jacobian matrices required to computed the model sensitivity inexpensively evaluated from the SINDy model formulation. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through three case studies: (i) a Lokta-Volterra model in which all parameters simultaneously evolve during the observation period; (ii) a Selkov model where the system undergoes a bifurcation not seen during the SINDy training; (iii) a MEMS arch exhibiting a 1:2 internal resonance. The ability of EKF of recovering inactivated functional terms from the SINDy library, or discarding unnecessary contribution, is also highlighted. Based on the presented applications, this method shows strong promise for handling time-varying nonlinear dynamic systems possibly experiencing bifurcating behaviours.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we define two concepts; random matrix and mean square stability. Studying the stability of solutions for perturbed random differential systems is included. Partial moments of the second order were verified, which determines the stability conditions of the studied systems, ensuring stability through Lyapunov functions. The differential equations that determine Lyapunov functions were obtained. The necessary conditions for Lyapunov matrices to ensure asymptotic stability were established.</description>

      <title>Baby Mandelbrot sets and Spines in some one-dimensional subspaces of the parameter space for generalized McMullen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions of the form $R_{n,c,a}(z) = z^n + \dfrac{a}{z^n}+c$,
  known as ``Generalized McMullen maps'', for $a\neq 0$ and $n \geq 3$ fixed, we study the boundedness locus in some one-dimensional slices of the $(a,c)$-parameter space, by fixing a parameter or imposing a relation.
  First, if we fix $c$ with $|c|\geq 6$ while allowing $a$ to vary, assuming a modest lower bound on $n$ in terms of $|c|$, we establish the location in the $a$-plane of $n$ ``baby" Mandelbrot sets, that is, homeomorphic copies of the original Mandelbrot set. We use polynomial-like maps, introduced by Douady and Hubbard and applied for the subfamily $R_{n,a,0}$ by Devaney.
  Second, for slices in which $c=ta$, we again observe what look like baby Mandelbrot sets within these slices, and begin the study of this subfamily by establishing a neighborhood containing the boundedness locus.</description>

Abstract: A geometric formulation of the linear beam dynamics in accelerator physics is presented. In particular, it is proved that the linear transverse and longitudinal dynamics can be interpret geometrically as an approximation to the Jacobi equation of an affine averaged Lorentz connection. We introduce a specific notion reference trajectory as integral curves of the main velocity vector field. A perturbation caused by the statistical nature of the bunch of particles is considered.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for geophysical fluid dynamics using generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation plays a crucial role in numerical modeling, enabling the integration of real-world observations into mathematical models to enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of simulations. This approach is widely applied in fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and environmental science, where the dynamic nature of systems demands continuous updates to model states. However, the calibration of models in these high-dimensional, nonlinear systems poses significant challenges. In this paper, we explore a novel calibration methodology using diffusion generative models. We generate synthetic data that statistically aligns with a given set of observations (in this case the increments of the numerical approximation of a solution of a partial differential equation). This allows us to efficiently implement a model reduction and assimilate data from a reference system state modeled by a highly resolved numerical solution of the rotating shallow water equation of order 104 degrees of freedom into a stochastic system having two orders of magnitude less degrees of freedom. To do so, the new samples are incorporated into a particle filtering methodology augmented with tempering and jittering for dynamic state estimation, a method particularly suited for handling complex and multimodal distributions. This work demonstrates how generative models can be used to improve the predictive accuracy for particle filters, providing a more computationally efficient solution for data assimilation and model calibration.</description>

      <title>The Recurrent Sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) is a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the classical Hidden Markov Model for learning from (spatio-)temporal data. A sticky HDP-HMM has been proposed to strengthen the self-persistence probability in the HDP-HMM. Then, disentangled sticky HDP-HMM has been proposed to disentangle the strength of the self-persistence prior and transition prior. However, the sticky HDP-HMM assumes that the self-persistence probability is stationary, limiting its expressiveness. Here, we build on previous work on sticky HDP-HMM and disentangled sticky HDP-HMM, developing a more general model: the recurrent sticky HDP-HMM (RS-HDP-HMM). We develop a novel Gibbs sampling strategy for efficient inference in this model. We show that RS-HDP-HMM outperforms disentangled sticky HDP-HMM, sticky HDP-HMM, and HDP-HMM in both synthetic and real data segmentation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Tuberculosis Outbreak Model in a Multi-scale Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation approaches for infectious disease dynamics have proven to be essential tools for effective control of the spread of epidemics in the population. Among these approaches, it is obvious that compartmental mathematical models, such as SIS, SIR, SEIR, etc. are the most widely used by researchers. However, they are difficult to apply in a multi-scale environment, especially if we want to take into account the heterogeneous behaviors of individuals. The aim of this paper is to present a hybrid model in which an Equation-Based Model (EBM) of tuberculosis dynamics is coupled to an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in a two-scale environment. In this model, individuals are placed in cities considered as agents in which the dynamics of the disease is modeled by eight compartments and managed by solving a system of differential equations. Individual agents move between these cities using an ABM that controls their mobility. Considering some parametric values and assumptions, the results obtained show that human mobility has a significant impact on the spread of tuberculosis within the population. The management of population and disease dynamics at different levels (microscopic and macroscopic) testifies to the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Singular stochastic delay equations driven by fractional Brownian motion: Dynamics, longtime behaviour, and pathwise stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differential equations with a linear, path dependent drift and discrete delay in the diffusion term driven by a $\gamma$-H\"older rough path for $\gamma &gt; \frac{1}{3}$. We prove well-posedness of these systems and establish a priori bounds for their solutions. Applying these results to an equation driven by a multidimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst paramter $H \in \big(\frac{1}{3},1\big)$, we can prove the existence of a Lyapunov spectrum for the linearized system that describes its long-time behaviour. Furthermore, we can deduce the existence of local stable, unstable, and center manifolds for the nonlinear equation. As an application, we can prove that under suitable conditions, the solution exhibits pathwise local exponential stability. En passant, we present new, concise and relatively short proofs for some classical results for $\mathcal{C}_0$-semigroups that build on the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem formulated on Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal vaccination strategies in the control of an infectious disease: a SEIRV model for administration of two vaccines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal control for an SEIR model adapted to the vaccination strategy of susceptible individuals. There are factors associated with a vaccination campaign that make this strategy not only a public health issue but also an economic one. In this case, optimal control is important as it minimizes implementation costs. We consider the availability of two vaccines with different efficacy levels, and the control indicates when each vaccine should be used. The optimal strategy specifies in all cases how vaccine purchases should be distributed. For similar efficacy values, we perform a sensitivity analysis on parameters that depend on the intrinsic characteristics of the vaccines. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of the number of infections under the optimal vaccination strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a modification of the self-attention dynamics proposed by Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) to better reflect the practically relevant, causally masked attention used in transformer architectures for generative AI. This modification translates into an interacting particle system that cannot be interpreted as a mean-field gradient flow. Despite this loss of structure, we significantly strengthen the results of Geshkovski et al. (arXiv:2312.10794) in this context: While previous rigorous results focused on cases where all three matrices (Key, Query, and Value) were scaled identities, we prove asymptotic convergence to a single cluster for arbitrary key-query matrices and a value matrix equal to the identity. Additionally, we establish a connection to the classical R\'enyi parking problem from combinatorial geometry to make initial theoretical steps towards demonstrating the existence of meta-stable states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that a geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points of genus greater than one is time-preserving semi-conjugate to a continuous expansive flow which is topologically mixing and has a local product structure. As an application we show that the geodesic flow of a compact surface without conjugate points of genus greater than one has a unique measure of maximal entropy. This gives an alternative proof of Climenhaga-Knieper-War Theorem.</description>

      <title>Reduced Data-Driven Turbulence Closure for Capturing Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, stochastic, a-posteriori, turbulence closure model based on a reduced subgrid scale term. This subgrid scale term is tailor-made to capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of interest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In contrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the "learning problem" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI. We use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar series over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction between the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate parametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for the scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural network, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives similar long-term statistics.</description>

      <title>Frozen planet orbits for the $n$-electron atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek periodic trajectories of a system of multiple mutually repelling electrons on a half-line, with an attractive nucleus sitting at the origin. We adopt a variational viewpoint and study critical points of the associated Lagrange-action functional, by means of a modified Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory for manifolds with boundary. Additionally, when the charges of the electrons tend to zero, we show that frozen planet orbits converge to segments of a brake orbit for a Kepler-type problem, establishing a strong analogy with the Schubart orbits of the gravitational $n$-body problem.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic absolutely continuous invariant measures for C^r one-dimensional maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For r &gt; 1, we show, using the Ledrappier-Young entropy characterization of SRB measures for non-invertible maps, that if a C^r map f of the interval or the circle has its Lyapunov exponent greater than 1/r log ||f ' || $\infty$ on a set E of positive Lebesgue measure, then it admits hyperbolic ergodic invariant measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We also show that the basins of these measures cover E Lebesgue-almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>Group-Convolutional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of symmetries into the Koopman-operator framework for the analysis and efficient learning of equivariant dynamical systems using a group-convolutional approach. Approximating the Koopman operator by finite-dimensional surrogates, e.g., via extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), is challenging for high-dimensional systems due to computational constraints. To tackle this problem with a particular focus on EDMD, we demonstrate -- under suitable equivarance assumptions on the system and the observables -- that the optimal EDMD matrix is equivariant. That is, its action on states can be described by group convolutions and the generalized Fourier transform. We show that this structural property has many advantages for equivariant systems, in particular, that it allows for data-efficient learning, fast predictions and fast eigenfunction approximations. We conduct numerical experiments on the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, a nonlinear and chaotic partial differential equation, providing evidence of the effectiveness of this approach, and highlighting its potential for broader applications in dynamical systems analysis.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of cognition based on oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which gives abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>
