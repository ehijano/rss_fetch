      <title>Distribution of codewords on the faces of a hypercube and new combinatorial identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for studying combinatorial identities through the geometric lens of subset distributions in q-valued cubes. By analyzing how elements of arbitrary subsets are distributed among the faces of the cube E_q^n, we discover new combinatorial identities with geometric significance. We prove that for any subset A contained in E_2^n, the rank function satisfies refined bounds that lead to exact computations for small cardinalities. Specifically, we show that for odd cardinalities, the lower bound is 4D_A/(|A|^2-1) where D_A is the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances in A. Our main theorem establishes identities connecting the number of k-dimensional faces containing exactly e elements of a subset to binomial sums over all subsets of specified cardinality. This yields a parametric family of identities where classical results emerge as special cases. As applications, we derive a geometric interpretation of Vandermonde's identity by examining faces of q-valued cubes, revealing that this classical result naturally arises from counting element distributions. We also obtain a completely new identity for even-weight vectors: (2^(k-1) - 1) times 2^(n-1) times binomial(n,k) equals the sum over i from 1 to floor(n/2) of binomial(n,2i) times binomial(n-2i,k-2i). This identity, valid for all 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n, demonstrates how geometric perspectives can uncover hidden combinatorial relationships. Our framework provides a unified approach for generating new identities and understanding existing ones through subset rank analysis.</description>

      <title>Perfect phylogenies via the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem: efficiently solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new efficiently solvable cases of the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem, an optimization problem with applications in cancer genomics introduced by Hujdurovi\'c, Husi\'c, Milani\v{c}, Rizzi, and Tomescu in 2018. The problem involves a family of finite sets, and the goal is to map each non-maximal set to exactly one set that contains it, minimizing the sum of uncovered elements across all sets in the family. Hujdurovi\'c et al. formulated the problem in terms of branchings of the digraph formed by the proper set inclusion relation on the input sets and studied the problem complexity based on properties of the corresponding partially ordered set, in particular, with respect to its height and width, defined respectively as the maximum cardinality of a chain and an antichain. They showed that the problem is APX-complete for instances of bounded height and that a constant-factor approximation algorithm exists for instances of bounded width, but left the exact complexity for bounded-width instances open. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We derive this result by examining the structural properties of optimal solutions and reducing the problem to computing maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and maximum weight antichains in partially ordered sets. We also introduce a new polynomially computable lower bound and identify another condition for polynomial-time solvability.</description>

      <title>Closed curve covering and multiagent TSP ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How efficiently can a closed curve of unit length in $\mathbb{R}^d$ be covered by $k$ closed curves so as to minimize the maximum length of the $k$ curves? We show that the maximum length is at most $2k^{-1} - \frac{1}{4} k^{-4}$ for all $k\geq 2$ and $d \geq 2$. As a byproduct, we show that $k$ agents can traverse a Euclidean TSP instance significantly faster than a single agent. We thereby sharpen recent planar results by Berendsohn, Kim, and Kozma (2025) and extend these improvements to all dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of computational methods for the online bin stretching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online bin stretching is an online packing problem where some of the best known lower and upper bounds were found through computational searches. The limiting factor in obtaining better bounds with such methods is the computational time allowed. However, there is still no theoretical guarantee that such methods do converge towards the optimal online performance. This paper shows that such methods do, in fact, converge; moreover, bounds on the gap to the optimal are also given. These results frame a theoretical foundation for the convergence of computational approaches for online problems.</description>

      <title>Computation of Immediate Neighbours of Monotone Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean networks constitute relevant mathematical models to study the behaviours of genetic and signalling networks. These networks define regulatory influences between molecular nodes, each being associated to a Boolean variable and a regulatory (local) function specifying its dynamical behaviour depending on its regulators. However, existing data is mostly insufficient to adequately parametrise a model, that is to uniquely define a regulatory function for each node. With the intend to support model parametrisation, this paper presents results on the set of Boolean functions compatible with a given regulatory structure, i.e. the partially ordered set of monotone non-degenerate Boolean functions. More precisely, we present original rules to obtain the direct neighbours of any function of this set. Besides a theoretical interest, presented results will enable the development of more efficient methods for Boolean network synthesis and revision, benefiting from the progressive exploration of the vicinity of regulatory functions.</description>

Abstract: In the graph shotgun assembly problem, we are given the balls of radius $r$ around each vertex of a graph and asked to reconstruct the graph. We study the shotgun assembly of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal G(n,p)$ for a wide range of values of $r$. We determine the threshold for reconstructibility for each $r\geq 3$, extending and improving substantially on results of Mossel and Ross for $r=3$. For $r=2$, we give upper and lower bounds that improve on results of Gaudio and Mossel by polynomial factors. We also give a sharpening of a result of Huang and Tikhomirov for $r=1$.</description>

      <title>Conformality of Minimal Transversals of Maximal Cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $H$, the dual hypergraph of $H$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $H$. A hypergraph is conformal if it is the family of maximal cliques of a graph. In a recent work, Boros, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Uno (Journal of Graph Theory, 2025) studied conformality of dual hypergraphs and proved several results related to this property, leading in particular to a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$. In this follow-up work, we provide a novel aspect to the study of graph clique transversals, by considering the dual conformality property from the perspective of graphs. More precisely, we study graphs for which the family of minimal transversals of maximal cliques is conformal. Such graphs are called clique dually conformal (CDC for short). It turns out that the class of CDC graphs is a rich generalization of the class of $P_4$-free graphs. As our main results, we completely characterize CDC graphs within the families of triangle-free graphs and split graphs. Both characterizations lead to polynomial-time recognition algorithms. Generalizing the fact that every $P_4$-free graph is CDC, we also show that the class of CDC graphs is closed under substitution, in the strong sense that substituting a graph $H$ for a vertex of a graph $G$ results in a CDC graph if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are CDC.</description>

Abstract: Dumitru Popa found asymptotic expansions for certain nonlinear recurrences, but left open the numerical evaluation of associated constants. We address this issue. A change of variables involving reciprocals and the algorithm of Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol play a key role in our computations.</description>

      <title>Treewidth Parameterized by Feedback Vertex Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first algorithm for computing an optimal tree decomposition for a given graph $G$ that runs in single exponential time in the feedback vertex number of $G$, that is, in time $2^{O(\text{fvn}(G))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\text{fvn}(G)$ is the feedback vertex number of $G$ and $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. On a classification level, this improves the previously known results by Chapelle et al. [Discrete Applied Mathematics '17] and Fomin et al. [Algorithmica '18], who independently showed that an optimal tree decomposition can be computed in single exponential time in the vertex cover number of $G$.
  One of the biggest open problems in the area of parameterized complexity is whether we can compute an optimal tree decomposition in single exponential time in the treewidth of the input graph. The currently best known algorithm by Korhonen and Lokshtanov [STOC '23] runs in $2^{O(\text{tw}(G)^2)}\cdot n^4$ time, where $\text{tw}(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. Our algorithm improves upon this result on graphs $G$ where $\text{fvn}(G)\in o(\text{tw}(G)^2)$. On a different note, since $\text{fvn}(G)$ is an upper bound on $\text{tw}(G)$, our algorithm can also be seen either as an important step towards a positive resolution of the above-mentioned open problem, or, if its answer is negative, then a mark of the tractability border of single exponential time algorithms for the computation of treewidth.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration in King Graphs by Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the enumeration of independent sets in king graphs of size $m \times n$, based on the tensor network contractions algorithm given in reference~\cite{tilEnum}. We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$.
  Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well.
  Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$.</description>
