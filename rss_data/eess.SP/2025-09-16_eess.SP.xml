      <title>Development of AI-integrated infrastructure with biomedical device and mobile app for neonatal vital monitoring during and in between kangaroo care sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premature infant mortality remains a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuous vital sign monitoring being essential for early detection of life-threatening conditions. This paper presents an integrated system combining NeoWarm, a novel biomedical device, with NeoRoo, a mobile application, and NeoSmartML, a machine learning infrastructure, to enable comprehensive vital sign monitoring during Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). Our power-optimized device achieves 6-6.5 days of continuous operation on a single charge, while the mobile application implements an offline-first architecture with efficient data synchronization. The optical character recognition pipeline demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 scores 0.78-0.875) for automated vital sign extraction from existing NICU monitors. Experimental validation shows the system's feasibility for deployment in resource-constrained settings, though further optimization of heart rate and temperature detection, along with the risk classification foundation model is needed.</description>

      <title>Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.</description>

      <title>FlowECG: Using Flow Matching to Create a More Efficient ECG Signal Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic electrocardiogram generation serves medical AI applications requiring privacy-preserving data sharing and training dataset augmentation. Current diffusion-based methods achieve high generation quality but require hundreds of neural network evaluations during sampling, creating computational bottlenecks for clinical deployment. We propose FlowECG, a flow matching approach that adapts the SSSD-ECG architecture by replacing the iterative diffusion process with continuous flow dynamics. Flow matching learns direct transport paths from noise to data distributions through ordinary differential equation solving. We evaluate our method on the PTB-XL dataset using Dynamic Time Warping, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and spectral similarity metrics. FlowECG matches SSSD-ECG performance at 200 neural function evaluations, outperforming the baseline on three metrics. The key finding shows that FlowECG maintains generation quality with substantially fewer sampling steps, achieving comparable results with 10-25 evaluations compared to 200 for diffusion methods. This efficiency improvement reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude while preserving physiologically realistic 12-lead ECG characteristics. The approach enables practical deployment in resource-limited clinical settings where real-time generation or large-scale synthetic data creation is needed.</description>

      <title>Uplink and Downlink Communications in Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems (SWANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed, in which a segmented waveguide composed of multiple short dielectric waveguide segments is employed to radiate or receive signals through the pinching antennas (PAs) deployed on each segment. Based on this architecture, three practical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN communications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure eliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA may re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a tractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA pinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional PASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement algorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Closed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are derived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of segments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces both the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby mitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These results are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are activated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the downlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best performance, followed by SA and then SS; and \romannumeral2) for all protocols, the proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single long waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Deterministic Modeling of Sub-THz Band Access Channels in Street Canyon Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies (100--300 GHz) are expected to play a key role in beyond-5G and 6G mobile networks. However, their quasi-optical propagation characteristics require new channel models beyond sub-100 GHz extrapolations. This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D) channel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment at 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed channel sounder. Based on these measurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies enables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath clusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics. A quasi-deterministic (QD) channel model is then proposed, combining deterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side walls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread, angular spread, and Rician K-factor) are also evaluated. These results provide valuable insights into sub-THz propagation in urban street canyons and contribute toward the development of accurate, channel models for future 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Atomic Norm Sparse/Diffuse Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the hybrid sparse/diffuse (HSD) channel model in frequency domain is proposed. Based on the structural analysis on the resolvable paths and diffuse scattering statistics in the channel, the Hybrid Atomic-Least-Squares (HALS) algorithm is designed to estimate sparse/diffuse components with a combined atomic and l2 regularization. A theoretical analysis is conducted on the Lagrangian dual problem and the conditions needed to be satisfied by primal and dual solutions are provided. This analysis, in turn, suggests an algorithm for optimal frequency support estimation. Debiased methods for improved channel estimation are provided. Given differing amounts of side information, performance bounds are derived in terms of a genie-aided estimator and constrained Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical results via simulations on synthetic data as well as real experimental data validate the efficacy of the proposed method. There are clear tradeoffs with respect to the properties of the channel with respect to performance: sparsity of specular paths and relative energy of diffuse components.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrating Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel self-calibrating integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (S-IF-TEM) that enables simultaneous parameter estimation and signal reconstruction during sampling, thereby effectively mitigating mismatch effects. The proposed framework is developed over a new practical IF-TEM (P-IF-TEM) setting, which extends classical models by incorporating device mismatches and imperfections that can otherwise lead to significant reconstruction errors. Unlike existing IF-TEM settings, P-IF-TEM accounts for scenarios where (i) system parameters are inaccurately known and may vary over time, (ii) the integrator discharge time after firings can vary, and (iii) the sampler may operate in its nonlinear region under large input dynamic ranges. For this practical model, we derive sampling rate bounds and reconstruction conditions that ensure perfect recovery. Analytical results establish the conditions for perfect reconstruction under self-calibration, and evaluation studies demonstrate substantial improvements - exceeding 59dB - highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments. These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance for solving the original BDPR problem.</description>

      <title>Online simplex-structured matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing (MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task. While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the computational cost.</description>

Abstract: We investigate graph signal reconstruction and sample selection for classification tasks. We present general theoretical characterisations of classification error applicable to multiple commonly used reconstruction methods, and compare that to the classical reconstruction error. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by using them to derive new optimal sampling methods for linearized graph convolutional networks, and show improvement over other graph signal processing based methods.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Self-Similar User Traffic Demand Using Transformers in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a transformer-based model to address the need for forecasting user traffic demand in the next generation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Considering a LEO satellite constellation, we present the need to forecast the demand for the satellites in-orbit to utilize dynamic beam-hopping in high granularity. We adopt a traffic dataset with second-order self-similar characteristics. Given this traffic dataset, the Fractional Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) model is considered a benchmark forecasting solution. However, the constrained on-board processing capabilities of LEO satellites, combined with the need to fit a new model for each input sequence due to the nature of FARIMA, motivate the investigation of alternative solutions. As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths. Concluding this paper, we provide extensive simulation results where the transformer-based solution achieved up to six percent better forecasting accuracy on certain traffic conditions using mean squared error as the performance indicator.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of a MATLAB-based GUI for Coarray Domain Analysis of Sparse Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a first-of-its-kind graphical user interface (GUI)-based simulator developed using MATLAB App designer for the comprehensive analysis of sparse linear arrays (SLAs) in the difference coarray (DCA) domain. Sparse sensor arrays have emerged as a critical solution in enhancing signal detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in fields such as wireless communication, radar, sonar, and integrated sensing systems. They offer several advantages over traditional uniform arrays, including reduced system complexity, lower deployment costs, and improved mitigation of mutual coupling effects. The tool enables users to input array configurations, compute DCAs, visualize weight function graphs, and assess the hole-free status of arrays, as applicable for coarray processing. Unlike conventional simulators that focus on radiation pattern visualization (array pattern, main lobe and sidelobe characteristics, azimuth cut, rectangular view, polar view etc.), this tool addresses the behavior of SLAs from a coarray domain perspective. Numerical validations demonstrate the tool's correctness, effectiveness, and its potential to foster further research in sparse arrays. This simulator could also be used as a teaching aid to drive home complicated topics and attract young minds towards the fascinating field of sparse array design.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal RIS-Aided Covert Channel Reciprocity Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology enhances wireless communication performance, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries. This paper investigates channel reciprocity attack (CRACK) threats in multi-antenna wireless systems operating in time-division duplexing mode using a physically consistent non-reciprocal RIS (NR-RIS) model. CRACK can degrade communication rate and facilitate passive eavesdropping behavior by distorting the downlink precoding, without requiring any additional signal transmission or channel state information (CSI). Unlike conventional RIS jamming strategies, the NR-RIS does not need synchronization with the legitimate system and thus can operate with slow or fixed configurations to implement CRACK, obscuring the distinction between the direct and RIS-induced channels and thereby complicating corresponding defensive precoding designs. To counter the CRACK threat posed by NR-RIS, we develop ``SecureCoder,'' a deep reinforcement learning-based framework that can mitigate CRACK and determine an improved downlink precoder matrix using the estimated uplink CSI and rate feedback from the users. Simulation results demonstrate the severe performance degradation caused by NR-RIS CRACK and validate the effectiveness of SecureCoder in improving both throughput and reducing security threats, thereby enhancing system robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revolutionizing communication architectures to achieve a balance between enhanced performance and improved efficiency is becoming increasingly critical for wireless communications as the era of ultra-large-scale arrays approaches. In traditional communication architectures, radio frequency (RF) signals are typically converted to baseband for subsequent processing through operations such as filtering, analog-to-digital conversion and down-conversion, all of which depend on expensive and power-intensive RF chains. The increased hardware complexity and escalated power consumption resulting from this dependency significantly limit the practical deployment of ultra-large-scale arrays. To address these limitations, we propose a holographic communication system based on the principle of interferometry, designated as holographic interference surfaces (HIS). Utilizing the interference effect of electromagnetic waves, HIS estimates the channel state information (CSI) by dealing solely with power information, which enables the replacement of RF chains with power sensors and completes the signal processing in radio frequency. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, we implemented a prototype system based on principles of holographic interference. Experimental results align well with theoretical predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the proposed HIS. This work provides a new paradigm for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Empowered Wireless Image Transmission over Complex Dynamic Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless image transmission underpins diverse networked intelligent services and becomes an increasingly critical issue. Existing works have shown that deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective framework to balance image transmission fidelity and data overhead. However, these studies oversimplify the communication system as a mere pipeline with noise, failing to account for the complex dynamics of wireless channels and concrete physical-layer transmission process. To address these limitations, we propose a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-empowered Dynamic Channel Adaptive Transmission (DCAT) scheme, designed for practical implementation in real communication scenarios. Building upon the Swin Transformer backbone, our DCAT scheme demonstrates robust adaptability to time-selective fading and channel aging effects by effectively utilizing the physical-layer transmission characteristics of wireless channels. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that DCAT consistently achieves superior performance compared with JSCC baseline approaches across all conditions. Furthermore, our neural network architecture demonstrates high scalability due to its interpretable design, offering substantial potential for cost-efficient deployment in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Resistor Hopping KLJN Noise Communication Using Small Bias Voltages Supported by ML and Optimum Threshold-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Resistor Hopping (RH) scheme with the addition of biases is proposed for secure Kirchhoff Law Johnson-Noise (KLJN) communication. The RH approach enables us to increase the bit rate of secure communication between Alice and Bob, while also ensuring that the inherent unconditional security of KLJN is satisfied. The biases are added to the proposed scheme to better distinguish between Gaussian distributed noises in terms of their means, rather than just using variances. Throughout the paper, we strive to minimize biases to achieve a power-efficient scheme. For the detection part of the proposed algorithm, a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector is derived. The separability condition of Gaussian distributions is investigated, along with the provision of a threshold-based detector that offers both simple and optimal thresholds in terms of minimizing the error probability. Some analysis of the proposed RH-KLJN communication scheme is provided, including Physical Layer Security (PLS) equations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme over the classical KLJN scheme, offering a higher data rate and lower bit error probability at the expense of increased complexity.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Quadratic Noise Modulation Using Non-Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter generalizes noise modulation by introducing two voltage biases and employing non-Gaussian noise distributions, such as Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) and Laplacian, in addition to traditional Gaussian noise. The proposed framework doubles the data rate by enabling discrimination in both the mean and variance of transmitted noise symbols. This novel modulation scheme is referred to as Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation (GQNM). Closed-form expressions for the Bit Error Probability (BEP) are derived for the Generalized Gaussian (GG) and Gaussian Mixture of Two Gaussians (GMoTG) cases. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the generalized modulation scheme, particularly under non-Gaussian noise assumptions, highlighting its potential for enhanced performance in low-power and secure communication systems.</description>

      <title>Solving ill-conditioned polynomial equations using score-based priors with application to multi-target detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering signals from low-order moments is a fundamental yet notoriously difficult task in inverse problems. This recovery process often reduces to solving ill-conditioned systems of polynomial equations. In this work, we propose a new framework that integrates score-based diffusion priors with moment-based estimators to regularize and solve these nonlinear inverse problems. This introduces a new role for generative models: stabilizing polynomial recovery from noisy statistical features. As a concrete application, we study the multi-target detection (MTD) model in the high-noise regime. We demonstrate two main results: (i) diffusion priors substantially improve recovery from third-order moments, and (ii) they make the super-resolution MTD problem, otherwise ill-posed, feasible. Numerical experiments on MNIST data confirm consistent gains in reconstruction accuracy across SNR levels. Our results suggest a promising new direction for combining generative priors with nonlinear polynomial inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for Sensing-Assisted Long-Term Beam Tracking in mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure-mounted sensors can capture rich environmental information to enhance communications and facilitate beamforming in millimeter-wave systems. This work presents an efficient sensing-assisted long-term beam tracking framework that selects optimal beams from a codebook for current and multiple future time slots. We first design a large attention-enhanced neural network (NN) to fully exploit past visual observations for beam tracking. A convolutional NN extracts compact image features, while gated recurrent units with attention capture the temporal dependencies within sequences. The large NN then acts as the teacher to guide the training of a lightweight student NN via knowledge distillation. The student requires shorter input sequences yet preserves long-term beam prediction ability. Numerical results demonstrate that the teacher achieves Top-5 accuracies exceeding 93% for current and six future time slots, approaching state-of-the-art performance with a 90% complexity reduction. The student closely matches the teacher's performance while cutting complexity by another 90%, despite operating with 60% shorter input sequences. This improvement significantly enhances data efficiency, reduces latency, and lowers power consumption in sensing and processing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Length FSK Waveforms for Joint Communications and Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration, ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density. Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Amplitude-Modulation to Frequency-Modulation Signal Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we wanted to discover an analog topology that could effectively convert amplitude-modulated (AM) signals to frequency-modulated (FM) signals, while also ensuring that both sets of signals were within their respective radio frequency (RF) bands. To that end, an effective topology for doing so was developed, characterized, and demonstrated, requiring the ability to de-modulate incoming signals from the AM radio band--spanning from 530 kHz to 1700 kHz--and re-modulate these signals into the FM radio band--spanning from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. These bands are separated by roughly 86 MHz, presenting the need for the topology to radically alter the incoming frequency before re-broadcasting. At its simplest implementation, this required an AM demodulation circuit coupled to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). Together, these two circuits translated variations in the incoming envelope signal to variations in the output frequency while still maintaining high-fidelity audio, similar to how existing radio receiving and broadcasting are done. Altogether, the project not only developed a working system but also provided valuable instruction in the design, analysis, and construction of effective RF circuits--invaluable to future endeavors within analog electronics.</description>

      <title>Cooperative UAV-mounted RISs-assisted Energy-efficient Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are promising technologies for 6G networks to support a great number of users. Compared with the fixed RISs, the properly deployed RISs may improve the communication performance with less communication energy consumption, thereby improving the energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider a cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted RISs (UAV-RISs)-assisted cellular network, where multiple RISs are carried and enhanced by UAVs to serve multiple ground users (GUs) simultaneously such that achieving the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and opportunistic deployment. Specifically, we formulate an energy-efficient communication problem based on multi-objective optimization framework (EEComm-MOF) to jointly consider the beamforming vector of base station (BS), the location deployment and the discrete phase shifts of UAV-RIS system so as to simultaneously maximize the minimum available rate over all GUs, maximize the total available rate of all GUs, and minimize the total energy consumption of the system, while the transmit power constraint of BS is considered. To comprehensively solve EEComm-MOF which is an NP-hard and non-convex problem with constraints, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II with a continuous solution processing mechanism, a discrete solution processing mechanism, and a complex solution processing mechanism (INSGA-II-CDC) is proposed. Simulations results demonstrate that the proposed INSGA-II-CDC can solve EEComm-MOF effectively and outperforms other benchmarks under different parameter settings. Moreover, the stability of INSGA-II-CDC and the effectiveness of the improved mechanisms are verified. Finally, the implementability analysis of the algorithm is given.</description>

      <title>Simplified Design Approach for Via Transitions up to 67 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic approach for high-speed via transition design is proposed. The effects of via barrel radius, anti-pad size, and the distance from adjacent stitching (GND) vias on bandwidth are analyzed and characterized. Guidelines for selecting parameter values are provided and validated by correlating 3D full-wave FEM simulation results with actual measurements of the coupon board. When a sufficient number of stitching vias are used, the via structure can be approximated as a coaxial transmission line. The proposed methodology builds on this approximation and also considers high-order modes. With this framework, engineers can easily optimize design parameters while intuitively understanding how geometry affects bandwidth. This approach also allows engineers with limited access to expensive and computationally intensive 3D FEM tools to design high bandwidth vias up to 67 GHz.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface for End-to-End OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) and dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) enabled wave-domain signal processing have emerged as promising research directions for offloading baseband digital processing tasks and efficiently simplifying transceiver design. However, existing architectures are limited to employing SIM (DPSIM) for a single communication function, such as precoding or combining. To further enhance the overall performance of SIM (DPSIM)-assisted systems and achieve end-to-end (E2E) joint optimization from the transmitted bitstream to the received bitstream, we propose an SIM (DPSIM)- assisted E2E orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where traditional communication tasks such as modulation, precoding, combining, and demodulation are performed simultaneously during electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation. Furthermore, inspired by the idea of abstracting real metasurfaces as hidden layers of a neural network, we propose the electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to enable the control of the E2E OFDM communication system. In addition, transfer learning is introduced into the model training, and a training and deployment framework for the EMNN is designed. Simulation results demonstrate that both SIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems and DPSIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems can achieve robust bitstream transmission under complex channel conditions. Our study highlights the application potential of EMNN and SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E OFDM systems in the design of next-generation transceivers.</description>

      <title>RadioLAM: A Large AI Model for Fine-Grained 3D Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radio map captures the spatial distribution of wireless channel parameters, such as the strength of the signal received, across a geographic area. The problem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves inferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an arbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples collected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the problem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces, particularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy. However, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the number of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of the radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial Intelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the creative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the ultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an augmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio samples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2) a generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the target 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations show that RadioLAM is able to solve the fine-grained 3D radio map estimation problem efficiently from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam training and prediction in millimeter-wave communications are highly challenging due to fast time-varying channels and sensitivity to blockages and mobility. In this context, infrastructure-mounted cameras can capture rich environmental information that can facilitate beam tracking design. In this work, we develop an efficient attention-enhanced machine learning model for long-term beam tracking built upon convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to predict both current and future beams from past observed images. The integrated temporal attention mechanism substantially improves its predictive performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves Top-5 beam prediction accuracies exceeding 90% across both current and six future time slots, significantly reducing overhead arising from sensing and processing for beam training. It further attains 97% of state-of-the-art performance with only 3% of the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Location Optimization Through Power Delay Profile Alignment Using Site-Specific Wireless Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulations require accurate transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) location information from real-world measurements to accurately characterize wireless propagation behavior in an environment. Such wireless propagation measurements typically employ GPS-based logging for TX/RX locations, which can produce meter-level errors that lead to unreliable RT calibration and validation. These location misalignments cause inaccurate interactions between RT-generated multipath components (MPCs) and the modeled 3D environment, which lead to erroneous channel predictions, and severe discrepancies between simulated and measured power delay profiles (PDPs) and channel characteristics. Moreover, the same RT-generated PDPs using inaccurate locations result in calibration errors when adjusting material properties such as conductivity and permittivity.
  This paper presents a systematic multi-stage TX/RX location calibration framework to correct location errors and consequently align measured and simulated omnidirectional PDPs.
  Optimization is performed using a computationally efficient multi-stage grid search and the Powell method. Applying the location calibration framework to NYU WIRELESS urban-microcell (UMi) measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz corrected TX/RX location errors of up to 7 m. The framework reduced the composite loss function by 42.3\% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5\% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Furthermore, peak power prediction accuracy improved by approximately 1 dB on average. Such improved geometric alignment enables accurate channel prediction, vital for beam management and infrastructure deployment for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Optimized Sparse Network Coverage via L1-norm Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of nodes that can serve as cluster heads, local sinks and gateways is a critical challenge in distributed sensor and communication networks. This paper presents a novel framework for identifying a minimal set of nexus nodes to ensure full network coverage while minimizing cost. By formulating the problem as a convex relaxation of the NP-hard set cover problem, we integrate the graph theoretic centrality measures of node degree and betweenness centrality into a cost function optimized via a relaxed L1-norm minimization. The proposed approach is applicable to static and dynamic network scenarios and does not require location or distance estimation. Through simulations across various graph models and dynamic conditions, it is shown that the method achieves faster execution times (lower complexity) and competitive sparsity compared to classical greedy and genetic algorithms (GA), offering a robust, distributed, and cost-efficient node selection solution.</description>

      <title>Meta Fluid Antenna: Architecture Design, Performance Analysis, Experimental Examination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense connectivity. These systems utilize dynamic radiating and/or shaping techniques to mitigate interference and improve spectral efficiency without relying on channel state information (CSI). The reported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated radiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To fully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose leveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency (RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation. This allows for a significantly larger set of independent radiating states without requiring additional signal processing. Simulations demonstrate that multi-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments compared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR can be optimized within a 15~$\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user Rayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for fast-changing wireless environments. Verified through the theoretical Jakes' model, full three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) simulations and experimental validation, multi-activation FAMA enables effective CSI-free, multi-user communication, offering a scalable solution for high-capacity wireless networks.</description>

      <title>RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens, this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under limited training data conditions.</description>

      <title>When marine radar target detection meets pretrained large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However, conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments, and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features, applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.</description>

      <title>Synergetic Empowerment: Wireless Communications Meets Embodied Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving into an agent era, where large-scale agents with inherent embodied intelligence are not just users but active participants. The perfect combination of wireless communication and embodied intelligence can achieve a synergetic empowerment and greatly facilitate the development of agent communication. An overview of this synergetic empowerment is presented, framing it as a co-evolutionary process that transforms wireless communication from a simple utility into the digital nervous system of a collective intelligence, while simultaneously elevating isolated agents into a unified superorganism with emergent capabilities far exceeding individual contributions. Moreover, we elaborate how embodied intelligence and wireless communication mutually benefit each other through the lens of the perception-cognition-execution (PCE) loop, revealing a fundamental duality where each PCE stage both challenges network capacity and creates unprecedented opportunities for system-wide optimization. Furthermore, critical open issues and future research directions are identified.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Joint Channel Acquisition and Communication Optimization in Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework in a movable antenna (MA)-enabled multiuser communication system. In contrast to the conventional works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), we address the practical CSI acquisition issue through the design of pilot signals and quantized CSI feedback, and further incorporate the joint optimization of channel estimation, MA placement, and precoding design. The proposed mechanism enables the system to learn an optimized transmission strategy from imperfect channel data, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that conduct channel estimation and antenna position optimization separately. To balance the performance and overhead, we further extend the proposed framework to optimize the antenna placement based on the statistical CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional benchmarks in terms of achievable sum-rate of users, especially under limited feedback and sparse channel environments. Notably, it achieves a performance comparable to the widely-adopted gradient-based methods with perfect CSI, while maintaining significantly lower CSI feedback overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of learning-based MA system design for future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>CAR-BRAINet: Sub-6GHz Aided Spatial Adaptive Beam Prediction with Multi Head Attention for Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) play a key role by stacking different communication technologies such as sub-6GHz, mm-wave and DSRC to meet diverse connectivity needs of 5G/B5G vehicular networks. HetVNet helps address the humongous user demands-but maintaining a steady connection in a highly mobile, real-world conditions remain a challenge. Though there has been ample of studies on beam prediction models a dedicated solution for HetVNets is sparsely explored. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a reliable beam prediction solution, specifically for HetVNets. This paper introduces a lightweight deep learning-based solution termed-"CAR-BRAINet" which consists of convolutional neural networks with a powerful multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. Existing literature on beam prediction is largely studied under a limited, idealised vehicular scenario, often overlooking the real-time complexities and intricacies of vehicular networks. Therefore, this study aims to mimic the complexities of a real-time driving scenario by incorporating key factors such as prominent MAC protocols-3GPP-C-V2X and IEEE 802.11BD, the effect of Doppler shifts under high velocity and varying distance and SNR levels into three high-quality dynamic datasets pertaining to urban, rural and highway vehicular networks. CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all the vehicular scenarios, demonstrating precise beam prediction with minimal beam overhead and a steady improvement of 17.9422% on the spectral efficiency over the existing methods. Thus, this study justifies the effectiveness of CAR-BRAINet in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying on the location angle and antenna dimensions of the mobile users, and thereby reducing the redundant sensor-latency.</description>

      <title>A Broadcast Channel Framework for MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be one of the major features of 6G wireless networks. In an ISAC system, communications and sensing functionalities are jointly performed using the same waveform, frequency band and hardware, thereby enabling various use cases such as in cyber physical systems, digital twin and smart cities. A major challenge to the design and analysis of ISAC is a unified framework that incorporates the two distinct functions. By viewing ISAC as a type of broadcast channel, in this paper, we propose a unified ISAC framework in which communication and sensing signals are broadcast to the actual communication users and virtual sensing users. This framework allows the application of existing multiplexing schemes, such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that have been intensively studied in data communications and information theory. Within this framework, we propose different superposition coding schemes, for cases when the sensing waveform is known or unknown to the communication receiver. We propose the waveform optimization algorithms in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setting accounting for the effects of clutter and Doppler shift. The proposed framework is numerically evaluated for different schemes under various sensing and communications performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</description>

      <title>The Microwave Rainbow: How Geometry Paints Colours in Microwave Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave vision from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides an all-weather, day-and-night capability to observe Earth, yet much of the information encoded in its signals remains undeciphered. Recent high-resolution imagery has revealed a striking phenomenon: man-made structures systematically appear in a spectrum of colours, the physical origin of which has been an open question. Here we show that this effect, which we term the microwave rainbow, is a form of geometric dispersion arising from structures acting as intrinsic diffraction gratings. We introduce a geometric-physical model that provides a direct analytical link between a target's geometry and its observed colour signature. This model quantitatively explains the full range of signatures, from continuous colour gradients on curved surfaces (zero-order diffraction) to repeating spectral patterns from periodic structures (high-order diffraction). This work transforms colour from a visual artefact into a precise measure of physical form, enabling the geometry of both critical infrastructure and natural phenomena to be mapped directly from space. Our findings establish the physical basis for a new remote sensing modality: microwave colour vision, and open a new frontier in how we perceive our world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.</description>

      <title>Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</description>

      <title>WAFER: A new method to retrieve sun-induced fluorescence based on spectral wavelet decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for photosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation health and gross primary productivity. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without introducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window.

      <title>RJD-BASE: Multi-Modal Spectral Clustering via Randomized Joint Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spectral clustering in multimodal settings, where each data modality is encoded as a graph Laplacian. While classical approaches--including joint diagonalization, spectral co-regularization, and multiview clustering--attempt to align embeddings across modalities, they often rely on costly iterative refinement and may fail to directly target the spectral subspace relevant for clustering. In this work, we introduce two key innovations. First, we bring the power of randomization to this setting by sampling random convex combinations of Laplacians as a simple and scalable alternative to explicit eigenspace alignment. Second, we propose a principled selection rule based on Bottom-$k$ Aggregated Spectral Energy (BASE)--a $k$-dimensional extension of the directional smoothness objective from recent minimax formulations--which we uniquely apply as a selection mechanism rather than an optimization target. The result is Randomized Joint Diagonalization with BASE Selection (RJD-BASE), a method that is easily implementable, computationally efficient, aligned with the clustering objective, and grounded in decades of progress in standard eigensolvers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that RJD-BASE reliably selects high-quality embeddings, outperforming classical multimodal clustering methods at low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Branched Broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) Infestation in Tomato Crops Using Leaf Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California, we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near 1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at 585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.</description>

      <title>BEM-Assisted Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems over Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) based on generalized complex exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) over doubly selective channels. The GCE-BEM is used to solve fractional Doppler dispersion.Then, the closed-form expression of channel estimation error is derived for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated channel, the MMSE detection is adopt to characterize the impacts of estimated channel on bit error rate (BER) by deriving the theoretical lower bound. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates severe inter-Doppler interference (IDoI). Our theoretical performance analysis can perfectly match the Monte-Carlo results, validating the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation based on GCE-BEM.</description>

      <title>Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.</description>

Abstract: We propose a low-complexity beamforming (BF) design for information leakage minimization in multi-user (MU) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. Our approach leverages fractional programming (FP) to reformulate the secrecy rate maximization problem into a tractable difference-of-convex form. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCP), enabling fast convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves secrecy rates comparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) methods, while significantly reducing computational complexity and improving convergence speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL) in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite. Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics. Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit, inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter (PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work addresses these challenges.
  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference smartphone across multiple frequency ranges. By aligning link- and system-level simulations with real-world device behavior, the new model enables more accurate evaluation of 6G technologies and supports consistent performance assessment across industry and research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that approximates the extreme eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of a symmetric matrix. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric matrices diagonalization to the case where we want to approximate just a few extreme eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The method is also particularly well-suited for the computation of sparse approximations of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show that in general, our method provides a trade-off between the sparsity of the computed approximate eigenspaces and their accuracy. We provide theoretical results that show the linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, we show experimental numerical results for sparse low-rank approximations of random symmetric matrices and show applications to graph Fourier transforms, and the sparse principal component analysis in image classification experiments. These applications are chosen because, in these cases, there is no need to perform the eigenvalue decomposition to high precision to achieve good numerical results.</description>

      <title>Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors Using Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding the activity of the nervous system is a critical challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we present a neuromuscular recording system that enables large-scale sampling of muscle activity using microelectrode arrays with over 100 channels embedded in forearm muscles. These arrays captured intramuscular high-density signals that were decoded into patterns of activation of spinal motoneurons. In two healthy participants, we recorded high-density intramuscular activity during single- and multi-digit contractions, revealing distinct motoneuron recruitment patterns specific to each task. Based on these patterns, we achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) for 12 single- and multi-digit tasks and over 96% accuracy for up to 16 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art EMG classification methods. This intramuscular high-density system and classification method represent an advancement in neural interfacing, with the potential to improve human-computer interaction and the control of assistive technologies, particularly for replacing or restoring impaired motor function.</description>

      <title>Securing Integrated Sensing and Communication Against a Mobile Adversary: A Stackelberg Game with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.</description>

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.</description>
