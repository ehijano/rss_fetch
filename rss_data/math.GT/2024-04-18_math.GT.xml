      <title>The rigidity of Doyle circle packings on the infinite hexagonal triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peter Doyle conjectured that locally univalent circle packings on the hexagonal lattice only consist of regular hexagonal packings and Doyle spirals, which is called the Doyle conjecture. In this paper, we prove a rigidity theorem for Doyle spirals in the class of infinite circle packings on the hexagonal lattice whose radii ratios of adjacent circles have a uniform bound. This gives a partial answer to the Doyle conjecture. Based on a new observation that the logarithmic of the radii ratio of adjacent circles is a weighted discrete harmonic function, we prove the result via the Liouville theorem of discrete harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Statistical convex-cocompactness for mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a finite volume deformation retract $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon_t}^{-}(\mathcal{N}_g)/\mathrm{MCG}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ of non-orientable surfaces $\mathcal{N}_g$ behaves like the convex core of $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{N}_g)$, despite not even being quasi-convex. We then show that geodesics in the convex core leave compact regions with exponentially low probabilities, showing that the action of $\mathrm{MCG}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ on $\mathcal{T}_{\varepsilon_t}^{-}(\mathcal{N}_g)$ is statistically convex-cocompact. Combined with results of Coulon and Yang, this shows that the growth rate of orbit points under the mapping class group action is purely exponential, pseudo-Anosov elements in mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces are exponentially generic, and the action of mapping class group on the limit set in the horofunction boundary is ergodic with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. A key step of our proof relies on complexity length, developed by Dowdall and Masur, which is an alternative notion of distance on Teichm\"uller space that accounts for geodesics that spend a considerable fraction of their time in the thin part.</description>

      <title>The boundary of bordified Outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary of the "Jewel space" $\mathcal J_n$ constructed in arXiv:1709.01296. This is an equivariant deformation retract of Outer space $CV_n$ on which $Out(F_n)$ acts properly and cocompactly, and is homeomorphic to the Bestvina-Feighn bordification of $CV_n$. In the current paper we analyze the structure of the boundary of $\mathcal J_n$. We then use the desctiption of the simplicial closure $CV_n^*$ as the sphere complex of a connected sum of $n$ copies of $S^1\times S^2$ to prove that this boundary is homotopy equivalent to the subcomplex of $CV_n^*$ spanned by vertices at infinity.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for Green metrics on hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the first author and Tanaka obtained a large deviation principle comparing two Green metrics on a non-elementary hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ associated to finitely supported, admissable probability measures. The aim of this article is to prove the corresponding central limit theorem. Furthermore, our results apply to various other metrics including length functions associated to Anosov representations and to group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces.
  In the particular case that $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic manifold our work provides a statistical characterisation for the hitting measure of a finitely supported random walk being in the same class as the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>A plat form presentation for surface-links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08634v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method, called a plat form, of describing a surface-link in the 4-space using a braided surface. We prove that every surface-link, which is not necessarily orientable, can be described in a plat form. The plat index is defined as a surface-link invariant, which is an analogy of the bridge index for a link in the 3-space. We classify surface-links with plat index $1$ and show some examples of surface-links in plat forms.</description>

      <title>New invariants for virtual knots via spanning surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define three different types of spanning surfaces for knots in thickened surfaces. We use these to introduce new Seifert matrices, Alexander-type polynomials, genera, and a signature invariant. One of these Alexander polynomials extends to virtual knots and can obstruct a virtual knot from being classical. Furthermore, it can distinguish a knot in a thickened surface from its mirror up to isotopy. We also propose several constructions of Heegaard Floer homology for knots in thickened surfaces, and give examples why they are not stabilization invariant. However, we can define Floer homology for virtual knots by taking a minimal genus representative. Finally, we use the Behrens-Golla $\delta$-invariant to obstruct a knot from being a stabilization of another.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Theory for Tubular Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of Morse function and establish Morse theory-like theorems over offsets of a compact set in a Euclidean space at regular values of their distance function. Our approach involves non-smooth analysis over Lipschitz functions. This paper adds to previous works that were able to extend Morse theory to several classes of subsets of Euclidean spaces such as submanifolds, Whitney-stratified sets and sets with positive reach. We prove that in our setting, the homotopy type of the sublevels sets of suitably-defined Morse functions changes around a critical value by gluing exactly one cell around each critical point of the same value.</description>

      <title>Non compact (2+1)-TQFTs from non-semisimple spherical categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contains three related groupings of results. First, we consider a new notion of an admissible skein module of a surface associated to an ideal in a (non-semisimple) pivotal category. Second, we introduce the notion of a chromatic category and associate to such a category a finite dimensional non-compact (2+1)-TQFT by assigning admissible skein modules to closed oriented surfaces and using Juh\'asz's presentation of cobordisms. The resulting TQFT extends to a genuine one if and only if the chromatic category is semisimple with nonzero dimension (recovering then the Turaev-Viro TQFT). The third grouping of results concerns sided chromatic maps in finite tensor categories. In particular, we prove that every spherical tensor category (in the sense of Etingof, Douglas et al.) is a chromatic category (and so can be used to define a non-compact (2+1)-TQFT).</description>
