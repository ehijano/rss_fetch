      <title>Modeling with quantities in calculus and physics: A conceptual framework of the fundamental theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a substantial curricular overlap between calculus and physics, yet introductory physics students often struggle to connect the two. We introduce a conceptual framework for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) to help unify learning across both disciplines. We propose a consistent approach to teaching definite integrals, including shared vocabulary and symbolism, to help students recognize how concepts like change, rate, and accumulation show up in both calculus and physics. We argue that the typical interpretation of the FTC in calculus, focusing on antiderivatives in closed form, doesn't align well with how physicists use these concepts. We advocate for an additional focus on Riemann sums and the underlying ideas of change, rate, products, and accumulation, which are fundamental in both fields. This approach can help students build a deeper, more integrated understanding of both mathematics and physics quantity. By aligning learning objectives across the disciplines, we argue that students can develop a stronger understanding of foundational mathematical principles.</description>

      <title>Teaching "Foundations of Mathematics" with the LEAN Theorem Prover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to observe if the theorem prover LEAN positively influences students' understanding of mathematical proving. To this end, we perform a pilot study concerning freshmen students at the University of Zurich (UZH). While doing so, we apply certain teaching methods and gather data from the volunteer students enrolled in the ``Foundations of Mathematics'' course. After eleven weeks of study covering some exercise questions implemented with LEAN, we measure LEAN students' performances in proving mathematical statements, compared to other students who are not engaged with LEAN. For this measurement, we interview five LEAN and four Non-LEAN students and we analyze the scores of all students in the final exam. Finally, we check significance by performing a $t$-test for independent samples and the Mann-Whitney $U$-test.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Definition and Systematization of Puzzle Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While logic puzzles have engaged individuals through problem-solving and critical thinking, the creation of new puzzle rules has largely relied on ad-hoc processes. Pencil puzzles, such as Slitherlink and Sudoku, represent a prominent subset of these games, celebrated for their intellectual challenges rooted in combinatorial logic and spatial reasoning. Despite extensive research into solving techniques and automated problem generation, a unified framework for systematic and scalable rule design has been lacking. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for defining and systematizing pencil puzzle rules. This framework formalizes grid elements, their positional relationships, and iterative composition operations, allowing for the incremental construction of structures that form the basis of puzzle rules. Furthermore, we establish a formal method to describe constraints and domains for each structure, ensuring solvability and coherence. Applying this framework, we successfully formalized the rules of well-known Nikoli puzzles, including Slitherlink and Sudoku, demonstrating the formal representation of a significant portion (approximately one-fourth) of existing puzzles. These results validate the potential of the framework to systematize and innovate puzzle rule design, establishing a pathway to automated rule generation. By providing a mathematical foundation for puzzle rule creation, this framework opens avenues for computers, potentially enhanced by AI, to design novel puzzle rules tailored to player preferences, expanding the scope of puzzle diversity. Beyond its direct application to pencil puzzles, this work illustrates how mathematical frameworks can bridge recreational mathematics and algorithmic design, offering tools for broader exploration in logic-based systems, with potential applications in educational game design, personalized learning, and computational creativity.</description>
