      <title>General Position Subset Selection in Line Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of points in the plane, the \textsc{General Position Subset Selection} problem is that of finding a maximum-size subset of points in general position, i.e., with no three points collinear. The problem is known to be ${\rm NP}$-complete and ${\rm APX}$-hard, and the best approximation ratio known is $\Omega\left({\rm OPT}^{-1/2}\right) =\Omega(n^{-1/2})$. Here we obtain better approximations in two specials cases:
  (I) A constant factor approximation for the case where the input set consists of lattice points and is \emph{dense}, which means that the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distance in $P$ is of the order of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.
  (II) An $\Omega\left((\log{n})^{-1/2}\right)$-approximation for the case where the input set is the set of vertices of a \emph{generic} $n$-line arrangement, i.e., one with $\Omega(n^2)$ vertices. The scenario in (I) is a special case of that in (II).
  Our approximations rely on probabilistic methods and results from incidence geometry.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of dichotomous ordinal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dichotomous ordinal graph consists of an undirected graph with a partition of the edges into short and long edges. A geometric realization of a dichotomous ordinal graph $G$ in a metric space $X$ is a drawing of $G$ in $X$ in which every long edge is strictly longer than every short edge. We call a graph $G$ pandichotomous in $X$ if $G$ admits a geometric realization in $X$ for every partition of its edge set into short and long edges. We exhibit a very close relationship between the degeneracy of a graph $G$ and its pandichotomic Euclidean or spherical dimension, that is, the smallest dimension $k$ such that $G$ is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ or the sphere $\mathbb{S}^k$, respectively. First, every $d$-degenerate graph is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and these bounds are tight for the sphere and for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and almost tight for $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\ge 3$. Second, every $n$-vertex graph that is pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^k$ has at most $\mu kn$ edges, for some absolute constant $\mu&lt;7.23$. This shows that the pandichotomic Euclidean dimension of any graph is linearly tied to its degeneracy and in the special cases $k\in \{1,2\}$ resolves open problems posed by Alam, Kobourov, Pupyrev, and Toeniskoetter. Further, we characterize which complete bipartite graphs are pandichotomous in $\mathbb{R}^2$: These are exactly the $K_{m,n}$ with $m\le 3$ or $m=4$ and $n\le 6$. For general bipartite graphs, we can guarantee realizations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ if the short or the long subgraph is constrained: namely if the short subgraph is outerplanar or a subgraph of a rectangular grid, or if the long subgraph forms a caterpillar.</description>

      <title>Approximate Hausdorff Distance for Multi-Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hausdorff distance is a fundamental measure for comparing sets of vectors, widely used in database theory and geometric algorithms. However, its exact computation is computationally expensive, often making it impractical for large-scale applications such as multi-vector databases. In this paper, we introduce an approximation framework that efficiently estimates the Hausdorff distance while maintaining rigorous error bounds. Our approach leverages approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search to construct a surrogate function that preserves essential geometric properties while significantly reducing computational complexity. We provide a formal analysis of approximation accuracy, deriving both worst-case and expected error bounds. Additionally, we establish theoretical guarantees on the stability of our method under transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling, and quantify the impact of non-uniform scaling on approximation quality. This work provides a principled foundation for integrating Hausdorff distance approximations into large-scale data retrieval and similarity search applications, ensuring both computational efficiency and theoretical correctness.</description>

      <title>Almost Optimal Locality Sensitive Orderings in Euclidean Space</title>

  For a parameter $\eps \in (0,1)$, we present a new construction of $\eps$-locality-sensitive orderings (&lt;LSOs) in $\Re^d$ of size $M = O(\Eps^{d-1} \log \Eps)$, where $\Eps = 1/\eps$. This improves over previous work by a factor of $\Eps$, and is optimal up to a factor of $\log \Eps$. Such a set of LSOs has the property that for any two points, $\p, \q \in [0,1]^d$, there exist an order in the set such that all the points between $\p$ and $\q$ in the order are $\eps$-close to either $\p$ or $\q$.
  The existence of such LSOs is a fundamental property of low dimensional Euclidean space, conceptually similar to the existence of well-separated pairs decomposition, so the question of how to compute (near) optimal construction of LSOs is quite natural.
  As a consequence we get a flotilla of improved dynamic geometric algorithms, such as maintaining bichromatic closest pair, and spanners, among others. In particular, for geometric dynamic spanners the new result matches (up to the aforementioned $\log \Eps$ factor) the lower bound, Thus offering a near-optimal simple dynamic data-structure for maintaining spanners under insertions and deletions.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Collision Detection via Vertex Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collision detection is a critical functionality for robotics. The degree to which objects collide cannot be represented as a continuously differentiable function for any shapes other than spheres. This paper proposes a framework for handling collision detection between polyhedral shapes. We frame the signed distance between two polyhedral bodies as the optimal value of a convex optimization, and consider constraining the signed distance in a bilevel optimization problem. To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our method exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a convex region related to the two bodies. Our method enumerates the values obtained at all extreme points of this region and lists them as constraints in the higher-level problem. We compare our formulation to existing methods in terms of reliability and speed when solved using the same mixed complementarity problem solver. We demonstrate that our approach more reliably solves difficult collision detection problems with multiple obstacles than other methods, and is faster than existing methods in some cases.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and Locomotion with Joint Movements in the Amoebot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are considering the geometric amoebot model where a set of $n$ amoebots is placed on the triangular grid. An amoebot is able to send information to its neighbors, and to move via expansions and contractions. Since amoebots and information can only travel node by node, most problems have a natural lower bound of $\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired by the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.
  In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus within $O(\log n)$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension open. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint movement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension, we consider two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: reconfiguration and locomotion.
  We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate reconfiguration algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we construct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling, and walking, respectively.</description>
