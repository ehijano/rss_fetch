      <title>The aerodynamic performance of a transonic airfoil with spanwise forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spanwise wall forcing in the form of streamwise-travelling waves is applied to the suction side of a transonic airfoil with a shock wave to reduce aerodynamic drag. The study, conducted using direct numerical simulations, extends earlier findings by Quadrio et al. (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 942, 2022, R2) and confirms that the wall manipulation shifts the shock wave on the suction side towards the trailing edge of the profile, thereby enhancing its aerodynamic efficiency. A parametric study over the parameters of wall forcing is carried out for the Mach number set at 0.7 and the Reynolds number at 300,000. Similarities and differences with the incompressible plane case are discussed; for the first time, we describe how the interaction between the shock wave and the boundary layer is influenced by flow control via spanwise forcing. With suitable combinations of control parameters, the shock is delayed, and results in a separated region whose length correlates well with friction reduction. The analysis of the transient process following the sudden application of control is used to link flow separation with the intensification of the shock wave.</description>

      <title>Capturing Extreme Events in Turbulence using an Extreme Variational Autoencoder (xVAE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flow fields are characterized by extreme events that are statistically intermittent and carry a significant amount of energy and physical importance. To emulate these flows, we introduce the extreme variational Autoencoder (xVAE), which embeds a max-infinitely divisible process with heavy-tailed distributions into a standard VAE framework, enabling accurate modeling of extreme events. xVAEs are neural network models that reduce system dimensionality by learning non-linear latent representations of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of xVAE in large-eddy simulation data of wildland fire plumes, where intense heat release and complex plume-atmosphere interactions generate extreme turbulence. Comparisons with the commonly used Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes show that xVAE is more robust in capturing extreme values and provides a powerful uncertainty quantification framework using variational Bayes. Additionally, xVAE enables analysis of the so-called copulas of fields to assess risks associated with rare events while rigorously accounting for uncertainty, such as simultaneous exceedances of high thresholds across multiple locations. The proposed approach provides a new direction for studying realistic turbulent flows, such as high-speed aerodynamics, space propulsion, and atmospheric and oceanic systems that are characterized by extreme events.</description>

      <title>Statistical Methods and Modal Decompositions for Gridded and Scattered Data: Meshless Statistics and Meshless Data Driven Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical tools are crucial for studying and modeling turbulent flows, where chaotic velocity fluctuations span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Advances in image velocimetry, especially in tracking-based methods, now allow for high-speed, high-density particle image processing, enabling the collection of detailed 3D flow fields. This lecture provides a set of tutorials on processing such datasets to extract essential quantities like averages, second-order moments (turbulent stresses) and coherent patterns using modal decompositions such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). After a brief review of the fundamentals of statistical and modal analysis, the lecture delves into the challenges of processing scattered data from tracking velocimetry, comparing it to traditional gridded-data approaches. It also covers research topics, including physics-based Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression for meshless computation of turbulent statistics and the definition of an RBF inner product, which enables meshless computation of data-driven decompositions. These include traditional methods like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), as well as advanced variants such as Spectral POD (SPOD) and Multiscale POD (mPOD). We refer to this approach as the "Meshless Data-Driven Decomposition" framework. We refer to this framework as "Meshless Data Driven Decomposition".

      <title>The Co-Moving Velocity and Projective Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a string of recent papers starting with (Transport in Porous Media, 125,
  565 (2018)), a theory of immiscible two-phase flow in porous media based on
  Euler homogeneity of the total volumetric flow rate has been investigated. The
  thermodynamic-like theory has an associated statistical mechanics based on a
  maximum entropy principle. A quantity called the co-moving velocity connects
  the equations of state of the intensive thermodynamic velocities and the
  physical seepage velocities of two flowing fluids. The obtained relations have
  a structure that can be interpreted using affine- and projective geometry. The
  co-moving velocity can be expressed as a transformation of the saturation
  using projective duality of points and lines. One obtains an exact
  constitutive relation depending on a projective invariant, the cross-ratio,
  which allows the co-moving velocity to be expressed in terms of a simple
  steady-state advection equation. A kinematic view of the
  velocity relations is presented, modeled by a well-known non-trivial geometry which turns
  out to be pseudo-Euclidean. The cross-ratio determines a hyperbolic angle in
  this space, and can be parametrized in terms of three numbers using a linear
  fractional transformation. Knowing these parameters, the pore velocity and
  the derivative of the pore velocity with respect to the saturation, an
  approximation for the co-moving velocity can be obtained for a range of applied
  pressures, viscosity ratios and surface tensions. The parametrization is
  demonstrated using data from a dynamic pore network model and
  relative permeability data from the literature. This paper only considers the
  pore areas as extensive variables, however, the geometric principles are
  general, and the same idea could potentially be used in other systems.</description>

      <title>A fully conservative discrete velocity Boltzmann solver with parallel adaptive mesh refinement for compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of the lattice Boltzmann method, discrete velocity Boltzmann models have provided a compelling alternative to classical Euler and Navier--Stokes--Fourier solvers in simulating fluid flows of various regimes by leveraging the kinetic theory of gases. Yet, significant challenges remain in efficiently and accurately simulating compressible high-speed flows while maintaining strict conservation of mass, momentum and energy. This paper presents a parallel and fully conservative adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of a finite-volume-based discrete kinetic model. The solver employs time-dependent H-type refinement combined with a two-population quasi-equilibrium Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook kinetic model. Results have shown that the targeted macroscopic moments as well as the dispersion and dissipation rates of all eigen-modes are accurately recovered while strictly preserving conservation laws. Furthermore, one- and two-dimensional benchmarks such as the Sod and Lax shock tubes, the Shu--Osher and several Riemann problems, as well as viscous shock-vortex interactions have demonstrated that the solver precisely captures reference solutions, whilst the AMR methodology efficiently reduces computational cost for the same accuracy and fidelity of the solution. The proposed solver marks an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible high-speed flows with moderate discontinuities, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiscale circulation in wall-parallel planes of turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall turbulence consists of various sizes of vortical structures that induce flow circulation around a wide range of closed Eulerian loops. Here we investigate the multiscale properties of circulation around such loops in statistically homogeneous planes parallel to the wall. Using a high-resolution direct numerical simulation database of turbulent channels at Reynolds numbers of $Re_\tau=180$, 550, 1000 and 5200, circulation statistics are obtained in planes at different wall-normal heights. Intermittency of circulation in the planes of the outer flow ($y^+ \gtrsim 0.1Re_\tau$) takes the form of universal bifractality as in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The bifractal character simplifies to space-filling character close to the wall, with scaling exponents that are linear in the moment order, and lower than those given by the Kolmogorov paradigm. The probability density functions of circulation are long-tailed in the outer bifractal region, {with evidence showing their invariance with respect to the loop aspect ratio}, while those in the inner region are closely Gaussian. The unifractality near the wall implies that the circulation there is not intermittent in character.</description>

      <title>Ensembles in Urban Large Eddy Simulations with Changing Wind Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences between time-averaged and ensemble-averaged wind are studied in this article for the case of changing wind direction. We consider a flow driven by a temporally turning pressure gradient in both an idealized case of a staggered cube array and a realistic urban environment. The repeating structure of the idealized case allows us to construct a large ensemble of 3 240 members with a reasonable compute time. The results indicate that the use of plain time average instead of an ensemble average allows for accurate calculation of only the along-wind mean velocity. Utilising Taylor diagrams, we show that a reasonable compromise between ensemble size and accuracy can be achieved utilising a 30-minute time average together with a 50-member ensemble for the flow within the urban roughness sublayer. During this 30-minute averaging period, the wind direction turns for approximately 4.8{\deg}. By applying this approach to the realistic urban geometry, we identify building wakes as the regions most severely affected by the incorrectly utilized time averaging.</description>

      <title>Assessment of averaged 1D models for column adsorption with 3D computational experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we formulate a 3D mathematical model describing the capture of a contaminant in an adsorption column. The novelty of our approach involves the description of mass transfer by adsorption via an evolution equation defined on the surface of the porous media, while Stokes flow and an advection-diffusion equation describe the contaminant transport through the interstices. Numerical simulations of the 3D model on different porous geometries, with the same porosity but different microstructure, have revealed a minimal impact of the microstructure on contaminant distribution within the column. Of particular interest is the little variation in the radial direction. Then, assuming a fine structure made of a periodic array of spheres and employing homogenization theory, we have rigorously derived an averaged 1D model of column adsorption. The model has the same mathematical form than the standard 1D column adsorption model, but contains a dispersion coefficient that explicitly incorporates microstructural details of the porous media. Consequently, our model offers a theoretical foundation for the widely used 1D model in the literature. Lastly, we compare the numerical solution of the 1D model with numerical simulations of the 3D model. The concentration profiles of the 1D model closely match the cross-section averaged concentration profiles of the 3D model. Likewise, the contaminant breakthrough curves at the outlet of both models are nearly indistinguishable. These results confirm the reliability of 1D models for investigating, optimizing, and aiding in the design of column adsorption processes for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Design of a Piezoelectric Wind Energy Harvester for Bacterial Disinfection of Drinking Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, a piezoelectric wind energy harvester is proposed for bacterial disinfection of drinking water. A mathematical model of a piezoelectric wind energy harvester is developed to predict the electrical energy from the wind induced vibration based on the galloping phenomenon. Structure of a piezoelectric wind energy harvester is a cantilever piezolaminated elastic beam with a bluff body attached to the free end. Linear time invariant and lumped parameter approach is considered to model the structure. In order to improve the performance of the harvester, bluff body is modified by attaching different attachment in the form of circular-shaped, triangular-shaped, square-shaped, Y-shaped, and curve-shaped. Bacterial disinfection of drinking water is performed using the electrical output of the piezoelectric wind energy harvester. Energy harvester with a curve-shaped attachment to a bluff body is used for this application because it provides enhanced electrical output as compared to other shaped harvesters. It has been found both numerically and experimentally that the harvester with a curve-shaped attachment to the bluff body provides the best electrical output.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.</description>

      <title>Mixture of neural operator experts for learning boundary conditions and model selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Fourier-based neural operators are best suited to learning mappings between functions on periodic domains, several works have introduced techniques for incorporating non trivial boundary conditions. However, all previously introduced methods have restrictions that limit their applicability. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to imposing boundary conditions inspired by volume penalization from numerical methods and Mixture of Experts (MoE) from machine learning. By introducing competing experts, the approach additionally allows for model selection. To demonstrate the method, we combine a spatially conditioned MoE with the Fourier based, Modal Operator Regression for Physics (MOR-Physics) neural operator and recover a nonlinear operator on a disk and quarter disk. Next, we extract a large eddy simulation (LES) model from direct numerical simulation of channel flow and show the domain decomposition provided by our approach. Finally, we train our LES model with Bayesian variational inference and obtain posterior predictive samples of flow far past the DNS simulation time horizon.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression of Data-Driven Reduced Order Model Closures for Under-Resolved, Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven closures correct the standard reduced order models (ROMs) to increase their accuracy in under-resolved, convection-dominated flows. There are two types of data-driven ROM closures in current use: (i) structural, with simple ansatzes (e.g., linear or quadratic); and (ii) machine learning-based, with neural network ansatzes. We propose a novel symbolic regression (SR) data-driven ROM closure strategy, which combines the advantages of current approaches and eliminates their drawbacks. As a result, the new data-driven SR closures yield ROMs that are interpretable, parsimonious, accurate, generalizable, and robust. To compare the data-driven SR-ROM closures with the structural and machine learning-based ROM closures, we consider the data-driven variational multiscale ROM framework and two under-resolved, convection-dominated test problems: the flow past a cylinder and the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 10000, 15000, and 20000. This numerical investigation shows that the new data-driven SR-ROM closures yield more accurate and robust ROMs than the structural and machine learning ROM closures.</description>

      <title>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

      <title>A meshless and binless approach to compute statistics in 3D Ensemble PTV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to obtain superresolution of turbulent statistics for three-dimensional ensemble particle tracking velocimetry (EPTV). The method is ''meshless'' because it does not require the definition of a grid for computing derivatives, and it is ''binless'' because it does not require the definition of bins to compute local statistics. The method combines the constrained radial basis function (RBF) formalism introduced Sperotto et al. (Meas Sci Technol, 33:094005, 2022) with a kernel estimate approach for the ensemble averaging of the RBF regressions. The computational cost for the RBF regression is alleviated using the partition of unity method (PUM). Three test cases are considered: (1) a 1D illustrative problem on a Gaussian process, (2) a 3D synthetic test case reproducing a 3D jet-like flow, and (3) an experimental dataset collected for an underwater jet flow at $\text{Re} = 6750$ using a four-camera 3D PTV system. For each test case, the method performances are compared to traditional binning approaches such as Gaussian weighting (Ag\"u\'i and Jim\'enez, JFM, 185:447-468, 1987), local polynomial fitting (Ag\"uera et al, Meas Sci Technol, 27:124011, 2016), as well as a binned version of the RBF statistics.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven dynamics of a ludion in a stratified fluid</title>

Abstract: Inspired by bouncing drop experiments that revealed how macroscopic systems can exhibit wave-particle properties akin to quantum systems, we explore here a new wave-particle system based on internal gravity waves propagating in a density-stratified fluid. Recent experiments on oscillating particles (called ludions) in a density-stratified fluid have shown that fluid-particle interactions lead to a symmetry breaking, resulting in the particle self-locomotion in the horizontal plane. Here, we show using 2D numerical simulations that this symmetry breaking is driven by a Doppler-effect force, which we also predict analytically using a minimal theoretical model. In wall-bounded domains, this Doppler force interacts with a Casimir-like potential rapidly developing due to wave reflection on the distant walls. Despite the Doppler force, this potential captures the ludion trajectories in fixed points or chaotic attractors located at or around the potential wells. We finally propose a minimal dynamical model recapitulating the main aspects of the ludion dynamics. Our work introduces the ludion as a new promising system for the exploration of macroscopic wave-particle duality.</description>

      <title>Response of liquid metal in a fusion reactor blanket to rapid variation of magnetic field during a transient plasma event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>

      <title>CaNS-Fizzy: A GPU-accelerated finite difference solver for turbulent two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CaNS-Fizzy -- Fizzy for short -- is a GPU-accelerated numerical solver for massively-parallel Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of incompressible two-phase flows. A DNS enables direct access to all flow quantities, resolved in time and space at all relevant continuum scales. The resulting numerical experiments provide complete data sets for the analysis of the detailed mechanisms underlying the flow, particularly the interaction between the chaotic and multi-scale dynamics of turbulence and the interface movement and deformation. The insights gained can guide the design and operation of various applications, such as boiling heat transfer, liquid-liquid extraction, gas-liquid reactors, absorption and stripping columns, distillation columns, liquid combustion appliances, in all of which the rate of heat and mass transfer between phases is proportional to the interfacial area. Fizzy's two-phase capabilities were implemented using the efficient, GPU-accelerated Navier-Stokes solver CaNS as base.</description>
