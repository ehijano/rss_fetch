      <title>Equilibrium measures for higher dimensional rotationally symmetric Riesz gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium measures for Riesz gases in dimension $d$ with pairwise interaction kernel $|x-y|^{-s}$, subject to radially symmetric external fields. We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $\alpha$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$.</description>

      <title>Resonant scattering for tunable quantum walks on graphs with tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the resonant scattering for discrete time quantum walks on graphs with some tails. In our arguments, we reduce the study of resonances to the perturbation of eigenvalues of a finite rank matrix associated with the internal graph. Then we can apply Kato's perturbation theory of matrices, and the reduction process of generalized eigenspaces allows us to derive an explicit asymptotic expansion of the scattering matrix. As a consequence, we obtain the resonant scattering at resonant energies.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach for generalized Cardano polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for generalized Cardano polynomials and show how their structure naturally leads to an operator formulation of Cardano method that is compatible with tools and concepts from quantum information theory. The generalized Cardano polynomials are constructed as a generalization of classical theory of Cardano formula for cubic equation, as well as through the spectral properties of the circular operator, that embeds Cardano type identities into their spectral theory. The construction clarifies the algebraic structure and solvability of a family of two parameters odd order polynomials, classically and through operator methods familiar in QIT, including Fourier transforms and spectral calculus on operator algebras. As applications, we show connections to Cebyshev polynomials and the solution of the quartic order Ferrari equation.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein's bound for wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a spatial region of width $2R$ and $\Phi$ a Klein-Gordon wave packet localized in $B$ at time zero. We show the inequality $S \leq 2\pi R E$; here, $S$ is the entropy of $\Phi$ contained in a region $B$, and $E$ is the energy content of $\Phi$ within $B$. We consider a wider setting and formulate a variational problem aimed at minimizing our bound when $\Phi$ is not localized in $B$. Our inequality holds in more generality in the framework of local, Poincar\'e covariant nets of standard subspaces and is related to the Bekenstein inequality. We point out a general bound that is compatible with the recent numerical computations by Bostelmann, Cadamuro, and Minz concerning the one-particle modular Hamiltonian of a scalar massive quantum Klein-Gordon field. We also provide a version of the entropy balance and ant formulas for wave packets.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization for lattice massive QED$_2$: the ultraviolet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a lattice regularization, preserving Ward Identities (WI) and with a Wilson term, of the Massive QED$_2$, describing a fermion with mass $m$ and charge $\mathsf{e}$ interacting with a vector field with mass $M$, in the regime $m\ll M\ll a^{-1}$ ($a$ being the lattice spacing) which is the suitable one to mimic a realistic 4d massive gauge theory like the Electroweak sector. The presence of the lattice and of the mass $m$ breaks any solvability property. In this paper we prove that the effective action obtained after the integration of the ultraviolet degrees of freedom is expressed by expansions which are convergent for values of the coupling $|\mathsf{e}|\le \mathsf{e}_0$, with $\mathsf{e}_0$ independent on $a$ and $m$, and with cut-off-independent bare parameters. By combining this result with the analysis of the infrared part in previous papers we get a complete construction of the model and a number of properties whose analogous are expected to hold in 4d. The analysis is done by integrating out the bosons and reducing to a fermionic theory; however, with respect to the case with momentum regularizations (which break essential features like the WI), the resulting effective fermionic action has not a simple form and this requires the developments of new methods to get the necessary bounds.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Non-Rotating Star Models: Classical Existence and Uniqueness Theory and Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the properties of non-rotating stellar models governed by the Euler-Poisson system under general equations of state, including the case of polytropic gaseous stars. We revisit and extend existence results by Auchmuty and Beals \cite{AB71}, adapt the uniqueness results from the quantum mechanical framework of Lieb and Yau \cite{LY87} to the classical Newtonian mechanical setting. The results are also synthesized in McCann \cite{McC06} but without proof. The second work we do is applying a scaling method to establish relations between solutions with different total masses. As the mass tends to zero, we analyze convergence properties of the density functions and identify precise rates for the contraction or extension of their supports.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Physics and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincar\'e group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program.</description>

      <title>Complexity and the Hilbert space dimension of 3D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in formulating a theory of quantum gravity is to determine the size and structure of the Hilbert space of black holes. Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity.</description>

      <title>Integration of Variational Quantum Algorithms into Atomistic Simulation Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the integration of Qiskit Nature's quantum chemistry solvers into the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), enabling hybrid quantum-classical workflows for force-driven atomistic simulations. This coupling allows the use of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its adaptive variant (ADAPT-VQE) not only for ground-state energy calculations, but also for geometry optimisation, vibrational frequency analysis, strain evaluation, and molecular dynamics, all managed through ASE's calculator interface. By applying ADAPT-VQE to multi-electron systems such as BeH2, we obtain vibrational and structural properties in close agreement with high-level classical CCSD calculations within the same minimal basis. These results demonstrate that adaptive variational quantum algorithms can deliver stable and chemically meaningful forces within an atomistic modelling workflow, enabling downstream applications such as molecular dynamics and active-learning accelerated simulations.</description>

      <title>Verlinde lines, anyon permutations and commutant pairs inside $E_{8,1}$ CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a defect-theoretic refinement of meromorphic 2d CFTs in which the ordinary torus partition function -- often just the vacuum character -- does not reveal how states organize under symmetry lines. Our central proposal is an \emph{equatorial projection} framework: from a commutant decomposition into commuting rational chiral algebras with categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}$, we encode genus-one couplings by a non-negative integer matrix $M$ pairing characters and satisfying modular intertwiner relations. Invertible topological defect lines act directly on this gluing data (Verlinde lines diagonally via $S$-matrix eigenvalues, and anyon-permuting lines by braided-autoequivalence permutations), making modular covariance of defect amplitudes automatic and sharply distinguishing insertions that yield genuine modular invariants from those defining consistent non-holomorphic interfaces. We further show that the \emph{replacement rules} of \cite{Hegde:2021sdm, Lin:2019hks} arise as equatorial projections of defect actions, and we extend these constructions beyond two-character examples by systematically treating three-character commutant pairs in the $E_{8,1}$ theory. The unique $c=8$ meromorphic CFT $E_{8,1}$ serves as a universal testbed, producing new defect partition functions and clarifying the roles of $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mathrm{Aut}^{\mathrm{br}}(\mathcal{C})$. Finally, we outline extensions to higher central charges (e.g.\ $c=32,40$), yielding modular-invariant non-meromorphic theories beyond the $c=24$ Schellekens landscape \cite{Schellekens:1992db} as defect/interface descendants of meromorphic parents.</description>

      <title>Existence for Stable Rotating Star-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and properties of stable, uniformly rotating star-planet systems, i.e. mass ratio is sufficiently small. It is modeled by the Euler-Poisson equations. Following the framework established by McCann for binary stars \cite{McC06}, we adopt a variational approach, and prove the existence of local energy minimizers with respect to the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ metric, under the assumed equation of state $P(\rho)=K\rho^\gamma$ and under the condition that the mass ratio $m$ is sufficiently small, corresponding to a star-planet system. Such minimizers correspond to solutions of the Euler-Poisson system. We consider two cases. For $\gamma &gt; 2$, we not only prove existence but also show, via scaling arguments, that the radii (to be precise, the bounds of the supports of the minimizers) tend to zero. For $\frac{3}{2} &lt; \gamma \leq 2$, we estimate an upper bound for the (potential) expansion rates of the radii, and it turns out that the existence result remains valid in this case as well. Finally, we provide estimates for the distances between different connected components of supports of minimizers and propose a conjecture regarding the number of connected components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Markovian growth process on a partially ordered set $\Lambda$, equivalent to last passage percolation (LPP) with independent (not necessarily identical) exponentially distributed weights on the elements of $\Lambda$. Such a process includes inhomogeneous exponential LPP on the Euclidean lattice $\mathbb{N}_0^d$. We give non-asymptotic bounds on the mean and variance, as well as higher, central, and exponential moments of the passage time $\tau_A$ to grow any set $A \subseteq \Lambda$ in terms of characteristics of $A$. We also give a limit shape theorem when $\Lambda$ is equipped with a monoid structure. Methods involve making use of the backward equation associated to the Markovian evolution and comparison inequalities with respect to the time-reversed generator.</description>

      <title>The Small Dispersion Limit of the Intermediate Long Wave Equation via Semiclassical Soliton Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03063v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_\varphi$ denote the weighted Bergman kernel associated to a plurisubharmonic function $\varphi$. We obtain upper bounds and positive lower bounds for the Bergman metric $i\partial \bar{\partial} \log K_\varphi$, expressed solely in terms of upper bounds and positive lower bounds of $i\partial \bar{\partial}\varphi$. Our approach applies in both local and compact K\"ahler settings. As an immediate application we obtain the optimal $C^{1,\alpha}$-convergence for the quantization of K\"ahler currents with bounded coefficients. We also show that any non-pluripolar Radon measure on a compact K\"ahler manifold admits a quantization.</description>

      <title>Impulse-induced liquid jets from bubbles with arbitrary contact angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the contact angle of a spherical bubble attached to a tube submerged in a container and the jet speed induced by an impulsive acceleration at its base. While it has been well established that bubble geometry strongly influences the ejection speeds of liquid jets, mathematical studies of liquid jets with arbitrary bubble shapes remain limited. In this work, we derive a pressure impulse in the small-cavity limit as a tractable integral of classical Legendre functions. It is shown that the jet speed can be divided into two components: (i) the velocity induced by the hydrostatic pressure impulse distribution created by the curvature of the bubble, and (ii) the velocity induced by the distribution of the submersion of the tube in a container. This decomposition reveals that an optimal bubble curvature emerges only when the tube is submerged: the optimality is absent for non-submerged configurations, where the jet speed increases monotonically with bubble depth. Experiments confirm this non-monotonicity and quantitatively support the predicted shift of the optimal geometry with submersion depth.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbations of an exact gravitational wave in the Bianchi IV universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proper-time method for constructing perturbative dynamical gravitational fields is presented. Using the proper-time method, a perturbative analytical model of gravitational waves against the backdrop of an exact wave solution of Einstein's equations in a Bianchi IV universe is constructed. To construct the perturbative analytical wave model a privileged wave coordinate system and a synchronous time function associated with the proper time of an observer freely moving in a gravitational wave were used. Reduction of the field equations, taking into account compatibility conditions, reduces the mathematical model of gravitational waves to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for functions of the wave variable. Analytical solutions for the components of the gravitational-wave metric have been found. The stability of the resulting perturbative solutions is proven. The stability of the exact solution for a gravitational wave in the anisotropic Bianchi IV universe is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Higher-Form Connections in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of higher-form connections on principal $\infty$-bundles in differential geometry. This is achieved by developing the formal differentiation and integration of maps from smooth manifolds to derived stacks with sufficient deformation theory. That allows us to introduce the Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid of a principal $\infty$-bundle and establish its global sections as the $L_\infty$-algebra of the derived higher symmetry group of the bundle. We define the space of $p$-form connections on an $\infty$-bundle as the space of order $p$ splittings of its Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid. We demonstrate that our new concept of derived geometric $p$-form connections recovers the known notion of connections on higher U(1)-bundles defined via \v{C}ech-Deligne differential cocycles. We further relate the $L_\infty$-algebras of derived higher symmetries of higher U(1)-bundles and higher Courant algebroids. Some applications in higher gauge theory and in supergravity are mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>

Abstract: For the system of cold plasma equations describing the motion of electrons in the field of stationary ions, we consider the Riemann problem posed at an impenetrable interface between two media. These media differ in the magnitude of the constant ion field. The interface between the media is assumed to be free. Its position is determined from the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and the stability condition, that is, the intersection of Lagrangian particle trajectories at the interface.</description>

      <title>Regularity of compact convex sets--classical and noncommutative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of regularity of embeddings of compact convex sets was developed in the 1970s, exclusively in the real case, and even there it does not appear to have been stated in its simplest form. We begin by revisiting this setting, showing that under a reasonable condition, every locally convex topological vector space $E$ that contains and is spanned by a compact convex set lying in a hyperplane not passing through the origin, is a (specific) dual Banach space equipped with the weak* topology. Second, we establish the corresponding regularity theory for convex sets in complex LCTVS's. Third, we develop a theory of regular embeddings for complex noncommutative convex sets, in the sense of Davidson and Kennedy. Finally, we use the complex theory to derive a theory of regular embeddings for real noncommutative convex sets. Interestingly, at present there appears to be no direct route to the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study for several compact strictly convex disjoint obstacles the length spectrum $\mathcal L$ formed by the lengths of all primitive periodic reflecting rays. We prove the existence of sequences $\{\ell_j\},\: \{m_j\}$ with $\ell_j \in \mathcal L,\: m_j \in \mathbb N$ such that the condition (LB) related to the dynamical zeta function $\eta_D(s)$ is satisfied. This condition implies the existence of lower bounds for the number of the scattering resonances for Dirichlet Laplacian. We construct such sequences under some separation condition for a small subset of $\mathcal L$ corresponding to lengths of the periodic rays with even reflexions. Our separation condition is weaker than the assumption of exponentially separated length spectrum $\mathcal L.$ Moreover, we show that the periodic orbits in the phase space are exponentially separated.</description>

      <title>Dirac Observables for Gowdy Cosmologies regular at the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gowdy cosmologies are exact, spatially inhomogeneous solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations which describe nonlinear gravitational waves coalescing at the Big Bang singularity. With toroidal spatial sections they provenly have the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property, in that close to the Big Bang dynamical spatial gradients fade out and the dynamics is governed by a Carroll-type gravity theory. Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian surface with Anosov geodesic flow. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for Pollicott--Ruelle resonances on random finite coverings of $M$ in the limit of large degree, which is expected to be optimal. The proof combines the recent strong convergence results of Magee, Puder and van Handel for permutation representations of surface groups with an analysis of the spherical mean operator on the universal cover of $M$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a functorial quantization of (co)Poisson Hopf algebras within a broad categorical framework. We further introduce categories naturally associated with (co)Poisson Hopf algebras, namely Drinfeld-Yetter modules. These categories provide a canonical setting in which we define explicit dequantization functors that are inverse to the quantization functors. Using this framework, we also establish functorial (de)quantization results for the corresponding module categories. Finally, we recover the classical results of Etingof and Kazhdan as special cases of our construction and discuss applications to deformation quantization \`a la Tamarkin.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Non-Gaussian Functional Integrals with Applications to Quantum Field Theory and Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:1501.01602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and develop a framework to understand functional integrals as countable families of Banach-valued Haar integrals on locally compact topological groups. The definition forgoes the goal of constructing a genuine measure on an infinite-dimensional space of functions, and instead provides for a topological realization of localization in the infinite-dimensional domain. This yields measurable subspaces that characterize meaningful functional integrals and a scheme that possesses significant potential for representing non-commutative Banach algebras suitable for mathematical physics applications. The framework includes, within a broader structure, other successful approaches that define functional integrals in restricted cases, and it suggests new and potentially useful functional integrals that go beyond the standard Gaussian case. In particular, functional integrals based on skew-Hermitian and K\"{a}hler quadratic forms are defined and developed. Also defined are gamma-type and Poisson-type functional integrals based on linear forms suggested by the gamma probability distribution. These non-Gaussian functional integrals are expected to play an important role in generating $C^\ast$-algebras of quantum systems. To illustrate and test the framework, examples and applications are presented in the contexts of quantum field theory and number theory.</description>

Abstract: Freed-Hopkins give a mathematical ansatz for classifying gapped invertible phases of matter with a spatial symmetry in terms of Borel-equivariant generalized homology. We propose a slight generalization of this ansatz to account for cases where the symmetry type mixes nontrivially with the spatial symmetry, such as crystalline phases with spin-1/2 fermions. From this ansatz, we prove as a theorem a "fermionic crystalline equivalence principle," as predicted in the physics literature. Using this and the Adams spectral sequence, we compute classifications of some classes of phases with a point group symmetry; in cases where these phases have been studied by other methods, our results agree with the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on calculating a specific class of Berndt integrals, which exclusively involves (hyperbolic) cosine functions. Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</description>

Abstract: The Boltzmann equation has been a driving force behind significant mathematical research over the years. Its challenging theoretical complexity, combined with a wide variety of current scientific and technological problems that require numerical simulations based on this model, justifies such interest. This work provides a brief overview of studies and advances on the solution of the linear Boltzmann equation in one- and two-dimensional spatial dimensions. In particular, relevant aspects of the discrete ordinates approximation of the model are highlighted for neutron and photon transport applications, including nuclear safeguards, nuclear reactor shielding problems, and optical tomography. In addition, a short discussion of rarefied gas dynamics problems, relevant, for instance, to the study of micro-electro-mechanical systems, and their connection with the Linearized Boltzmann Equation, is presented. A primary goal of the work is to establish as much as possible the connections between the different phenomena described by the model and the versatility of the analytical methodology, the ADO method, in providing concise and accurate solutions, which are fundamental for numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his seminal paper published in 2000 Kenyon developed a method to study the height function of the planar dimer model via discrete complex analysis tools. The core of this method is a set of identities representing height correlations through the inverse Kasteleyn operator. In a general setup, such as considered in [Chelkak, Laslier, Russkikh, 23, 22], scaling limits of these identities produce a set of correlation functions written in terms of a Dirac Green's kernel with unknown boundary conditions. It was proven in [Chelkak, Laslier, Russkikh, 23] that, in a simply connected domain, these correlation functions always coincide with correlation functions of the Gaussian free field given that they satisfy some natural a priori assumptions. This was generalized to doubly connected domains in the recent work [Chelkak, Deiman, 26], where correlations are shown to be the correlations of a sum of Gaussian free field and a discrete Gaussian component. We generalize this result further to arbitrary bordered Riemann surfaces.</description>

We establish the integrability of the model under three types of boundary conditions (periodic, twisted, and open boundaries), and present its exact solution, including the spectrum, eigenstates, and some observables. This integrable model can be generalized to the asymmetric case, decomposing into two asymmetric simple exclusion processes, and its exact solutions are also studied.</description>

      <title>Two invariant subalgebras of rational Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</description>

      <title>Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contain (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. Using contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed form by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of certain Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of $\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\pi^{-1}$ which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Additionally, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors are expressed as weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on the Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we study the collection of homological quasi-trees from a (delta-)matroidal perspective. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum error-correcting codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework, which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces Z-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA, a multi-agent research assistant platform where agents collaborate in a shared LaTeX-Python workspace synchronized with Git/Overleaf. Three specialized agents formulate constraints, sweep and screen candidate codes, exactify numerical solutions into rationals, and independently audit all KL equalities and induced logical actions. Focusing on distance-two codes with nondegenerate residues, we catalogue new nonadditive codes for dimensions $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ on up to six qubits, including high-order diagonal transversals, yielding $14,116$ new codes. From these data, the system abstracts closed-form families and constructs a residue-degenerate $((6,4,2))$ code implementing a transversal controlled-phase $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,i)$, illustrating how AI orchestration can drive rigorous, scalable code discovery.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</description>

      <title>The Askey--Wilson algebras, the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}_{3}$, and their fermionic realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive algebraic framework linking the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}_{3}$ to the Askey--Wilson algebras. First, we provide a manifestly symmetric reformulation of the algebra homomorphism from the universal Racah algebra $\Re$ to $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ by exploiting a Lie algebra isomorphism between $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ and $\mathfrak{so}_{3}$. This perspective facilitates a natural extension to the quantum setting, where we construct an explicit algebra homomorphism from the universal Askey--Wilson algebra $\triangle_{q^4}$ to the nonstandard quantum algebra $U_{q}^{\prime}(\mathfrak{so}_{3})$. By viewing the finite-dimensional irreducible $U_{q}^{\prime}(\mathfrak{so}_{3})$-modules of classical type as $\triangle_{q^4}$-modules, we demonstrate that the decomposition patterns perfectly parallel the branching rules of $U(\mathfrak{so}_3)$ over $\Re$. Furthermore, we extend this correspondence to the fermionic setting by establishing algebra isomorphisms between the skew group rings over $U(\mathfrak{so}_3)$ and $U_q'(\mathfrak{so}_3)$ and their associated anticommutator spin algebras. Collectively, these results provide a unified correspondence that bridges the gap between integrable algebraic structures, quantum groups, and their fermionic analogues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalise the self-referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set-theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as the least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and GR can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>

      <title>Unbounded banded matrices, shifted positive bidiagonal factorizations, and mixed-type multiple orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends Favard-type spectral representations for banded matrices $T$ beyond the bounded setting. It assumes that, for every $N\in\mathbb N_0$, there exists a shift $s_N\ge 0$ such that the shifted truncation $A_N:= T^{[N]}+s_N I_{N+1}$ admits a positive bidiagonal factorization (PBF). Allowing $s_N$ to depend on $N$ leads to a natural recentering step: the discrete Gauss-type quadrature measures associated with $A_N$ are translated by $x\mapsto x-s_N$, producing a uniformly bounded family of distribution functions. Combining moment stabilization for banded truncations with Helly-type compactness theorems yields a limiting matrix-valued measure, together with a Favard-type spectral representation and the corresponding mixed-type multiple biorthogonality relations. As a consequence, the classical Favard theorem for (possibly unbounded) Jacobi matrices is recovered as a special case. Indeed, for a tridiagonal $J$ with positive sub- and superdiagonals, each truncation $J^{[N]}$ admits a shift $s_N\ge 0$ such that $J^{[N]}+s_N I_{N+1}$ is oscillatory and therefore admits a PBF. The preceding construction then produces the usual spectral measure for $J$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>

      <title>Learning Heat-based Equations in Self-similar variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study solution learning for heat-based equations in self-similar variables (SSV). We develop an SSV training framework compatible with standard neural-operator training. We instantiate this framework on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, and perform controlled comparisons between models trained in physical coordinates and in the corresponding self-similar coordinates using two simple fully connected architectures (standard multilayer perceptrons and a factorized fully connected network). Across both systems and both architectures, SSV-trained networks consistently deliver substantially more accurate and stable extrapolation beyond the training window and better capture qualitative long-time trends. These results suggest that self-similar coordinates provide a mathematically motivated inductive bias for learning the long-time dynamics of heat-based equations.</description>
