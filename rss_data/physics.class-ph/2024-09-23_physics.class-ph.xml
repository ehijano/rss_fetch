      <title>The classical Doppler effect revisited by the mathematical description of the phase function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to shed some more light on one of the best known phenomena in the field of physics, the Doppler effect, in particular, on its classical version. Although, as mentioned, it is a phenomenon already described more than 150 years ago, the general case, even considering constant velocities, continues to be the subject of very recent bibliographical works which either show it incompletely or start from a not entirely accurate description of it. Here, general expressions of both frequency shift and aberration are obtained by geometrical description and, more interestingly, by describing the phase of the wave in the reference frame in which the propagating medium is at rest. The coherence between the two points of view permits to contrast the validity of the proposed results, and allows for a generalization of the resulting expressions for any reference frame, even those where the propagating medium is not still.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>
