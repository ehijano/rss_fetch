      <title>Exploiting Instabilities to Enable Large Shape Transformations in Dielectric Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric elastomers have significant potential for new technologies ranging from soft robots to biomedical devices, driven by their ability to display complex shape changes in response to electrical stimulus. However, an important shortcoming of current realizations is that large voltages are required for useful actuation strains. This work proposes, and demonstrates through theory and numerical simulations, a strategy to achieve large and controlled actuation by exploiting the electromechanical analog of the Treloar-Kearsley (TK) instability. The key idea is to use the fact that the TK instability is a symmetry-breaking bifurcation, which implies the existence of a symmetry-driven constant-energy region in the energy landscape. This provides for nonlinear soft modes with large deformations that can be accessed with very small external stimulus, which is achieved here by applying a small in-plane electric field. First, the bifurcation and post-bifurcation behavior of the electromechanical TK instability are established theoretically in the idealized setting of uniform deformation and electric field. Next, building on this, a finite element analysis of a realistic geometry with patterned top and bottom electrodes is applied to demonstrate large and soft shape changes driven by small voltage differences across the electrodes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of bulk properties of wet granular materials using different capillary force approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform Discrete Element Method simulations of wet granular matter in a split-bottom shear cell. To calculate the capillary forces from the liquid bridges between the grains, we used three different approximations. The simulations of the shear cell showed a linear increase in bulk cohesion with the surface tension of the liquid, consistently for all approximations. However, the macroscopic friction coefficient shows only a weak dependence on surface tension.</description>

      <title>A numerical toy model of Langevin dynamics provides real-time visualization of colloidal microdroplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed and tested a simplified but versatile numerical model of nanoparticles' aggregation using Langevin dynamics. The model is particularly capable of simulating aggregation in an evaporating (or condensing) microdroplet. It runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU), which makes it sufficiently fast for real-time conceptualization tasks. We have verified the results of modeling against the findings from two types of experiments we conducted in electrodynamic traps. Firstly, our model helped us to elucidate the phenomenon of scattering `revival', often observed during the evaporation of composite microdroplets. Further on, we were able to mimic our experiments, in which the microdroplets were dried up to form nanoparticle (NP) aggregates, and then soft-landed. Thus we could compare model predictions with SEM imaging. The model was tested for up to $2.5\times 10^5$ nanoparticles of several coexisting types. Several types of interactions can be accounted for: inter-particle: Lennard-Jones and Coulomb; external: dispersion medium viscosity, centrifugal force, gravity, surface tension, and interface movement. Brownian motion of nanoparticles can be freely controlled. The core program is accompanied by scripts extracting statistical NP aggregates properties in post-processing -- fractal dimension and radial distribution functions. The codes are made available in public repositories. Several diverse evolution scenarios are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to 4D print solvent-triggered, gradient-based bilayers made of semi-crystalline crosslinked polymer networks. Out-of-plane bending is obtained after immersion in the solvent, exploiting the different swelling degrees of the layers resulting from crosslinking gradients. Lastly, a beam model of the shape transformation is applied and experimentally validated.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological modeling of the stress-free two-way shape-memory effect in semi-crystalline networks: Formulation, numerical simulation, and experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers exhibiting the stress-free two-way shape-memory effect (SME) represent an appealing solution to achieve self-standing reversible actuation that is a fundamental feature required by numerous applications. The present paper proposes a one-dimensional continuum phenomenological framework to model single-component semi-crystalline polymer networks exhibiting both the one-way SME and the two-way SME under stress and stress-free conditions. A comprehensive experimental campaign is first performed on semi-crystalline networks based on poly($\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) to characterize the mechanical and thermal properties as well as the one-way and two-way shape memory behavior of the material under different thermo-mechanical conditions. The results guide the formulation of the model, elucidating the selection of the control and phase variables and motivating the choice of their evolution laws. Model capabilities are then demonstrated against experimental data. All the phenomena that influence the stress-free two-way SME, including the actuation temperature, heating/cooling rates, applied stress/strain, and the amount of skeleton and actuation phase, are analyzed and discussed, giving new important insight for application development.</description>

      <title>The importance of being discrete -- An agent-based model for active nematics and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems are composed of discrete units, assembled through a hierarchy of structures, and active, by locally extracting energy from their environment to produce mechanical work. Hydrodynamic theories have been successfully applied to describe the large scale dynamics of active materials. Yet, the hydrodynamic limit requires a separation of scales which is not necessarily fulfilled among living systems. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based model of flexible rods exchanging active force dipoles with nematic symmetry, allowing us to explore their behavior down to the sub-agent scale. We obtain spontaneous flows and self-propulsion of $+1/2$ topological defects, hallmarks of the hydrodynamic theory of active nematics, even on scales smaller than the individual agent! Moreover, our results go beyond the hydrodynamic framework, identifying novel correlations between orientation and flows or strong asymmetries between contractile and extensile activity. Finally, we show the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and nematic tissue growth. Because living systems like cell tissues often exhibit several sources of activity, our framework opens the way for more integrated descriptions of living materials.</description>

      <title>Bundling architecture in elastic filaments with applied twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of helical multifilament bundles and the torque required to achieve them as a function of applied twist. Hyperelastic filaments with circular cross sections are mounted parallel in a uniform circle onto end-clamps that can move along the twist axis depending on the applied axial load. With increasing twist, the filaments describe a hyperbolic hyperboloid surface before coming into contact in a circle, and then packing in a tight helical bundle in the center with increasing twist. While the bundle appears ordered for sufficiently small number of filaments, they are disordered for large enough number of filaments and applied twist. We reveal with x-ray tomography, that the packing of the filaments becomes disordered following a radial-instability which leads to a decrease in bundle radius, and migration of filaments relative to each other in the bundle. Nonetheless, the helical angle of the filaments in the bundle are found to be essentially constant, resulting in inclination angles which increase with distance from axis of rotation. We develop energy minimization analysis to capture the observed variations in bundle length and torque as a function of number of filaments considering the neo-Hookean nature of the filaments. We show that the bundle geometry and the applied load can be used to describe the non-linear torque profile measured as a function of twist angle.</description>

      <title>Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</description>

      <title>Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the "hit-and-stick" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $&lt; 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.</description>

      <title>Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excess free energy functional of classical density functional theory depends upon the type of fluid model, specifically on the choice of (pair) potential, is unknown in general, and is approximated reliably only in special cases. We present a machine learning scheme for training a neural network that acts as a generic metadensity functional for truncated but otherwise arbitrary pair potentials. Automatic differentiation and neural functional calculus then yield, for one-dimensional fluids, accurate predictions for inhomogeneous states and immediate access to the pair distribution function. The approach provides a means of addressing a fundamental problem in the physics of liquids, and for soft matter design: How best to invert structural data to obtain the pair potential?</description>

      <title>Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>
