      <title>Two-Step Iterative GMM Structure for Estimating Mixed Correlation Coefficient Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new method for calculating the mixed correlation coefficient (Pearson, polyserial and polychoric) matrix and its covariance matrix based on the GMM framework. We build moment equations for each coefficient and align them together, then solve the system with Two-Step IGMM algorithm. Theory and simulation show that this estimation has consistency and asymptotic normality, and its efficiency is asymptotically equivalent to MLE. Moreover, it is much faster and the model setting is more flexible (the equations for each coefficient are blocked designed, you can only include the coefficients of interest instead of the entire correlation matrix), which can be a better initial estimation for structural equation model.</description>

      <title>Improving prediction accuracy by choosing resampling distribution via cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a regression model, prediction is typically performed after model selection. The large variability in the model selection makes the prediction unstable. Thus, it is essential to reduce the variability in model selection and improve prediction accuracy. To achieve this goal, a parametric bootstrap smoothing can be applied. In this method, model selection is performed for each resampling from a parametric distribution, and these models are then averaged such that the distribution of the selected models is considered. Here, the prediction accuracy is highly dependent on the choice of a distribution for resampling. In particular, an experimental study shows that the choice of error variance significantly changes the distribution of the selected model and thus plays a key role in improving the prediction accuracy. We also observed that the true error variance does not always provide optimal prediction accuracy. Therefore, it would not always be appropriate to use unbiased estimators of the true parameters or standard estimators of the parameters for the resampling distribution. In this study, we propose employing cross validation to choose a suitable resampling distribution rather than unbiased estimators of parameters. Our proposed method was applied to electricity demand data. The results indicate that the proposed method provides a better prediction accuracy than the existing method.</description>

      <title>Massively Parallel Computation of Similarity Matrices from Piecewise Constant Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for piecewise constant functions (PCFs) and use this for several types of computations that are useful in statistics, e.g., averages, similarity matrices, and so on. We give a linear-time, allocation-free algorithm for working with pairs of PCFs at machine precision. From this, we derive algorithms for computing reductions of several PCFs. The algorithms have been implemented in a highly scalable fashion for parallel execution on CPU and, in some cases, (multi-)GPU, and are provided in a \proglang{Python} package. In addition, we provide support for multidimensional arrays of PCFs and vectorized operations on these. As a stress test, we have computed a distance matrix from 500,000 PCFs using 8 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Proposed modified computational model for the amoeba-inspired combinatorial optimization machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-celled amoeba can solve the traveling salesman problem through its shape-changing dynamics. In this paper, we examine roles of several elements in a previously proposed computational model of the solution-search process of amoeba and three modifications towards enhancing the solution-search preformance. We find that appropriate modifications can indeed significantly improve the quality of solutions. It is also found that a condition associated with the volume conservation can also be modified in contrast to the naive belief that it is indispensable for the solution-search ability of amoeba. A proposed modified model shows much better performance.</description>

      <title>multilevLCA: An R Package for Single-Level and Multilevel Latent Class Analysis with Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution presents a guide to the R package multilevLCA, which offers a complete and innovative set of technical tools for the latent class analysis of single-level and multilevel categorical data. We describe the available model specifications, mainly falling within the fixed-effect or random-effect approaches. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters, enhanced by a refined initialization strategy, is implemented either simultaneously, i.e., in one-step, or by means of the more advantageous two-step estimator. The package features i) semi-automatic model selection when a priori information on the number of classes is lacking, ii) predictors of class membership, and iii) output visualization tools for any of the available model specifications. All functionalities are illustrated by means of a real application on citizenship norms data, which are available in the package.</description>

      <title>A physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method for high-dimensional rare event simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method for efficient rare event simulation of civil and mechanical systems with high-dimensional input uncertainties. The method fuses interpretable low-fidelity physical models with data-driven error corrections. The hypothesis is that a well-designed and well-trained simplified physical model can preserve salient features of the original model, while data-fitting techniques can fill the remaining gaps between the surrogate and original model predictions. The coupled physics-data-driven surrogate model is adaptively trained using active learning, aiming to achieve a high correlation and small bias between the surrogate and original model responses in the critical parametric region of a rare event. A final importance sampling step is introduced to correct the surrogate model-based probability estimations. Static and dynamic problems with input uncertainties modeled by random field and stochastic process are studied to demonstrate the proposed method.</description>
