      <title>Refuting "Debunking the GAMLSS Myth: Simplicity Reigns in Pulmonary Function Diagnostics"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We read with interest the above article by Zavorsky (2025, Respiratory Medicine, doi:10.1016/j.rmed.2024.107836) concerning reference equations for pulmonary function testing. The author compares a Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), which is the standard adopted by the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI), with a segmented linear regression (SLR) model, for pulmonary function variables. The author presents an interesting comparison; however there are some fundamental issues with the approach. We welcome this opportunity for discussion of the issues that it raises. The author's contention is that (1) SLR provides "prediction accuracies on par with GAMLSS"; and (2) the GAMLSS model equations are "complicated and require supplementary spline tables", whereas the SLR is "more straightforward, parsimonious, and accessible to a broader audience". We respectfully disagree with both of these points.</description>

      <title>Access to healthcare for people with Alzheimer's Diseases and related dementias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) affects millions worldwide. Significant disparities exist in ADRD diagnosis and care, disproportionately impacting minority and socioeconomically vulnerable populations Objective: In this study, we investigate the relationship between ADRD density and accessibility to healthcare. We identify underserved and overserved areas in Maryland based on diagnosed cases and mortality due to ADRD, focusing on geographic disparities in care. Methods: 2023 Maryland ADRD patients were identified using ICD-10 codes from. Accessibility was measured using the Kernel Density Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) method. The Gini index and t-tests were used to analyze disparities between urban and rural areas. Hot Spot Analysis Getis-Ord Gi* and local bivariate relationships analysis were applied to assess spatial correlations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to calculate the health risk index. Results: Hospital accessibility was unevenly distributed. Mortality rates from ADRD were higher in underserved areas with fewer hospitals. Hot spot analysis shows eastern and southern Maryland have zones with high mortality per population and per ADRD patient, surrounded by similarly high-rate zones. Central Maryland shows lower death rates per patient but more hospital facilities. In eastern Maryland, higher poverty areas are surrounded by zones with lower accessibility and higher health risk indices. Conclusion: Hospital accessibility is unevenly distributed, creating major rural disparities. Underserved regions in terms of access to healthcare facilities, particularly in eastern and southern Maryland, exhibit high ADRD mortality rates despite low diagnosis rates. This suggests that many ADRD cases remain undiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or subject to delayed treatment.</description>

      <title>Group Cooperation Diverges onto Durable Low versus High Paths: Public Goods Experiments in 134 Honduran Villages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed large, lab-in-the-field experiment (2,591 participants across 134 Honduran villages; ten rounds) and tracked how contribution behavior unfolds in fixed, anonymous groups of size five. Contribution separates early into two durable paths, one low and one high, with rare convergence thereafter. High-path players can be identified with strong accuracy early on. Groups that begin with an early majority of above-norm contributors (about 60%) are very likely finish high. The empirical finding of a bifurcation, consistent with the theory, shows that early, high contributions by socially central people steer groups onto, and help keep them on, a high-cooperation path.</description>

      <title>Neural posterior inference with state-space models for calibrating ice sheet simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice sheet models are routinely used to quantify and project an ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise. In order for an ice sheet model to generate realistic projections, its parameters must first be calibrated using observational data; this is challenging due to the nonlinearity of the model equations, the high dimensionality of the underlying parameters, and limited data availability for validation. This study leverages the emerging field of neural posterior approximation for efficiently calibrating ice sheet model parameters and boundary conditions. We make use of a one-dimensional (flowline) Shallow-Shelf Approximation model in a state-space framework. A neural network is trained to infer the underlying parameters, namely the bedrock elevation and basal friction coefficient along the flowline, based on observations of ice velocity and ice surface elevation. Samples from the approximate posterior distribution of the parameters are then used within an ensemble Kalman filter to infer latent model states, namely the ice thickness along the flowline. We show through a simulation study that our approach yields more accurate estimates of the parameters and states than a state-augmented ensemble Kalman filter, which is the current state-of-the-art. We apply our approach to infer the bed elevation and basal friction along a flowline in Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Selection with an Application to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological parameter inference and model selection from a Bayesian perspective. Type Ia supernova data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR) are used to test the \(\Lambda\)CDM, \(w\)CDM, and CPL cosmological models. Posterior inference is performed via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) implemented in NumPyro and analyzed with ArviZ in Python. Bayesian model comparison is conducted through Bayes factors computed using the \texttt{bridgesampling} library in R. The results indicate that all three models demonstrate similar predictive performance, but \(w\)CDM shows stronger evidence relative to \(\Lambda\)CDM and CPL. We conclude that, under the assumptions and data used in this study, \(w\)CDM provides a better description of cosmological expansion.</description>

      <title>Network Meta Analysis of Mean Survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisions based upon pairwise comparisons of multiple treatments are naturally performed in terms of the mean survival of the selected study arms or functions thereof. However, synthesis of treatment comparisons is usually performed on surrogates of the mean survival, such as hazard ratios or restricted mean survival times. Thus, network meta-analysis techniques may suffer from the limitations of these approaches, such as incorrect proportional hazards assumption or short-term follow-up periods. We propose a Bayesian framework for the network meta-analysis of the main outcome informing the decision, the mean survival of a treatment. Its derivation involves extrapolation of the observed survival curves. We use methods for stable extrapolation that integrate long term evidence based upon mortality projections. Extrapolations are performed using flexible poly-hazard parametric models and M-spline-based methods. We assess the computational and statistical efficiency of different techniques using a simulation study and apply the developed methods to two real data sets. The proposed method is formulated within a decision theoretic framework for cost-effectiveness analyses, where the `best' treatment is to be selected and incorporating the associated cost information is straightforward.</description>

      <title>IntegralGP: Volumetric estimation of subterranean geochemical properties in mineral deposits by fusing assay data with different spatial supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an Integral Gaussian Process (IntegralGP) framework for volumetric estimation of subterranean properties in mineral deposits. It provides a unified representation for data with different spatial supports, which enables blasthole geochemical assays to be properly modelled as interval observations rather than points. This approach is shown to improve regression performance and boundary delineation. A core contribution is a description of the mathematical changes to the covariance expressions which allow these benefits to be realised. The gradient and anti-derivatives are obtained to facilitate learning of the kernel hyperparameters. Numerical stability issues are also discussed. To illustrate its application, an IntegralGP data fusion algorithm is described. The objective is to assimilate line-based blasthole assays and update a block model that provides long-range prediction of Fe concentration beneath the drilled bench. Heteroscedastic GP is used to fuse chemically compatible but spatially incongruous data with different resolutions and sample spacings. Domain knowledge embodied in the structure and empirical distribution of the block model must be generally preserved while local inaccuracies are corrected. Using validation measurements within the predicted bench, our experiments demonstrate an improvement in bench-below grade prediction performance. For material classification, IntegralGP fusion reduces the absolute error and model bias in categorical prediction, especially instances where waste blocks are mistakenly classified as high-grade.</description>

      <title>WTNN: Weibull-Tailored Neural Networks for survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weibull distribution is a commonly adopted choice for modeling the survival of systems subject to maintenance over time. When only proxy indicators and censored observations are available, it becomes necessary to express the distribution's parameters as functions of time-dependent covariates. Deep neural networks provide the flexibility needed to learn complex relationships between these covariates and operational lifetime, thereby extending the capabilities of traditional regression-based models. Motivated by the analysis of a fleet of military vehicles operating in highly variable and demanding environments, as well as by the limitations observed in existing methodologies, this paper introduces WTNN, a new neural network-based modeling framework specifically designed for Weibull survival studies. The proposed architecture is specifically designed to incorporate qualitative prior knowledge regarding the most influential covariates, in a manner consistent with the shape and structure of the Weibull distribution. Through numerical experiments, we show that this approach can be reliably trained on proxy and right-censored data, and is capable of producing robust and interpretable survival predictions that can improve existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Vaccine sieve analysis on deep sequencing data using competing risks Cox regression with failure type subject to misclassification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how vaccines perform against different pathogen genotypes is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies, particularly for highly genetically diverse pathogens like HIV. Sieve analysis is a statistical framework used to determine whether a vaccine selectively prevents acquisition of certain genotypes while allowing breakthrough of other genotypes that evade immune responses. Traditionally, these analyses are conducted with a single sequence available per individual acquiring the pathogen. However, modern sequencing technology can provide detailed characterization of intra-individual viral diversity by capturing up to hundreds of pathogen sequences per person. In this work, we introduce methodology that extends sieve analysis to account for intra-individual viral diversity. Our approach estimates vaccine efficacy against viral populations with varying true (unobservable) frequencies of vaccine-mismatched mutations. To account for differential resolution of information from differing sequence counts per person, we use competing risks Cox regression with modeled causes of failure and propose an empirical Bayes approach for the classification model. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach reduces bias, provides nominal confidence interval coverage, and improves statistical power compared to conventional methods. We apply our method to the HVTN 705 Imbokodo trial, which assessed the efficacy of a heterologous vaccine regimen in preventing HIV-1 acquisition.</description>

      <title>Innovation ARIMA models application to predict pressure variations in water supply networks with open-loop control. Case study in Noja (Cantabria, Spain)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water utilities are increasingly concerned about losses, leaks, and illegal connections in their distribution networks. Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control. This openloop control method lacks direct feedback between the PRV and CPC, making it challenging to distinguish whether pressure variations originate from normal head losses or abnormal network conditions. Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations. By accurately forecasting CPC pressure, this system enhances the detection of anomalous patterns, enabling more efficient network pressure management. The study demonstrates the potential of advanced modelling techniques in optimizing water distribution networks, providing valuable insights to improve system efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better fit real-world datasets, studying asymmetric distribution is of great interest. In this work, we derive several mathematical properties of a general class of asymmetric distributions with positive support which shows up as a unified framework for Extreme Value Theory asymptotic results. The new model generalizes some well-known distribution models such as Generalized Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, Fr\'echet, Half-normal, Modified half-normal, Rayleigh, and Erlang. To highlight the applicability of our results, the performance of the analytical models is evaluated through real-life dataset modeling.</description>

      <title>HPM-KD: Hierarchical Progressive Multi-Teacher Framework for Knowledge Distillation and Efficient Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for model compression but faces critical limitations: (1) sensitivity to hyperparameters requiring extensive manual tuning, (2) capacity gap when distilling from very large teachers to small students, (3) suboptimal coordination in multi-teacher scenarios, and (4) inefficient use of computational resources. We present \textbf{HPM-KD}, a framework that integrates six synergistic components: (i) Adaptive Configuration Manager via meta-learning that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) Progressive Distillation Chain with automatically determined intermediate models, (iii) Attention-Weighted Multi-Teacher Ensemble that learns dynamic per-sample weights, (iv) Meta-Learned Temperature Scheduler that adapts temperature throughout training, (v) Parallel Processing Pipeline with intelligent load balancing, and (vi) Shared Optimization Memory for cross-experiment reuse. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tabular datasets demonstrate that HPM-KD: achieves 10x-15x compression while maintaining 85% accuracy retention, eliminates the need for manual tuning, and reduces training time by 30-40% via parallelization. Ablation studies confirm independent contribution of each component (0.10-0.98 pp). HPM-KD is available as part of the open-source DeepBridge library.</description>

Abstract: We present predictive tools to calculate the number of ambulances needed according to demand of entrance calls and time of service. Our analysis discriminates between emergency and non-urgent calls. First, we consider the nonstationary regime where we apply previous results of first-passage time of one dimensional random walks. Then, we reconsider the stationary regime with a detailed discussion of the conditional probabilities and we discuss the key performance indicators.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Statistical Modeling in Action for Estimation and Forecasting in Low- and Middle-income Countries: The Case of the Family Planning Estimation Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) is used in low- and middle-income countries to produce estimates and short-term forecasts of family planning indicators, such as modern contraceptive use and unmet need for contraceptives. Estimates are obtained via a Bayesian statistical model that is fitted to country-specific data from surveys and service statistics data. The model has evolved over the last decade based on user inputs.
  In this paper we summarize the main features of the statistical model used in FPET and introduce recent updates related to capturing contraceptive transitions, fitting to survey data that may be error prone, and the use of service statistics data. We assess model performance through a validation exercise and find that FPET is reasonably well calibrated.
  We use our experience with FPET to briefly discuss lessons learned and open challenges related to the broader field of statistical modeling for monitoring of demographic and global health indicators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes have been proposed to personalize treatment decisions by utilizing historical patient data, but they may not always improve on the current standard of care. It is thus meaningful to integrate the standard of care into the evaluation of treatment strategies, and previous works have suggested doing so through the concept of clinical utility. Here we will focus on the comparative component of clinical utility as the average outcome had the full population received treatment based on the proposed dynamic treatment regime in comparison to the full population receiving the ``standard" treatment assignment mechanism, such as a physician's choice. Clinical trials to evaluate clinical utility are rarely conducted, and thus, previous works have proposed an emulated clinical trial framework using observational data. However, only one simple estimator was previously suggested, and the practical details of how one would conduct this emulated trial were not detailed. Here, we illuminate these details and propose several estimators of clinical utility based on estimators proposed in the dynamic treatment regime literature. We illustrate the considerations and the estimators in a real data example investigating treatment rules for rheumatoid arthritis, where we highlight that in addition to the standard of care, the current medical guidelines should also be compared to any estimated ``optimal'' decision rule.</description>

Abstract: Sequential monitoring of randomized trials traditionally relies on parametric assumptions or asymptotic approximations. We discuss a nonparametric sequential test and its application to continuous and time-to-event endpoints that derives validity solely from the randomization mechanism. Using a betting framework, these tests constructs a test martingale by sequentially wagering on treatment assignments given observed outcomes. Under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, the expected wealth cannot grow, guaranteeing anytime-valid Type I error control regardless of stopping rule. We prove validity and present simulation studies demonstrating calibration and power. These methods provide a conservative, assumption-free complement to model-based sequential analyses.</description>
