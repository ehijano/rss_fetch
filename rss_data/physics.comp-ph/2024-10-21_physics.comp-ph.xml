      <title>On the Robustness of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Thermodynamic Properties: a Case of Searching for New Quasicrystal Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals is a widely used and well-tried method of new materials design, the issues of its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not discussed enough. To highlight it, in this work we composed a series of nested intermetallic approximants of quasicrystals datasets and trained various machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective trick of sequential training to increase stability.</description>

      <title>Polygon-based unified Fourier-modal approach for diffractive optics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a theoretical formalism that unifies the rigorous coupled wave analysis and the dynamical diffraction theory. Based on this formalism, we design a computational approach for the diffraction calculation for the nanoscale lamellar gratings with an arbitrary line profile shape. In this approach, the gratings line profile is approximated as a polygon. This proves to be convenient since such an approach does not rely on the geometry model of the grating. We test the new approach against other computational theories and a synchrotron scattering experiment.</description>

      <title>A dual physics-informed neural network for topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dual physics-informed neural network for topology optimization (DPNN-TO), which merges physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the traditional SIMP-based topology optimization (TO) algorithm. This approach leverages two interlinked neural networks-a displacement network and an implicit density network-connected through an energy-minimization-based loss function derived from the variational principles of the governing equations. By embedding deep learning within the physical constraints of the problem, DPNN-TO eliminates the need for large-scale data and analytical sensitivity analysis, addressing key limitations of traditional methods. The framework efficiently minimizes compliance through energy-based objectives while enforcing volume fraction constraints, producing high-resolution designs for both 2D and 3D optimization problems. Extensive numerical validation demonstrates that DPNN-TO outperforms conventional methods, solving complex structural optimization scenarios with greater flexibility and computational efficiency, while addressing challenges such as multiple load cases and three-dimensional problems without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modeling of shock wave passage through porous copper using moving window technique and kernel gradient correction in smoothed particle hydrodynamics method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for modeling stationary shock waves in porous materials, which employs the recently developed moving window technique. The core of this method is the iterative adjustment of the reference frame to the boundary conditions that regulate the entry and exit of Lagrangian particles from a fixed computational domain, which are used to model the flow of a compressible medium. A Godunov-type smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method with reconstruction of values at the contact is employed for the purposes of modeling. Kernel gradient correction for this method is proposed to enhance the precision of the approximation. The shock Hugoniot of porous copper is calculated, and the structure of the compacting wave and elastic precursor in porous copper at shock amplitude near the yield strength of solid copper is studied.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient queue-based algorithm for simulating volume-controlled drainage under the influence of gravity on volumetric images of porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02895v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating non-wetting fluid invasion in volumetric images of porous materials is of broad interest in applications as diverse as electrochemical devices and CO2 sequestration. Among available methods, image-based algorithms offer much lower computational cost compared to direct numerical simulations. Recent work has extended image-based method to incorporate more physics such as gravity and volume-controlled invasion. The present work combines these two developments to develop an image-based invasion percolation algorithm that incorporates the effect of gravity. Additionally, the presented algorithm was developed using a priority queue algorithm to drastically reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The priority queue-based method was validated against previous image-based methods both with and without the effect of gravity, showing identical results. It was also shown that the new method provides a speedup of 20X over the previous image-based methods. Finally, comparison with experimental results at three Bond numbers showed that the model can predict the real invasion process with a high accuracy with and without gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>The State of Factoring on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the current state of factoring integers on both digital and analog quantum computers. For digital quantum computers, we study the effect of errors for which one can formally prove that Shor's factoring algorithm fails. For analog quantum computers, we experimentally test three factorisation methods and provide evidence for a scaling performance that is absolutely and asymptotically better than random guessing but still exponential. We conclude with an overview of future perspectives on factoring large integers on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of Parallax Effects in Thick Silicon Sensors in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the "effective" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones. We present the preliminary results of our study on the influence of the PSF on SNR, image contrast, position resolution, and achievable sample resolution for different pixel sizes.</description>

      <title>Responding to objections made by Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} concerning kinetic molecular theory: an illustration of how to teach physics students to evaluate pseudoscientific work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} has argued that kinetic molecular theory does not correctly describe thermal equilibrium in ideal gases and has provided some examples that purportedly show that the standard laws imply consequences that contradict experimental results. This paper considers a few of the examples in detail and concludes that Co\c{s}ofre\c{t}'s analysis is erroneous. Furthermore, although it does not disprove any of the other claims made by Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} in criticising thermodynamics and many other fields of physics, it does call his whole project into question, as Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} exhibits a lack of relevant training, limited knowledge of key facts and previous research, and a disposition to favour his own intuitions above theoretical and experimental checks. The exercise below illustrates some of the problems commonly encountered in pseudoscientific approaches, and provides a few tips on how to teach aspiring scientists about how to evaluate such works for themselves.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameter optimization analysis of dynamical quantum critical phenomena in long-range transverse-field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading-order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully obtained numerical evidence supporting $\sigma = 7/4$ as the universality boundary between the latter two.</description>

      <title>Quantum embedding study of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NV$^{-}$ color center in diamond has been demonstrated as a powerful nanosensor for quantum metrology due to the sensitivity of its optical and spin properties to external electric, magnetic, and strain fields. In view of these applications, we use quantum embedding to derive a many-body description of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center. We quantify how strain longitudinal to the axis of NV$^{-}$ shifts the excited states in energy, while strain with a component transverse to the NV$^{-}$ axis splits the degeneracies of the $^{3}E$ and $^{1}E$ states. The largest effects are for the optically relevant $^{3}E$ manifold, which splits into $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ with transverse strain. From these responses we extract strain susceptibilities for the $E_{x/y}$ states within the quasi-linear regime. Additionally, we study the many-body dipole matrix elements of the NV$^{-}$ and find a permanent dipole 1.64 D at zero strain, which is somewhat smaller than that obtained from recent density functional theory calculations. We also determine the transition dipole between the $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ and how it evolves with strain.</description>
