      <title>Review and Prospect of Algebraic Research in Equivalent Framework between Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical equivalence between statistical mechanics and machine learning theory has been known since the 20th century, and researches based on such equivalence has provided novel methodology in both theoretical physics and statistical learning theory. For example, algebraic approach in statistical mechanics such as operator algebra enables us to analyze phase transition phenomena mathematically. In this paper, for theoretical physicists who are interested in artificial intelligence, we review and prospect algebraic researches in machine learning theory. If a learning machine has hierarchical structure or latent variables, then the random Hamiltonian cannot be expressed by any quadratic perturbation because it has singularities. To study an equilibrium state defined by such a singular random Hamiltonian, algebraic approach is necessary to derive asymptotic form of the free energy and the generalization error. We also introduce the most recent advance, in fact,theoretical foundation for alignment of artificial intelligence is now being constructed based on algebraic learning theory. This paper is devoted to the memory of Professor Huzihiro Araki who is a pioneer founder of algebraic research in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Flow of Energy and Information in Molecular Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular machines transduce free energy between different forms throughout all living organisms. While truly machines in their own right, unlike their macroscopic counterparts molecular machines are characterized by stochastic fluctuations, overdamped dynamics, and soft components, and operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, information is a relevant free-energy resource for molecular machines, leading to new modes of operation for nanoscale engines. Towards the objective of engineering synthetic nanomachines, an important goal is to understand how molecular machines transduce free energy to perform their functions in biological systems. In this review we discuss the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of free-energy transduction within molecular machines, with a focus on quantifying energy and information flows between their components. We review results from theory, modeling, and inference from experiments that shed light on the internal thermodynamics of molecular machines, and ultimately explore what we can learn from considering these interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of generalized triple Ising chains with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the exact physical characteristics of the triple-chain Ising model on a torus with all possible multispin interactions invariant with respect to rotation by the angle $2\pi / 3$. The exact value of the partition function in a finite cyclically closed strip of length $L$, as well as the free energy, internal energy, specific heat, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in the thermodynamic limit at $L \to \infty$ are found by the transfer-matrix method for the model. The spectrum of the transfer-matrix and the structure of its eigenvectors are found. For two special cases - for the model with multispin interactions of even number of spins and for the model with some interactions of two, three, four and six spins, simplified expressions of the mentioned physical characteristics are obtained; in the thermodynamic limit they are expressed through the logarithm of the root of the quadratic equation. For the model with multispin interactions of an even number of spins, a kind of pair correlations in the thermodynamic limit is found, and it is shown that the magnetization at zero magnetic field is equal to zero; the structure of the ground states of the system is found and examples of their projections of seven-dimensional space onto three-dimensional space and examples of configurations corresponding to these ground states are given. The correlation length is shown and its graphs are given. As special cases, we consider the planar triangular model with all possible interactions, including, perhaps, different triple interactions inside neighboring triangles, and the planar model with nearest-neighbor, next nearest-neighbor, and plaquette interactions. For them the main exact physical characteristics have been found. This allowed us to obtain them for the planar gonihedric model as well.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that most of the existing versions of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model $-$ those whose coefficient are independent of the molecular velocity $-$ do not satisfy the Onsager relations. This casts doubt on their qualitative relevance and definitely rules them out as a quantitative predictive tool.</description>

      <title>Coarsening and metastability of the long-range voter model in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically the ordering kinetics and the final metastable states in the three-dimensional long-range voter model where $N$ agents described by a boolean spin variable $S_i$ can be found in two states (or opinion) $\pm 1$. The kinetics is such that each agent copies the opinion of another at distance $r$ chosen with probability $P(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ ($\al &gt;0$). In the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ the system approaches a correlated metastable state without consensus, namely without full spin alignment. In such states the equal-time correlation function $C(r)=\langle S_iS_j\rangle$ (where r is the $i-j$ distance) decrease algebraically in a slow, non-integrable way. Specifically, we find $C(r)\sim r^{-1}$, or $C(r)\sim r^{-(6-\al)}$, or $C(r)\sim r^{-\al}$ for $\al &gt;5$, $3&lt;\al \le 5$ and $0\le \al \le 3$, respectively. In a finite system metastability is escaped after a time of order $N$ and full ordering is eventually achieved. The dynamics leading to metastability is of the coarsening type, with an ever increasing correlation length $L(t)$ (for $N\to \infty$). We find $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for $\al &gt;5$, $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{5}{2\al}}$ for $4&lt;\al \le 5$, and $L(t)\sim t^{\frac{5}{8}}$ for $3\le \al \le 4$. For $0\le \al &lt; 3$ there is not macroscopic coarsening because stationarity is reached in a microscopic time. Such results allow us to conjecture the behavior of the model for generic space dimension.</description>

      <title>Algebraic depletion interactions in two-temperature mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase separation that occurs in two-temperature mixtures, which are driven out of equilibrium at the local scale, has been thoroughly characterized, but much less is known about the depletion interactions that drive it Using numerical simulations in dimension 2, we show that the depletion interactions extend beyond two particle diameters in dilute systems, as expected at equilibrium, and decay algebraically with an exponent $-4$. Solving for the $N$-particle distribution function in the stationary state, perturbatively in the interaction potential, we show that the algebraic correlations arise from triplets of particles at different temperatures, and recover the exponent $-4$.</description>

      <title>An approach to non-equilibrium statistical physics using variational Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Superstatistics as the thermodynamic limit of driven classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstatistics is an elegant framework for the description of steady-state thermodynamics, mostly used for systems with long-range interactions such as plasmas. In this work, we show that the potential energy distribution of a classical system under externally imposed energy fluctuations can also be described by superstatistics in the thermodynamic limit. As an example, we apply this formalism to the thermodynamics of a finite Lennard-Jones crystal with constant microcanonical heat capacity driven by sinusoidal energy oscillations. Our results show that molecular dynamics simulations of the Lennard-Jones crystal are in agreement with the provided theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Site-percolation transition of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study percolation transition of run and tumble particles (RTPs) on a two dimensional square lattice. RTPs in these models run to the nearest neighbour along their internal orientation with unit rate, and to other nearest neighbours with rates $p$. In addition, they tumble to change their internal orientation with rate $\omega$. We show that for small tumble rates, RTP-clusters created by joining occupied nearest neighbours irrespective of their orientation form a phase separated state when the rate of positional diffusion $p$ crosses a threshold; with further increase of $p$ the clusters disintegrate and another transition to a mixed phase occurs. The critical exponents of this re-entrant site-percolation transition of RTPs vary continuously along the critical line in the $\omega$-$p$ plane, but a scaling function remains invariant. This function is identical to the corresponding universal scaling function of percolation transition observed in the Ising model. We also show that the critical exponents of the underlying motility induced phase separation transition are related to corresponding percolation-critical-exponents by constant multiplicative factors known from the correspondence of magnetic and percolation critical exponents of Ising model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic theory of nonlinear electrical circuits in thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the theory of dissipative mechanics in RLC circuits, allowing for circuit elements to have nonlinear constitutive relations, and for the circuit to have arbitrary topology. We systematically generalize the dissipationless Hamiltonian mechanics of an LC circuit to account for resistors and incorporate the physical postulate that the resulting RLC circuit thermalizes with its environment at a constant positive temperature. Our theory explains stochastic fluctuations, or Johnson noise, which are mandated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Assuming Gaussian Markovian noise, we obtain exact expressions for multiplicative Johnson noise through nonlinear resistors in circuits with convenient (parasitic) capacitors and/or inductors. With linear resistors, our formalism is describable using a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger-invariant Lagrangian formalism for dissipative thermal systems. Generalizing our technique to quantum circuits could lead to an alternative way to study decoherence in nonlinear superconducting circuits without the Caldeira-Leggett formalism.</description>

      <title>Condensate Formation in a Chiral Lattice Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of condensates in a binary lattice gas in the presence of chiral interactions. These interactions differ between a given microscopic configuration and its mirror image. We consider a two dimensional lattice gas with nearest-neighbour interactions to which we add interactions involving favoured local structures that are chiral. We focus on favoured local structures that have the shape of the letter L and explore condensate formation through simulations and analytical calculations. At low temperature, this model can exhibit four different phases that are characterised by different periodic tiling patterns, depending on the strength of interactions and the chemical potential. When particle numbers are conserved, some of these phases can coexist. We analyse the structure and surface tension of interfaces between coexisting phases and determine the condensate shapes of minimal free energy. We show that these shapes can be quadrilaterals or octagons of different orientation and symmetry.</description>

      <title>A spin chain with non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric boundary couplings: exact solution, dissipative Kondo effect, and phase transitions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric non-Hermitian model where a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin chain is coupled to two spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurities at its boundaries with coupling strengths that are complex conjugates of each other. Solving the model by means of a combination of the Bethe Ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we show that the model exhibits three distinct boundary phases: a $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetric phase with a dissipative Kondo effect, a phase with bound modes and spontaneously broken $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry, and a phase with an effectively unscreened spin (i.e. a free local moment). In the Kondo and the unscreened phases, the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry is unbroken, and hence all states have real energies, whereas in the bound mode phases, in addition to the states with real energies, there exist states with complex energy eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs, signaling spontaneous breaking of the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry. The exact solution is used to provide an accessible benchmark for DMRG with a non-Hermitian matrix product operator representation that demonstrates an accuracy comparable to its Hermitian limit thus showing the power of DMRG to handle non-Hermitian many body calculations.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in [Physics Letters A, 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Segregation Kinetics of Miktoarm Star Polymers: A Dissipative Particle Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase separation kinetics of miktoarm star polymer (MSP) melts and blends with diverse architectures using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Our study focuses on symmetric and asymmetric miktoarm star polymer (SMSP/AMSP) mixtures based on arm composition and number. For a fixed MSP chain size, the characteristic microphase-separated domains initially show diffusive growth with a growth exponent $\phi \sim 1/3$ for both melts that gradually crossover to saturation at late times. The simulation results demonstrate that the evolution morphology of SMSP melts exhibits perfect dynamic scaling with varying arm numbers; the time scale follows a power-law decay with an exponent $\theta \simeq 1$ as the number of arms increases. The structural constraints on AMSP melts cause the domain growth rate to decrease as the number of one type of arms increases while their length remains fixed. This increase in the number of arms for AMSP corresponds to increased off-criticality. The saturation length in AMSP follows a power law increase with an exponent $\lambda \simeq 2/3$ as off-criticality decreases. Additionally, macrophase separation kinetics in SMSP/AMSP blends show a transition from viscous ($\phi \sim 1$) to inertial ($\phi \sim 2/3$) hydrodynamic growth regimes at late times; this exhibits the same dynamical universality class as linear polymer blends, with slight deviations at early stages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum computer offers significant advantages in simulating physical systems, particularly those with exponentially large state spaces, such as quantum systems. Stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, characterized by their stochastic nature, also exhibit exponential growth in the dimension of the state space, posing challenges for simulation at a probability distribution level. We explore the quantum simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on a digital quantum computer, directly simulating the system at the master equation level. Leveraging a spin representation of the system, we employ Trotterization and probabilistic imaginary time evolution (PITE) to simulate the probability distribution directly. We illustrate this approach through four diverse examples, ranging from simple single-lattice site generation-annihilation processes to a system featuring active-absorbing phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is described for the extrapolation of perturbative expansions in powers of asymptotically small coupling parameters or other variables onto the region of finite variables and even to the variables tending to infinity. The method involves the combination of ideas from renormalization group theory, approximation theory, dynamical theory, and optimal control theory. The extrapolation is realized by means of self-similar factor approximants, whose control parameters can be uniquely defined. The method allows to find the large-variable behavior of sought functions knowing only their small-variable expansions. Convergence and accuracy of the method are illustrated by explicit examples, including the so-called zero-dimensional field theory and anharmonic oscillator. Strong-coupling behavior of Gell-Mann-Low functions in multicomponent field theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum chromodynamics is found, being based on their weak-coupling perturbative expansions.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modelling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My methods use ideas from statistical physics and present an alternative to some recently proposed measure-theoretic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Universal bound on Ergotropy and No-Go Theorem by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</description>

      <title>A cascade model for the discontinuous absorbing phase transition between turbulent and laminar flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of energy transfer through scales to describe, at a qualitative level, the subcritical transition between laminar and turbulent flows, viewed in a statistical physics framework as a discontinuous absorbing phase transition. The main control parameter of the model is a Reynolds number that compares energy transfer to viscous dissipation on a large length scale. In spite of its simplicity, the model qualitatively reproduces a number of salient features of the subcritical laminar-turbulent transition, including the existence of an absorbing laminar state, the discontinuous onset of a metastable fluctuating turbulent state above a threshold Reynolds number, and a faster-than-exponential increase of the turbulence lifetime when increasing the Reynolds number. The behavior of the model is also consistent, at high Reynolds number, with the Kolmogorov K41 phenomenology of fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the experimental evidence of a charge-$6e$ condensed phase in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{AV_3Sb_5}$ (J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)) has sparked significant interest. At a phenomenological level, the order parameter of the $3Q$ pair-density-wave state can form either a triangular lattice or a kagome lattice, in which the vortices and antivortices locate at the center of the plaquettes. When the phase of a Cooper pair is denoted as a XY spin, the effective model for the phase fluctuation is characterized by the frustrated XY spin model on a triangular lattice with the nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling or a kagome lattice with both nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. While both models produce $\frac{1}{3}$ fractional vortex excitations, which arise as the kinks on the domain walls in the low-energy excitations, the triangular lattice model has a much larger domain wall energy than the vortex interaction energy, so the frustrated kagome lattice model becomes unique. By developing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the presence of a vestigial phase with $\frac{1}{3}$ vortex-antivortex paired phase in the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magneto-resistant oscillations observed in the recent experimental work.</description>

      <title>Extinction in agent-based and collective models of bet-hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bet-hedging is a phenotype diversification strategy that combines a fast-growing vulnerable phenotype with a slow-growing resistant phenotype. In environments switching between favorable and unfavorable conditions, bet-hedging optimizes growth and reduces fluctuations over a long time, which is expected to reduce extinction risk. Here, we address directly how bet-hedging can reduce extinction probability in an agent-based model. An agent-based model is appropriate for studying extinction due to the low number of individuals close to extinction. We also show that the agent-based model converges to the collective model behavior for populations of $100$ individuals or more. However, the collective model provides relevant qualitative insight even for low populations. The collective model provides expressions for extinction that stress the relevance of the population number, showing that a factor four increase in the total population has a greater effect than a change of strategy from maximum growth to minimal extinction. This work provides further insight into the impact of finite population effects on the bet-hedging strategy's success.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced pattern formations and melting of charge-density-wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a photo-excited charge-density-wave (CDW) state in the square-lattice Holstein model, in a setup similar to a pump-probe experiment. At half-filling, the ground state of this system is characterized by a checkerboard modulation of particle densities, accompanied by a concomitant lattice distortion. An efficient real-space dynamics method integrating the von~Neumann equation for electron density matrix and Newton equation for classical lattice dynamics is developed to simulate the dynamical evolution of a photo-excited Holstein system. We find that the energy injected by a short pump pulse results in the reduction of the CDW order and the generation of coherent phonons. At strong photoexcitations, while the CDW order is melted in the sense that the time-averaged order parameter vanishes, a dynamical CDW state is self-sustained by the strong coherent phonon oscillations. Our large-scale simulations further uncover a dynamical regime of intermediate fluence where complex pattern formation is induced by the pump pulse. The emergent spatial textures are characterized by super density modulations on top of the short-range checkerboard CDW order. Our demonstration of pattern formation highlights the significance of dynamical inhomogeneity in quantum many-body systems in pump-probe experiments.</description>

      <title>Holographic Classical Shadow Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "holographic shadows", a new class of randomized measurement schemes for classical shadow tomography that achieves the optimal scaling of sample complexity for learning geometrically local Pauli operators at any length scale, without the need for fine-tuning protocol parameters such as circuit depth or measurement rate. Our approach utilizes hierarchical quantum circuits, such as tree quantum circuits or holographic random tensor networks. Measurements within the holographic bulk correspond to measurements at different scales on the boundary (i.e. the physical system of interests), facilitating efficient quantum state estimation across observable at all scales. Considering the task of estimating string-like Pauli observables supported on contiguous intervals of $k$ sites in a 1D system, our method achieves an optimal sample complexity scaling of $\sim d^k\mathrm{poly}(k)$, with $d$ the local Hilbert space dimension. We present a holographic minimal cut framework to demonstrate the universality of this sample complexity scaling and validate it with numerical simulations, illustrating the efficacy of holographic shadows in enhancing quantum state learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Emergence of bacterial glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Densely packed, motile bacteria can adopt collective states not seen in conventional, passive materials. These states remain in many ways mysterious, and their physical characterization can aid our understanding of natural bacterial colonies and biofilms as well as materials in general. Here, we overcome challenges associated with generating uniformly growing, large, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial assemblies by a membrane-based microfluidic device and report the emergence of glassy states in two-dimensional suspension of Escherichia coli. As the number density increases by cell growth, populations of motile bacteria transition to a glassy state, where cells are packed and unable to move. This takes place in two steps, the first one suppressing only the orientational modes and the second one vitrifying the motion completely. Characterizing each phase through statistical analyses and investigations of individual motion of bacteria, we find not only characteristic features of glass such as rapid slowdown, dynamic heterogeneity and cage effects, but also a few properties distinguished from those of thermal glass. These distinctive properties include the spontaneous formation of micro-domains of aligned cells with collective motion, the appearance of an unusual signal in the dynamic susceptibility, and the dynamic slowdown with a density dependence generally forbidden for thermal systems. Our results are expected to capture general characteristics of such active rod glass, which may serve as a physical mechanism underlying dense bacterial aggregates.</description>

Abstract: We analytically derive universal bounds that describe the trade-off between thermodynamic cost and precision in a sequence of events related to some internal changes of an otherwise hidden physical system. The precision is quantified by the fluctuations in either the number of events counted over time or the times between successive events. Our results are valid for the same broad class of nonequilibrium driven systems considered by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, but they extend to both time-symmetric and asymmetric observables. We show how optimal precision saturating the bounds can be achieved. For waiting time fluctuations of asymmetric observables, a phase transition in the optimal configuration arises, where higher precision can be achieved by combining several signals.</description>

Abstract: Active matter systems, from self-propelled colloids to motile bacteria, are characterized by the conversion of free energy into useful work at the microscopic scale. They involve physics beyond the reach of equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a persistent challenge has been to understand the nature of their nonequilibrium states. The entropy production rate and the probability current provide quantitative ways to do so by measuring the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry. Yet, their efficient computation has remained elusive, as they depend on the system's unknown and high-dimensional probability density. Here, building upon recent advances in generative modeling, we develop a deep learning framework to estimate the score of this density. We show that the score, together with the microscopic equations of motion, gives access to the entropy production rate, the probability current, and their decomposition into local contributions from individual particles. To represent the score, we introduce a novel, spatially-local transformer network architecture that learns high-order interactions between particles while respecting their underlying permutation symmetry. We demonstrate the broad utility and scalability of the method by applying it to several high-dimensional systems of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We show that a single network trained on a system of 4096 particles at one packing fraction can generalize to other regions of the phase diagram, including systems with as many as 32768 particles. We use this observation to quantify the spatial structure of the departure from equilibrium in MIPS as a function of the number of particles and the packing fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the term ``quantum chaos'' refers to spectral correlations similar to those found in the random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is equivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the system is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large values at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole disappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a relatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected with commercially available quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum, Chandler and Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of phase space distributions to microcanonical equilibrium: dynamical isometry and generalized coarse-graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the manner in which classical phase space distribution functions converge to the microcanonical distribution. We first prove a theorem about the lack of convergence, then define a generalization of the coarse-graining procedure that leads to convergence. We prove that the time evolution of phase space distributions is an isometry for a broad class of statistical distance metrics, implying that ensembles do not get any closer to (or farther from) equilibrium, according to these metrics. This extends the known result that strong convergence of phase space distributions to the microcanonical distribution does not occur. However, it has long been known that weak convergence can occur, such that coarse-grained distributions--defined by partitioning phase space into a finite number of cells--converge pointwise to the microcanonical distribution. We define a generalization of coarse-graining that removes the need for partitioning phase space into cells. We prove that our generalized coarse-grained distribution converges pointwise to the microcanonical distribution if the dynamics are strong mixing. As an example, we study an ensemble of triangular billiard systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of the Blinking-Checkers Model for Polyamorphic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.</description>

      <title>Sampling metastable systems using collective variables and Jarzynski-Crooks paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a high dimensional multimodal target probability measure. We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>An integral-free representation of the Dyson series using divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dyson series is an infinite sum of multi-dimensional time-ordered integrals, which serves as a formal representation of the quantum time-evolution operator in the interaction-picture. Using the mathematical tool of divided differences, we introduce an alternative representation for the series that is entirely free from both time ordering and integrals. In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr{\"o}dinger-picture. We showcase the utility of this novel representation by studying a number of use cases. We also discuss several immediate applications.</description>

      <title>Entropy-based random models for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network theory has primarily focused on pairwise relationships, disregarding many-body interactions: neglecting them, however, can lead to misleading representations of complex systems. Hypergraphs represent an increasingly popular alternative for describing polyadic interactions: our innovation lies in leveraging the representation of hypergraphs based on the incidence matrix for extending the entropy-based framework to higher-order structures. In analogy with the Exponential Random Graphs, we name the members of this novel class of models Exponential Random Hypergraphs. Here, we focus on two explicit examples, i.e. the generalisations of the Erd\"os-R\'enyi Model and of the Configuration Model. After discussing their asymptotic properties, we employ them to analyse real-world configurations: more specifically, i) we extend the definition of several network quantities to hypergraphs, ii) compute their expected value under each null model and iii) compare it with the empirical one, in order to detect deviations from random behaviours. Differently from currently available techniques, ours is analytically tractable, scalable and effective in singling out the structural patterns of real-world hypergraphs differing significantly from those emerging as a consequence of simpler, structural constraints.</description>

      <title>Boundary deconfined quantum criticality at transitions between symmetry-protected topological chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades of research have revealed a deep understanding of topological quantum matter with protected edge modes. We report that even richer physics emerges when tuning between two topological phases of matter whose respective edge modes are incompatible. The frustration at the edge leads to novel boundary physics, such as symmetry-breaking phases with exotic non-Landau transitions -- even when the edge is zero-dimensional. As a minimal case study we consider spin chains with $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, exhibiting two nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. At the bulk 1+1D critical transition between these SPT phases, we find two stable 0+1D boundary phases, each spontaneously breaking one of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetries. Furthermore, we find that a single boundary parameter tunes a non-Landau boundary critical transition between these two phases. This constitutes a 0+1D version of an exotic phenomenon driven by charged vortex condensation known as deconfined quantum criticality. This work highlights the rich unexplored physics of criticality between nontrivial topological phases and provides insights into the burgeoning field of gapless topological phases.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures for integrable polymers on a strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the stationary measures for the free-energy increment process for the geometric last passage percolation (LPP) and log-gamma polymer model on a diagonal strip is given by a marginal of a two-layer Gibbs measure with a simple and explicit description. This result is shown subject to certain restrictions on the parameters controlling the weights on the boundary of the strip. However, from this description and an analytic continuation argument we are able to access the stationary measure for all boundary parameters. Taking an intermediate disorder limit of the log-gamma polymer stationary measure in a strip we readily recover (modulo convergence of the polymer to the open KPZ equation, Conjecture 4.2) the conjectural description from arXiv:2105.15178 of the open KPZ stationary measure for all choices of boundary parameters $u,v\in \mathbb{R}$ (thus going beyond the restriction $u+v\geq 0$ from arXiv:2103.12253).</description>

      <title>Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: Achieving dynamic manipulation and control of single molecules at high spatio-temporal resolution is pivotal for advancing atomic-scale computing and nanorobotics. However, this endeavour is critically challenged by complex nature of atomic and molecular interactions, high-dimensional characteristics of nanoscale systems, and scarcity of experimental data. Here, we present a toy model for controlling single-molecule diffusion by harnessing electrostatic forces arising from elementary surface charges within a lattice structure, mimicking embedded charges on a surface. We investigate the interplay between quantum mechanics and electrostatic interactions in single molecule diffusion processes using a combination of state-dependent diffusion equations and Green's functions. We find that surface charge density critically influences diffusion coefficients, exhibiting linear scaling akin to Coulombic forces. We achieve accurate predictions of experimental diffusion constants and extending the observed range to values reaching up to 6000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$ and 80000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$. The molecular trajectories predicted by our model bear resemblance to planetary motion, particularly in their gravity-assisted acceleration-like behaviour. It holds transformative implications for nanorobotics, motion control at the nanoscale, and computing applications, particularly in the areas of molecular and quantum computing where the trapping of atoms and molecules is essential. Beyond the state-of-the-art optical lattice and scanning tunnelling microscopy for atomic/molecular manipulation, our findings give unambiguous advantage of precise control over single-molecule dynamics through quantum manipulation at the angstrom scale.</description>

      <title>Scale and conformal invariance in rotating interacting few-fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that rotating two-dimensional Fermi gases possess a nonrelativistic scale and conformal invariance at weak but nonzero interactions, where the scale invariance of universal short-range interactions is not yet broken by quantum effects. We demonstrate the symmetry in the excitation spectrum of few-fermion ensembles in a harmonic trap obtained by exact diagonalization. The excitation spectrum is shown to split in a set of primary states and derived excited states that consist of breathing modes as well as two different center-of-mass excitations, which describe cyclotron and guiding-center excitations of the total particle cloud. Furthermore, the conformal symmetry is manifest in the many-body wave function, where it dictates the form of the hyperradial component, which we demonstrate using Monte Carlo sampling of few-body wave functions.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

      <title>Temperature inversion in a non-homogeneous collisionless plasma with a thermal boundary: the temporal coarse-graining method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompted by the relevant problem of temperature inversion (i.e. gradient of density anti-correlated to the gradient of temperature) in astrophysics, we introduce a novel method to model a gravitationally confined multi-component collisionless plasma in contact with a fluctuating thermal boundary. We focus on systems with anti-correlated (inverted) density and temperature profiles, with applications to solar physics. The dynamics of the plasma is analytically described via the coupling of an appropriated coarse-grained distribution function and temporally coarse-grained Vlasov dynamics. We derive a stationary solution of the system and predict the inverted density and temperature profiles of the two-species for scenarios relevant for the corona. We validate our method by comparing the analytical results with kinetic numerical simulations of the plasma dynamics in the context of the two-species Hamiltonian mean-field model (HMF). Finally, we apply our theoretical framework to the problem of the temperature inversion in the solar corona obtaining density and temperature profiles in remarkably good agreement with the observations.</description>

Abstract: We study solutions of the reflection equation related to the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$. First, we explain how to construct a family of stochastic integrable vertex models with fixed boundary conditions. Then, we construct upper- and lower-triangular solutions of the reflection equation related to symmetric tensor representations of $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$ with arbitrary spin. We also prove the star-star relation for the Boltzmann weights of the Ising-type model, conjectured by Bazhanov and Sergeev, and use it to verify certain properties of the solutions obtained.</description>

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a simple liquid whose particles, in addition to standard potential-based interactions, are also subjected to transverse forces preserving the Boltzmann distribution. We derive the effective dynamics of one and two tracer particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. We determine the amount of acceleration of the dynamics caused by the transverse forces, in particular in the vicinity of the glass transition. We analyze the emergence and evolution of odd transport phenomena induced by the transverse forces.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and coarsening dynamics in dry apolar active nematics with reciprocal local alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic dynamics. The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and fluctuation-dominated. Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics with nematic ordering preceding particle clustering and similar scaling behaviors for density and nematic fields, exhibiting dynamic exponents between 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>
