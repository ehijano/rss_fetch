      <title>Sampling with Shielded Langevin Monte Carlo Using Navigation Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce shielded Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), a constrained sampler inspired by navigation functions, capable of sampling from unnormalized target distributions defined over punctured supports. In other words, this approach samples from non-convex spaces defined as convex sets with convex holes. This defines a novel and challenging problem in constrained sampling. To do so, the sampler incorporates a combination of a spatially adaptive temperature and a repulsive drift to ensure that samples remain within the feasible region. Experiments on a 2D Gaussian mixture and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbol detection showcase the advantages of the proposed shielded LMC in contrast to unconstrained cases.</description>

      <title>On the Choice of Model Space Priors and Multiplicity Control in Bayesian Variable Selection: An Application to Streaming Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian variable selection (BVS) depends critically on the specification of a prior distribution over the model space, particularly for controlling sparsity and multiplicity. This paper examines the practical consequences of different model space priors for BVS in logistic regression, with an emphasis on streaming data settings. We review some popular and well-known Beta--Binomial priors alongside the recently proposed matryoshka doll (MD) prior. We introduce a simple approximation to the MD prior that yields independent inclusion indicators and is convenient for scalable inference. Using BIC-based approximations to marginal likelihoods, we compare the effect of different model space priors on posterior inclusion probabilities and coefficient estimation at intermediate and final stages of the data stream via simulation studies. Overall, the results indicate that no single model space prior uniformly dominates across scenarios, and that the recently proposed MD prior provides a useful additional option that occupies an intermediate position between commonly used Beta--Binomial priors with differing degrees of sparsity.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern fields and sparse spatial extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Gaussian fields are used in many areas of statistics as models for spatial or spatio-temporal dependence, or as priors for latent variables. However, there are two major gaps in the literature: first, the number and flexibility of existing intrinsic models are very limited; second, theory, fast inference, and software are currently underdeveloped for intrinsic fields. We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Minimax Optimal Estimator For Multivariate Convex Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the computational aspects of multivariate convex regression in dimensions $d \ge 5$. Our results include the \emph{first} estimators that are minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) with polynomial runtime in the sample size for both $L$-Lipschitz convex regression, and $\Gamma$-bounded convex regression under polytopal support. Our analysis combines techniques from empirical process theory, stochastic geometry, and potential theory, and leverages recent algorithmic advances in mean estimation for random vectors and in distribution-free linear regression. These results provide the first efficient, minimax-optimal procedures for non-Donsker classes for which their corresponding least-squares estimator is provably minimax-suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Image Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mediation analysis aims to separate the indirect effect through mediators from the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome. It is challenging to perform mediation analysis with neuroimaging data which involves high dimensionality, complex spatial correlations, sparse activation patterns and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. To address these issues, we develop a new spatially varying coefficient structural equation model for Bayesian Image Mediation Analysis (BIMA). We define spatially varying mediation effects within the potential outcomes framework, employing a soft-thresholded Gaussian process prior for functional parameters. We establish posterior consistency for spatially varying mediation effects along with selection consistency on important regions that contribute to the mediation effects. We develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm scalable to analysis of large-scale imaging data. Through extensive simulations, we show that BIMA can improve the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency for high-dimensional mediation analysis over existing methods. We apply BIMA to analyze behavioral and fMRI data in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study with a focus on inferring the mediation effects of the parental education level on the children's general cognitive ability that are mediated through the working memory brain activity.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed.
  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>A Lanczos-Based Algorithmic Approach for Spike Detection in Large Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the number of spikes in a general class of spiked covariance models without directly computing the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. This approach is based on the Lanczos algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the associated Jacobi matrix and its Cholesky factorization. A key aspect of the analysis is interpreting the eigenvector spectral distribution as a perturbation of its asymptotic counterpart. The specific exponential-type asymptotics of the Jacobi matrix enables an efficient approximation of the Stieltjes transform of the asymptotic spectral distribution via a finite continued fraction. As a consequence, we also obtain estimates for the density of the asymptotic distribution and the location of outliers. We provide consistency guarantees for our proposed estimators, proving their convergence in the high-dimensional regime. We demonstrate that, when applied to standard spiked covariance models, our approach outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency and runtime, while still maintaining robustness to exotic population covariances.</description>

      <title>Beyond Basic A/B testing: Improving Statistical Efficiency for Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we (i) show the statistical efficiency of using estimating equation and U statistics, which can address these issues separately; and (ii) propose a novel doubly robust generalized U that allows flexible definition of treatment effect, and can handles small samples, distribution robustness, ROI and confounding consideration in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotics and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies, apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests at LinkedIn, and share results and learnings that are broadly useful.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Reconstructing B Cell Lineages in the Presence of Context-Dependent Somatic Hypermutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for approximating posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ancestral sequences under models of sequence evolution with site-dependence, where standard phylogenetic likelihood computations (pruning) fail. Our approach uses a combined data-augmentation and importance sampling scheme. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to leverage existing highly optimized phylogenetic software. We apply our approach to the reconstruction of B cell receptor affinity maturation lineages from high-throughput repertoire sequencing data and evaluate the impact of incorporating site-dependence on the reconstruction accuracy of both trees and ancestral sequences. We show that accounting for context-dependence during inference always improves the estimates of both ancestral sequences and lineage trees on simulated datasets. We also examine the impact of incorporating priors based on VDJ recombination models, and find that they significantly improve ancestral sequence reconstruction in germline-encoded regions, but increase errors in non-templated nucleotides. We propose a modified, piecewise prior to address this demonstrate that it improves empirical reconstruction accuracy. We apply our approach to the analysis of the HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies DH270 and CH235 which are important targets of current vaccine design efforts.</description>
