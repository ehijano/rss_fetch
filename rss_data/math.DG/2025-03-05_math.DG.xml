      <title>Gauduchon metrics and Hermite-Einstein metrics on non-K\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of Gauduchon metrics on arbitrary compact hermitian varieties, generalizing our previous work on smoothable singularities. These metrics allow us to define the notion of slope stability for torsion-free coherent sheaves on compact normal varieties that are not necessarily K\"ahler. Then we prove the existence and uniqueness of singular Hermite-Einstein metrics for slope-stable reflexive sheaves on non-K\"ahler normal varieties.</description>

      <title>Riemannian flow techniques on totally geodesic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the existence of totally geodesic null hypersurface on the properties of a Lorentzian manifold. By coupling the rigging technique with the existence of a null foliation we prove the existence of a Riemann flow structure which allows us to use powerful results to show how curvature conditions on the spacetime restricts its causal structure. We also study the existence of periodic null or spacelike geodesic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review various aspects of Sasaki-Einstein and GK geometry, emphasising their similarities, interconnections and significance for the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we highlight the key role that physical considerations have played in formulating geometric extremization principles, which have been instrumental in both understanding the geometry and identifying the corresponding dual field theories.</description>

      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <title>Regularity for free boundary surfaces minimizing degenerate area functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an epsilon-regularity theorem at points in the free boundary of almost-minimizers of the energy $\mathrm{Per}_{w}(E)=\int_{\partial^*E}w\,\mathrm{d} {\mathscr{H}}^{n-1}$, where $w$ is a weight asymptotic to $d(\cdot,\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\Omega)^a$ near $\partial\Omega$ and $a&gt;0$.
  This implies that the boundaries of almost-minimizers are $C^{1,\gamma_0}$-surfaces that touch $\partial \Omega$ orthogonally, up to a Singular Set $\mathrm{Sing}(\partial E)$ whose Hausdorff dimension satisfies the bound
  $d_{\mathscr{H}}(\mathrm{Sing}(\partial E)) \leq n +a -(5+\sqrt{8})$.</description>

      <title>Local and global minimality of level sets in phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove local and global minimality of the zero level set with respect to certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In particular, we establish that the zero level set of minimizers of the Allen-Cahn equation locally minimizes a perimeter type functional. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture, proved by O. Savin, by reducing it to a Bernstein type result for anisotropic perimeter functionals obtained by L. Simon, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry insights in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the fundamental role of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in deep learning, particularly in the context of Boltzmann machines and energy-based models. We first review the structure of Boltzmann learning and its relation to free energy minimization. We then establish a connection between optimal transport theory and deep learning, demonstrating how the Monge-Amp\`ere equation governs probability transformations in generative models. Additionally, we provide insights from quantum geometry, showing that the space of covariance matrices arising in the learning process coincides with the Connes-Araki-Haagerup (CAH) cone in von Neumann algebra theory. Furthermore, we introduce an alternative approach based on renormalization group (RG) flow, which, while distinct from the optimal transport perspective, reveals another manifestation of the Monge-Amp\`ere domain in learning dynamics. This dual perspective offers a deeper mathematical understanding of hierarchical feature learning, bridging concepts from statistical mechanics, quantum geometry, and deep learning theory.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Semistable Points and Nonabelian Convexity of Gradient Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the action of a real reductive group $G$ on a Kahler manifold $Z$ which is the restriction of a holomorphic action of a complex reductive Lie group $U^\mathbb{C}.$ We assume that the action of $U$, a maximal compact connected subgroup of $U^\mathbb{C}$ on $Z$ is Hamiltonian. If $G\subset U^\mathbb{C}$ is compatible, there is a corresponding gradient map $\mu_\mathfrak{p}: Z\to \mathfrak{p}$, where $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$ is a Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra of $G$. Our main results are the openness and connectedness of the set of semistable points associated with $G$-action on $Z$, a convexity theorem for the $G$-action on a $G$-invariant compact Lagrangian submanifold of $Z$, and a convexity result for two-orbit variety.</description>

      <title>Translators to Higher Order Mean Curvature Flows in $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider translators to the extrinsic flows in $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R$ (called $r$-mean curvature flows or $r$-MCF, for short) whose velocity functions are the higher order mean curvatures $H_r.$ We show that there exist rotational bowl-type and catenoid-type translators to $r$-MCF in both $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R,$ and also that there exist parabolic and hyperbolic catenoid-type translators to $r$-MCF in $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R.$ In addition, we show that there exist Grim Reaper-type translators to Gaussian flow ($n$-MCF) in $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R$. We also establish the uniqueness of all these translators (together with certain cylinders) among those which are invariant by either rotations or translations (Euclidean, parabolic or hyperbolic). We apply this uniqueness result to classify the translators to $r$-MCF in $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R$ whose $r$-th mean curvature is constant, as well as those which are isoparametric. Our results extend to the context of $r$-MCF in $\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb H^n\times\mathbb R$ the existence and uniqueness theorems by Altschuler--Wu (of the bowl soliton) and Clutterbuck--Schn\"urer--Schulze (of the translating catenoids) in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Spectrally distinguishing symmetric spaces I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible symmetric space of complex structures on $\mathbb R^{2n}$ (resp.\ quaternionic structures on $\mathbb C^{2n}$) is spectrally unique within a $2$-parameter (resp.\ $3$-parameter) family of homogeneous metrics on the underlying differentiable manifold. Such families are strong candidates to contain all homogeneous metrics admitted on the corresponding manifolds.
  The main tool in the proof is an explicit expression for the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated to each homogeneous metric involved. As a second consequence of this expression, we prove that any non-symmetric Einstein metric in the homogeneous families mentioned above is $\nu$-unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Steklov problem on differential $p$-forms defined by M. Karpukhin and present geometric eigenvalue bounds in the setting of warped product manifolds in various scenarios. In particular, we obtain Escobar type lower bounds for warped product manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, and certain sharp bounds for hypersurfaces of revolution, among others. We compare and contrast the behaviour with known results in the case of functions (i.e., $0$-forms), highlighting the influence of the underlying topology on the spectrum for $p$-forms in general.</description>

      <title>Seiberg-Witten equations in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with an $n$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold with a Spin-c structure, we describe an elliptic system of equations which recover the Seiberg-Witten equations when $n=3,4$. The equations are for a U(1)-connection $A$ and spinor $\phi$, as usual, and also an odd degree form $\beta$ (generally of inhomogeneous degree). From $A$ and $\beta$ we define a Dirac operator $D_{A,\beta}$ using the action of $\beta$ and $*\beta$ on spinors (with carefully chosen coefficients) to modify $D_A$. The first equation in our system is $D_{A,\beta}(\phi)=0$. The left-hand side of the second equation is the principal part of the Weitzenb\"ock remainder for $D^*_{A,\beta}D_{A,\beta}$. The equation sets this equal to $q(\phi)$, the trace-free part of projection against $\phi$, as is familiar from the cases $n=3,4$. In dimensions $n=4m$ and $n=2m+1$, this gives an elliptic system modulo gauge. To obtain a system which is elliptic modulo gauge in dimensions $n=4m+2$, we use two spinors and two connections, and so have two Dirac and two curvature equations, that are then coupled via the form $\beta$. We also prove a collection of a priori estimates for solutions to these equations. Unfortunately they are not sufficient to prove compactness modulo gauge, instead leaving the possibility that bubbling may occur.</description>

      <title>A new look at unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a symplectic toric manifold we consider half-form quantization in mixed polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, associated to the action of a subtorus $T^p\subset T^n$. The real directions in these polarizations are generated by components of the $T^p$ moment map.
  Polarizations of this type can be obtained by starting at a toric K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ and then following
  Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of the torus subgroup. These geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via a generalized coherent state transform (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.
  The polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ give a new way of looking at the problem of unitarity in the quantization commutes with reduction with respect to the $T^p$-action, as follows. The prequantum operators for the components of the moment map of the $T^p$-action act diagonally with discrete spectrum corresponding to the integral points of the moment polytope. The Hilbert space for the quantization with respect to $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ then naturally decomposes as a direct sum of the Hilbert spaces for all its quantizable coisotropic reductions which, in fact, are the K\"ahler reductions of the initial K\"ahler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$. This will be shown to imply that, for the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, quantization commutes unitarily with reduction. The problem of unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for $\mathcal{P}_0$ is then equivalent to the question of whether quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ is unitarily equivalent with quantization in the polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$. In fact, this does not hold in general in the toric case.</description>
