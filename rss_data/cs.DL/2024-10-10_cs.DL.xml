      <title>KwicKwocKwac, a tool for rapidly generating concordances and marking up a literary text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces KwicKwocKwac 1.0 (KwicKK), a web application designed to enhance the annotation and enrichment of digital texts in the humanities. KwicKK provides a user-friendly interface that enables scholars and researchers to perform semi-automatic markup of textual documents, facilitating the identification of relevant entities such as people, organizations, and locations. Key functionalities include the visualization of annotated texts using KeyWord in Context (KWIC), KeyWord Out Of Context (KWOC), and KeyWord After Context (KWAC) methodologies, alongside automatic disambiguation of generic references and integration with Wikidata for Linked Open Data connections. The application supports metadata input and offers multiple download formats, promoting accessibility and ease of use. Developed primarily for the National Edition of Aldo Moro's works, KwicKK aims to lower the technical barriers for users while fostering deeper engagement with digital scholarly resources. The architecture leverages contemporary web technologies, ensuring scalability and reliability. Future developments will explore user experience enhancements, collaborative features, and integration of additional data sources.</description>

      <title>WorkflowHub: a registry for computational workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising popularity of computational workflows is driven by the need for repetitive and scalable data processing, sharing of processing know-how, and transparent methods. As both combined records of analysis and descriptions of processing steps, workflows should be reproducible, reusable, adaptable, and available. Workflow sharing presents opportunities to reduce unnecessary reinvention, promote reuse, increase access to best practice analyses for non-experts, and increase productivity. In reality, workflows are scattered and difficult to find, in part due to the diversity of available workflow engines and ecosystems, and because workflow sharing is not yet part of research practice.
  WorkflowHub provides a unified registry for all computational workflows that links to community repositories, and supports both the workflow lifecycle and making workflows findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). By interoperating with diverse platforms, services, and external registries, WorkflowHub adds value by supporting workflow sharing, explicitly assigning credit, enhancing FAIRness, and promoting workflows as scholarly artefacts. The registry has a global reach, with hundreds of research organisations involved, and more than 700 workflows registered.</description>

      <title>An Overview of zbMATH Open Digital Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical research thrives on the effective dissemination and discovery of knowledge.
  zbMATH Open has emerged as a pivotal platform in this landscape, offering a comprehensive repository of mathematical literature. Beyond indexing and abstracting, it serves as a unified quality-assured infrastructure for finding, evaluating, and connecting mathematical information that advances mathematical research as well as interdisciplinary exploration. zbMATH Open enables scientific quality control by post-publication reviews and promotes connections between researchers, institutions, and research outputs. This paper represents the functionalities of the most significant features of this open-access service, highlighting its role in shaping the future of mathematical information retrieval.</description>

      <title>FAIR GPT: A virtual consultant for research data management in ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FAIR GPT is a first virtual consultant in ChatGPT designed to help researchers and organizations make their data and metadata compliant with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. It provides guidance on metadata improvement, dataset organization, and repository selection. To ensure accuracy, FAIR GPT uses external APIs to assess dataset FAIRness, retrieve controlled vocabularies, and recommend repositories, minimizing hallucination and improving precision. It also assists in creating documentation (data and software management plans, README files, and codebooks), and selecting proper licenses. This paper describes its features, applications, and limitations.</description>

      <title>The Transparent Relations Ontology (TRO): a vocabulary to describe conflicts of interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transparent Relations Ontology (TRO) offers a vocabulary to publish data about relations between powerful parties that should be more transparent, in order to detect possible conflicts of interest. TRO is based on minimal modelling, reusing common vocabularies to offer a simple yet useful resource to publish interoperable data about pointers to relations that might result in corruption cases. Additionally, best practices have been followed in order to sustain a technically rigorous ontology development process. A usage example with real data is mentioned, integrating information from Basque Government's Open Data services and a news outlet. Building upon its foundational design, future enhancements of TRO could significantly amplify its utility in uncovering and scrutinizing opaque relationships that may lead to corruption.</description>
