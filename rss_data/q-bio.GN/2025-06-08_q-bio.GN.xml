      <title>Scalable Generation of Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images via Whole-Slide Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.</description>

      <title>UniPTMs: The First Unified Multi-type PTM Site Prediction Model via Master-Slave Architecture-Based Multi-Stage Fusion Strategy and Hierarchical Contrastive Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences, structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.</description>
