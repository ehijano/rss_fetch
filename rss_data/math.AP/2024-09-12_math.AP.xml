      <title>Non-local dissipative Aw-Rascle model and its relation with Matrix-valued communication in Euler alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the multi-dimensional generalisation of the Aw-Rascle model with the pressureless Euler-alignment system, in which the communication weight is matrix-valued. Our generalisation includes the velocity offset in the form of a gradient of a non-local density function, given by the convolution with a kernel $K$. We investigate connections between these models at the macroscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic (hydrodynamic) level, and overview the results on the mean-field limit for various assumptions on $K$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness, magnetic helicity conservation, inviscid limit and asymptotic stability for the generalized Navier-Stokes-Maxwell equations with the Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the well-posedness, (conditional) conservation of magnetic helicity, inviscid limit and asymptotic stability of the generalized Navier-Stokes-Maxwell equations (NSM) under the Hall effect in two and three dimensions. More precisely, in the viscous case we prove the global well-posedness of NSM for small initial data, which allows us to establish a connection with either the Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (H-MHD) system as the speed of light tends to infinity or NSM without the Hall coefficient as this constant goes to zero. In addition, in the inviscid case the local well-posedness of NSM is also obtained for possibly large initial data. Moreover, under suitable conditions on the initial data and additional assumptions of solutions to NSM in three dimensions, the magnetic helicity is conserved as the electric conductivity goes to infinity. It is different to the case of the fractional H-MHD with critical fractional Laplacian exponents for both the velocity and magnetic fields, where the conservation of magnetic helicity can be provided for smooth initial data without any further conditions on the solution. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of NSM around a constant magnetic field is established in the case of having a velocity damping term.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results on $\Gamma$-limits of sequences of free-discontinuity functionals with bounded cohesive surface terms are extended to the case of vector-valued functions. In this framework, we prove an integral representation result for the $\Gamma$-limit, which is then used to study deterministic and stochastic homogenisation problems for this type of functionals.</description>

      <title>Interpolation scattering for wave equations with singular potentials and singular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a construction of scattering for wave-type equations with singular potentials on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in a framework of weak-$L^p$ spaces. First, we use an Yamazaki-type estimate for wave groups on Lorentz spaces and fixed point arguments to prove the global well-posedness for wave-type equations on weak-$L^p$ spaces. Then, we provide a corresponding scattering results in such singular framework. Finally, we use also the dispersive estimates to establish the polynomial stability and improve the decay of scattering.</description>

      <title>On singular behaviour in a plane linear elastostatics problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vector field similar to those separately introduced by Artstein and Dafermos is constructed from the tangent to a monotone increasing one-parameter family of non-concentric circles that touch at the common point of intersection taken as the origin. The circles define and space-fill a lens shaped region $\Omega$ whose outer and inner boundaries are the greatest and least circles. The double cusp at the origin creates a geometric singularity at which the vector field is indeterminate and has non-unique limiting behaviour. A semi-inverse method that involves the Airy stress function then shows that the vector field corresponds to the displacement vector field for a linear plane compressible non-homogeneous isotropic elastostatic equilibrium problem in $\Omega$ whose boundaries are rigidly rotated relative to each other, possibly causing rupture or tearing at the origin. A sequence of solutions is found for which not only are the Lam\'{e} parameters strongly-elliptic, but the non-unique limiting behaviour of the displacement is preserved. Other properties of the vector field are also established.</description>

      <title>Emergence of peaked singularities in the Euler-Poisson system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Euler-Poisson system equipped with the Boltzmann relation and provide the exact asymptotic behavior of the peaked solitary wave solutions near the peak. This enables us to study the cold ion limit of the peaked solitary waves with the sharp range of H\"older exponents. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for $C^1$ blow-up solutions to the pressureless Euler-Poisson system, whose blow-up profiles are asymptotically similar to its peaked solitary waves and exhibit a different form of blow-up compared to the Burgers-type (shock-like) blow-up.</description>

      <title>Quantitative periodic homogenization for symmetric non-local stable-like operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenization for non-local operators in periodic environments has been studied intensively. So far, these works are mainly devoted to the qualitative results, that is, to determine explicitly the operators in the limit. To the best of authors' knowledge, there is no result concerning the convergence rates of the homogenization for stable-like operators in periodic environments. In this paper, we establish a quantitative homogenization result for symmetric $\alpha$-stable-like operators on $\R^d$ with periodic coefficients. In particular, we show that the convergence rate for the solutions of associated Dirichlet problems on a bounded domain $D$ is of order $$ \varepsilon^{(2-\alpha)/2}\I_{\{\alpha\in (1,2)\}}+\varepsilon^{\alpha/2}\I_{\{\alpha\in (0,1)\}}+\varepsilon^{1/2}|\log \e|^2\I_{\{\alpha=1\}}, $$ while, when the solution to the equation in the limit is in $C^2_c(D)$, the convergence rate becomes
  $$ \varepsilon^{2-\alpha}\I_{\{\alpha\in (1,2)\}}+\varepsilon^{\alpha}\I_{\{\alpha\in (0,1)\}}+\varepsilon |\log \e|^2\I_{\{\alpha=1\}}. $$ This indicates that the boundary decay behaviors of the solution to the equation in the limit affects the convergence rate in the homogenization.</description>

      <title>Steady Ring-Shaped Vortex Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct traveling wave solutions to the two-phase Euler equations, featuring a vortex sheet at the interface between the two phases. The inner phase exhibits a uniform vorticity distribution and may represent a vacuum, forming what is known as a hollow vortex. These traveling waves take the form of ring-shaped vortices with a small cross-sectional radius, referred to as thin rings. Our construction is based on the implicit function theorem, which also guarantees local uniqueness of the solutions. Additionally, we derive asymptotics for the speed of the ring, generalizing the well-known Kelvin--Hicks formula to cases that include surface tension.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <title>Stability and instability of solitary waves in fractional generalized KdV equation in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stability of solitary wave solutions for the fractional generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ \partial_t u- \partial_{x_1} D^{\alpha}u+ \tfrac{1}{m}\partial_{x_1}(u^m)=0, ~ (x_1,\dots,x_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d, \, \, t\in \mathbb{R}, \, \, 0&lt;\alpha &lt;2, $$ in any spatial dimension $d\geq 1$ and nonlinearity $m&gt;1$. The arguments developed here are independent of the spatial dimension and rely on the new estimates for spatial decay of ground states and their regularity. In the $L^2$-subcritical case, we prove the orbital stability of solitary waves using the concentration-compactness argument, the commutator estimates and expansions of nonlocal operator $D^\alpha$ in several variables. In the $L^2$-supercritical case, we show that solitary waves are unstable. More precisely, the instability is obtained by constructing an explicit sequence of initial conditions that move away from a soliton orbit in finite time, this is shown in conjunction with the modulation and truncation arguments, and incorporating the decay and regularity of the ground states.
  As a consequence, in 1D we show the instability of solitary waves of the supercritical generalized Benjamin-Ono equation ($\alpha=1$) and the dispersion-generalized Benjamin-Ono equation ($1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$); furthermore, new results on the instability are obtained in the weaker dispersion regime when $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. This work should be of interest in studying stability of solitary waves and other coherent structures in a variety of dispersive equations that involve nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric conditions, lower semicontinuity, and existence results for perimeter functionals with measure data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish lower semicontinuity results for perimeter functionals with measure data on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and deduce the existence of minimizers to these functionals with Dirichlet boundary conditions, obstacles, or volume-constraints. In other words, we lay foundations of a perimeter-based variational approach to mean curvature measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ capable of proving existence in various prescribed-mean-curvature problems with measure data. As crucial and essentially optimal assumption on the measure data we identify a new condition, called small-volume isoperimetric condition, which sharply captures cancellation effects and comes with surprisingly many properties and reformulations in itself. In particular, we show that the small-volume isoperimetric condition is satisfied for a wide class of $(n{-}1)$-dimensional measures, which are thus admissible in our theory. Our analysis includes infinite measures and semicontinuity results on very general domains.</description>

Further we study the dynamics of the probability flow between the bounded sub-graph and the unbounded ends.</description>

Abstract: We show that regular solutions to electron-MHD with resistivity can be continued as long as the time integral of the supremum of the current gradient remains finite. This dimensionless continuation criterion is analogous to the celebrated result of Beale--Kato--Majda for the incompressible Euler and Navier--Stokes equations. A similar continuation criterion, formulated in terms of the time integral of the supremum of the vorticity, velocity gradient and current gradient, is established for the Hall-MHD with resistivity as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a new admissibility criterion for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. The criterion is motivated by the classical least action principle but is now applied to initial value problems which exhibit non-unique solutions. Examples are provided to Lagrangian mechanics and the Euler equations of barotropic fluid mechanics. In particular an example is provided which shows the least action admissibility principle prefers the classical two shock solution to the Riemann initial value problem to solutions generated by convex integration, yet for the same example Dafermos's entropy rate criterion prefers the convex integration solutions to the two shock solution.</description>

      <title>Complex structure degenerations and collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.03368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make progress on understanding the collapsing behavior of Calabi-Yau metrics on a degenerating family of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the case of a family of smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in projective space degenerating into the transversal union of two smooth Fano hypersurfaces in a generic way, we obtain a complete result in all dimensions establishing explicit and precise relationships between the metric collapsing and complex structure degenerations. This result is new even in complex dimension two. This is achieved via gluing and singular perturbation techniques, and a key geometric ingredient involving the construction of certain (not necessarily smooth) K\"ahler metrics with torus symmetry. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Thomas-Fermi profile of a fast rotating Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the minimizers of a magnetic 2D non-linear Schr\"odinger energy functional in a quadratic trapping potential, describing a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive an effective Thomas-Fermi-like model in the rapidly rotating limit where the centrifugal force compensates the confinement, and available states are restricted to the lowest Landau level. The coupling constant of the effective Thomas-Fermi functional is linked to the emergence of vortex lattices (the Abrikosov problem). We define it via a low density expansion of the energy of the corresponding homogeneous gas in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new system of surface integral equations for Maxwell's transmission problem in three dimensions. This system has two remarkable features, both of which we prove. First, it is well-posed at all frequencies. Second, the underlying linear operator has a uniformly bounded inverse as the frequency approaches zero, ensuring that there is no low-frequency breakdown. The system is derived from a formulation we introduced in our previous work, which required additional integral constraints to ensure well -posedness across all frequencies. In this study, we eliminate those constraints and demonstrate that our new self adjoint, constraints-free linear system expressed in the desirable form of an identity plus a compact weakly-singular operator is stable for all frequencies. Furthermore, we propose and analyze a fully discrete numerical method for these systems and provide a proof of spectrally accurate convergence for the computational method. We also computationally demonstrate the high-order accuracy of the algorithm using benchmark scatterers with curved surfaces.</description>
