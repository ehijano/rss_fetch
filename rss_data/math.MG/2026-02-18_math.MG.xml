      <title>Chord Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper establishes a new family of analytic inequalities. Together with the fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren and Lieb, they form a complete class of analytic inequalities, referred to as the chord Sobolev inequalities. The paper also demonstrates the connection of all these inequalities to the chord isoperimetric inequalities in integral geometry. The limiting cases of the chord Sobolev inequalities are derived as well, one of which can be viewed as a logarithmic Sobolev-type inequality. These limiting cases, combined with the work of Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu, complete the theory of chord Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>On basic $r$-ball polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note introduces the class of basic $r$-ball polyhedra in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{d}$ for $d&gt;1$ and $r&gt;0$. We investigate their face structure and, for given integers $0\leq i\leq d-1$, $n\geq d+1\geq 3$ determine the maximal number of $i$-dimensional faces among all basic $r$-ball polyhedra in $\mathbb{E}^{d}$ with $n$ facets. In addition, we establish that for $d&gt;2$, every basic $r$-ball polyhedron is globally rigid with respect to its inner dihedral angles.</description>

      <title>From Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequalities to uniform contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we establish Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequalities for $r$-ball bodies. Building on these inequalities, we somewhat further extend earlier results on analogues of the Kneser--Poulsen conjecture concerning intersections of balls under uniform contractions in Euclidean $d$-space. As an immediate corollary, we obtain a proof of Alexander's conjecture for uniform contractions.</description>

      <title>Mazur-Ulam Theorem With Gromov-Hausdorff Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that two Banach spaces are linearly isometric if and only if the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between them is finite, in particular, zero. The proof is compilative and relies on results obtained by many researchers on the approximability of almost-surjective almost-isometries by linear surjective isometries. In the finite-dimensional case, previously obtained by I.~Mikhailov, a simpler proof under weaker assumptions is given. In the finite-dimensional case, a criterion for isometry in terms of finite (compact) subsets is also given.</description>

      <title>Urysohn Width and Surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of Urysohn width of manifolds under a connected sum operation, specifically, bounding widths of summands in terms of widths of the sum and vice versa. Our methods also apply to the universal covers of these spaces, and to more general type of surgeries. Lastly, we provide examples that show the optimality of constants in our estimates.</description>

      <title>Novel distance-based masking and adaptive alpha-shape methods for CNN-ready reconstruction of arbitrary 2D CFD flow domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpolating scattered CFD datasets onto a uniform Cartesian grid can distort the true geometry, producing a convex-hull type envelope and activating nonphysical regions. This work presents a reconstruction framework that recovers physically consistent masks before exporting CNN-ready fields. It introduces two novel strategies, distance-based masking and an adaptive alpha-shape formulation that normalizes alpha using local data resolution, and evaluates them against classical alpha-shape boundary recovery. A quantitative, topology-aware metric suite is introduced to assess retention, suppression of unsupported regions, overlap consistency, and connectivity. The novel distance-based method is robust across the geometries considered under the same threshold rule, with tau set to the minimum CFD grid spacing, and achieves 500-800 times speedups over classical alpha-shapes. The adaptive alpha-shape remains stable when its control parameter is set to 1 and is 1.7-2.6 times faster than the classical variant, which requires geometry-specific alpha tuning. A lightweight boundary inflation post-process using a minimal dilation further improves retention by up to 2.96% with negligible unsupported activation (less than 0.08%). Overall, the distance-based method is recommended as the default due to its accuracy, stability, minimal tuning, and low cost, while the adaptive alpha-shape is a strong alternative when grid-spacing information for threshold selection is unavailable. A companion web application operationalizes the workflow end to end, enabling 2D ASCII dataset upload, parameter tuning, mask and boundary generation, and export of CNN-ready outputs.</description>

      <title>Solving Dirichlet problem on unbounded uniform domains by using sphericalization techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the setting of metric spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, establishing existence of solutions to Dirichlet problem in a bounded domain in such a metric space is accomplished via direct methods of calculus of variation and the use of a Maz'ya type inequality, which is a consequence of the Poincar\'e inequality. However, when the domain and its boundary are unbounded, such a method is unavailable. In this paper, using the technique of sphericalization developed in the prior paper~[32], we establish the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded uniform domains with unbounded boundary when $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also explore the issue of whether such solutions are unique by considering $p$-parabolicity and $p$-hyperbolicity properties of the domain.</description>
