      <title>Heterogeneous Entity Representation for Medicinal Synergy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medicinal synergy prediction is a powerful tool in drug discovery and development that harnesses the principles of combination therapy to enhance therapeutic outcomes by improving efficacy, reducing toxicity, and preventing drug resistance. While a myriad of computational methods has emerged for predicting synergistic drug combinations, a large portion of them may overlook the intricate, yet critical relationships between various entities in drug interaction networks, such as drugs, cell lines, and diseases. These relationships are complex and multidimensional, requiring sophisticated modeling to capture nuanced interplay that can significantly influence therapeutic efficacy. We introduce a salient deep hypergraph learning method, namely, Heterogeneous Entity Representation for MEdicinal Synergy prediction (HERMES), to predict anti-cancer drug synergy. HERMES integrates heterogeneous data sources, encompassing drug, cell line, and disease information, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions involved. By leveraging advanced hypergraph neural networks with gated residual mechanisms, HERMES can effectively learn complex relationships/interactions within the data. Our results show HERMES demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, particularly in forecasting new drug combinations, significantly surpassing previous methods. This advancement underscores the potential of HERMES to facilitate more effective and precise drug combination predictions, thereby enhancing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Drift-Diffusion Model of Schachter-Singer's Two Factor Theory of Emotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference has been used in the past to model visual perception (Kersten, Mamassian, &amp; Yuille, 2004), accounting for the Helmholtz principle of perception as "unconscious inference" that is constrained by bottom-up sensory evidence (likelihood) while subject to top-down expectation, priming, or other contextual influences (prior bias); here "unconsciousness" merely relates to the "directness" of perception in the sense of Gibson. Here, we adopt the same Bayesian framework to model emotion process in accordance with Schachter-Singer's Two-Factor theory, which argues that emotion is the outcome of cognitive labeling or attribution of a diffuse pattern of autonomic arousal (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962). In analogous to visual perception, we conceptualize the emotion process as an instance of Bayesian inference, combining the contextual information with a person's physiological arousal patterns. Drift-diffusion models were constructed to simulate emotional processes, where the decision boundaries correspond to the emotional state experienced by the participants, and boundary-crossing constitutes "labeling" in Schachter-Singer's sense. Our model is tested against experimental data from the Schachter &amp; Singer's study (1962) and the Ross et al. study (1969). Two model scenarios are investigated, in which arousal pattern as one factor is pitted against contextual interaction with an confederate (in Schachter-Singer case) or explicitly instructed mis-attribution (in Ross et al. case) as another factor, mapping onto the Bayesian prior (initial position of the drift) and the likelihood function (evidence accumulation or drift rate). We find that the first scenario (arousal as the prior and context as the likelihood) has a better fit with Schachter &amp; Singer (1962) whereas the second scenario (context as the prior and arousal as the likelihood) has a better fit with Ross et al. (1969).</description>

      <title>A Mixed Tree-Cotree Gauge for the Reduced Basis Approximation of Maxwell's Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction methods are a powerful tool to drastically reduce the computational effort of problems which need to be evaluated repeatedly, i.e., when computing the same system for various parameter values. When applying a reduced basis approximation algorithm to the Maxwell eigenvalue problem, we encounter spurious solutions in the reduced system which hence need to be removed during the basis construction. In this paper, we discuss two tree-cotree gauge-based methods for the removal of the spurious eigenmodes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of water injection heat recovery potential of abandoned oil wells to geothermal wells in northern Shaanxi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chang 2 bottom water reservoir area in the western part of northern Shaanxi is one of the core oil-producing areas in the Ordos Basin.One of the main reservoirs is the Chang 2 reservoir of the Triassic Yanchang Formation, which has good physical conditions, active edge and bottom water, and high geothermal gradient. In this paper, the reservoir numerical simulation software CMG is used to simulate the water intake and heat recovery in the target study area, and the heat recovery rate and heat recovery of the three water production methods of direct water production, four injection and one production and one injection and four production under different injection pressures are analyzed. The results show that it is difficult to realize the direct water extraction from the bottom water reservoir. The annual heat recovery of single well of four injection and one production and one injection and four production is converted to the standard coal production between 190 ~ 420 t, so the Chang 2 reservoir in the western part of northern Shaanxi has the potential of water injection and heat recovery.</description>

      <title>Deep material networks for fiber suspensions with infinite material contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the laminate based framework of direct Deep Material Networks (DMNs) to treat suspensions of rigid fibers in a non-Newtonian solvent. To do so, we derive two-phase homogenization blocks that are capable of treating incompressible fluid phases and infinite material contrast. In particular, we leverage existing results for linear elastic laminates to identify closed form expressions for the linear homogenization functions of two-phase layered emulsions. To treat infinite material contrast, we rely on the repeated layering of two-phase layered emulsions in the form of coated layered materials. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure that the effective properties of coated layered materials with incompressible phases are non-singular, even if one of the phases is rigid. With the derived homogenization blocks and non-singularity conditions at hand, we present a novel DMN architecture, which we name the Flexible DMN (FDMN) architecture. We build and train FDMNs to predict the effective stress response of shear-thinning fiber suspensions with a Cross-type matrix material. For 31 fiber orientation states, six load cases, and over a wide range of shear rates relevant to engineering processes, the FDMNs achieve validation errors below 4.31% when compared to direct numerical simulations with Fast-Fourier-Transform based computational techniques. Compared to a conventional machine learning approach introduced previously by the consortium of authors, FDMNs offer better accuracy at an increased computational cost for the considered material and flow scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards commands recommender system in BIM authoring tool using transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of BIM software presents significant barriers to the widespread adoption of BIM and model-based design within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector. End-users frequently express concerns regarding the additional effort required to create a sufficiently detailed BIM model when compared with conventional 2D drafting. This study explores the potential of sequential recommendation systems to accelerate the BIM modeling process. By treating BIM software commands as recommendable items, we introduce a novel end-to-end approach that predicts the next-best command based on user historical interactions. Our framework extensively preprocesses real-world, large-scale BIM log data, utilizes the transformer architectures from the latest large language models as the backbone network, and ultimately results in a prototype that provides real-time command suggestions within the BIM authoring tool Vectorworks. Subsequent experiments validated that our proposed model outperforms the previous study, demonstrating the immense potential of the recommendation system in enhancing design efficiency.</description>

      <title>Large Reasoning Models for 3D Floorplanning in EDA: Learning from Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Dreamweaver, which belongs to a new class of auto-regressive decision-making models known as large reasoning models (LRMs). Dreamweaver is designed to improve 3D floorplanning in electronic design automation (EDA) via an architecture that melds advancements in sequence-to-sequence reinforcement learning algorithms. A significant advantage of our approach is its ability to effectively reason over large discrete action spaces, which is essential for handling the numerous potential positions for various functional blocks in floorplanning. Additionally, Dreamweaver demonstrates strong performance even when trained on entirely random trajectories, showcasing its capacity to leverage sub-optimal or non-expert trajectories to enhance its results. This innovative approach contributes to streamlining the integrated circuit (IC) design flow and reducing the high computational costs typically associated with floorplanning. We evaluate its performance against a current state-of-the-art method, highlighting notable improvements.</description>

      <title>LLMFactor: Extracting Profitable Factors through Prompts for Explainable Stock Movement Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, particularly in text analysis. However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs Sequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence stock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more directly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for complex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TorchOpera, a compound AI system for enhancing the safety and quality of prompts and responses for Large Language Models. TorchOpera ensures that all user prompts are safe, contextually grounded, and effectively processed, while enhancing LLM responses to be relevant and high quality. TorchOpera utilizes the vector database for contextual grounding, rule-based wrappers for flexible modifications, and specialized mechanisms for detecting and adjusting unsafe or incorrect content. We also provide a view of the compound AI system to reduce the computational cost. Extensive experiments show that TorchOpera ensures the safety, reliability, and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings while maintaining the efficiency of LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Towards augmented data quality management: Automation of Data Quality Rule Definition in Data Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the contemporary data-driven landscape, ensuring data quality (DQ) is crucial for deriving actionable insights from vast data repositories. The objective of this study is to explore the potential for automating data quality management within data warehouses as data repository commonly used by large organizations. By conducting a systematic review of existing DQ tools available in the market and academic literature, the study assesses their capability to automatically detect and enforce data quality rules. The review encompassed 151 tools from various sources, revealing that most current tools focus on data cleansing and fixing in domain-specific databases rather than data warehouses. Only a limited number of tools, specifically ten, demonstrated the capability to detect DQ rules, not to mention implementing this in data warehouses. The findings underscore a significant gap in the market and academic research regarding AI-augmented DQ rule detection in data warehouses. This paper advocates for further development in this area to enhance the efficiency of DQ management processes, reduce human workload, and lower costs. The study highlights the necessity of advanced tools for automated DQ rule detection, paving the way for improved practices in data quality management tailored to data warehouse environments. The study can guide organizations in selecting data quality tool that would meet their requirements most.</description>

      <title>Bloch sphere representation for Rabi oscillation driven by Rashba field in the two-dimensional harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the dynamical properties of Rabi oscillations driven by an alternating Rashba field applied to a two-dimensional (2D) harmonic confinement system. We solve the time-dependent (TD) Schr\"{o}dinger equation numerically and rewrite the resulting TD wavefunction onto the Bloch sphere (BS) using two BS parameters of the zenith ($\theta_B$) and azimuthal ($\phi_B$) angles, extracting the phase information $\phi_B$ as well as the mixing ratio $\theta_B$ between the two BS-pole states.
  We employed a two-state rotating wave (TSRW) approach and studied the fundamental features of $\theta_B$ and $\phi_B$ over time. The TSRW approach reveals a triangular wave formation in $\theta_B$. Moreover, at each apex of the triangular wave, the TD wavefunction passes through the BS pole, and the state is completely replaced by the opposite spin state. The TSRW approach also elucidates a linear change in $\phi_B$. The slope of $\phi_B$ vs. time is equal to the difference between the dynamical terms, leading to a confinement potential in the harmonic system. The TSRW approach further demonstrates a jump in the phase difference by $\pi$ when the wavefunction passes through the BS pole.
  The alternating Rashba field causes multiple successive Rabi transitions in the 2D harmonic system. We then introduce the effective BS (EBS) and transform these complicated transitions into an equivalent "single" Rabi one. Consequently, the EBS parameters $\theta_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\phi_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ exhibit mixing and phase difference between two spin states $\alpha$ and $\beta$, leading to a deep understanding of the TD features of multi-Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, the combination of the BS representation with the TSRW approach successfully reveals the dynamical properties of the Rabi oscillation, even beyond the TSRW approximation.</description>

      <title>Improving Quality Control of Whole Slide Images by Explicit Artifact Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of artifacts in whole slide image acquisition, prevalent in both clinical workflows and research-oriented settings, necessitates human intervention and re-scanning. Overcoming this challenge requires developing quality control algorithms, that are hindered by the limited availability of relevant annotated data in histopathology. The manual annotation of ground-truth for artifact detection methods is expensive and time-consuming. This work addresses the issue by proposing a method dedicated to augmenting whole slide images with artifacts. The tool seamlessly generates and blends artifacts from an external library to a given histopathology dataset. The augmented datasets are then utilized to train artifact classification methods. The evaluation shows their usefulness in classification of the artifacts, where they show an improvement from 0.10 to 0.01 AUROC depending on the artifact type. The framework, model, weights, and ground-truth annotations are freely released to facilitate open science and reproducible research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores reduced-order modeling for analyzing the time-dependent diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the finite element method. We employ proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. The reduced-order model performance is tested through a benchmark problem on hydrogel swelling and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Then, we embed the reduced-order model into an optimization loop to efficiently identify the coupled problem's material parameters using full-field data. Finally, a study is conducted on the uncertainty propagation of the material parameter.</description>
