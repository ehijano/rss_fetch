      <title>Engineering Supercomputing Platforms for Biomolecular Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.</description>

      <title>Algal Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly a decade ago it was discovered that the spherical cell body of the alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ can act as a lens to concentrate incoming light onto the cell's membrane-bound photoreceptor and thereby affect phototaxis. Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have complex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental, yet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by the bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such questions: the $absorption$ problem for $incoming$ light, typified by photosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and the $emission$ problem for $outgoing$ light, where the paradigm is bioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates. Here we examine both of these aspects of ``algal optics" in the special case where the absorption or emission is localized in structures that are small relative to the overall organism size, taking into account both refraction and reflections at the cell-water boundary. Analytical and numerical results are developed for the distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we establish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing problems. For strongly non-spherical shapes we find lensing effects that may have implications for photosynthetic activity and for the angular distribution of light emitted during bioluminescent flashes.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>
