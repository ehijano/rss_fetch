      <title>A low-cost, open-source maskless photolithography stepper for microfabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photolithography is a key part of modern semiconductor process flows, and photolithography steppers have been used for decades to achieve precise patterning for device fabrication. However, these tools are often large and expensive, which restricts their use to industry and well-funded university laboratories. In this paper, we propose a $3000 maskless photolithography stepper that is affordable, open-source, and easy to assemble. The stepper, which uses a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector as its optical engine, is able to achieve an optical resolution of under 2 microns. The stepper also features a motorized micropositioning system, which is able to align features with single-digit micron precision. A deep learning computer vision model is also used to achieve fine-grain alignment of patterns on a chip. These capabilities allow for the use of the stepper for microfabrication to produce micron-scale devices such as NMOS transistors.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Performance of FBK VUV-HD3 and HPK VUV4 SiPMs in the LoLX Liquid Xenon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a critical technology for the next generation of rare-event search experiments using liquid xenon (LXe). While two VUV-sensitive SiPMs are available, comprehensive in-situ studies are needed to inform detector design and compare device response. This work presents a direct comparison of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD3 and Hamamatsu (HPK) VUV4 SiPMs operated simultaneously within the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) detector. Using data collected with gamma sources placed outside the detector, we characterized the relative performance of these photosensors. Our analysis reveals that under these operating conditions, the HPK SiPMs are 33-38% less efficient than the FBK devices, a larger difference than predicted by standard PDE models in vacuum measurement. We show that this discrepancy is resolved by our angular and wavelength dependent PDE model incorporating surface shadowing effects into our optical simulation, which then accurately reproduces the experimental data. This finding has significant implications for the selection and implementation of photosensors in future large-scale LXe detectors.</description>

      <title>Nano-electronvolt Fourier-limited transition of a single surface-adsorbed molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy allows one to probe weak interactions and to detect subtle phenomena. While such measurements are routinely performed on atoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on surfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of surface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where the transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In this work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on Fourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed onto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and super-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on various properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the way for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and spectral resolution can be combined.</description>

      <title>3D-Structured Polyethylene Windows for Low-Loss Transmission in Wideband Cryogenic Terahertz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of a broadband vacuum window and infrared filter based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for millimeter wave receivers operating across ALMA Band 6 and 7 (211-373 GHz). The window incorporates pyramidal anti-reflection (AR) structures, machined directly into the polyethylene using CNC machining, which provide impedance matching over a broad frequency range. The structured UHMWPE method was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a cryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides mechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We characterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\%$ across the full band. Complementary heterodyne measurements confirm improved receiver noise performance. These results establish 3D structured UHMWPE as a promising platform for broadband cryogenic optics in high-sensitivity THz instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a versatile approach to 4D-STEM precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our MAPED approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.</description>

      <title>Comparative Simulation of CEvNS Recoil Observables in Geant4 Using Germanium, Argon, and Xenon Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Geant4-based simulation study of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) for three commonly used detector targets: Germanium, Argon, and Xenon. A custom CEvNS model was implemented, including differential cross sections and Helm form factors. Recoil energy spectra, angular distributions, and form factor effects were analyzed using ROOT. The results reveal expected trends: heavier nuclei lead to lower recoil energies and increased form factor suppression. This work provides a simulation framework to support future theoretical and experimental studies in neutrino physics and dark matter searches.</description>
