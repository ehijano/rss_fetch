      <title>Wave Function Realism and the Mathematization of Nature. A Phenomenological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to "read off" metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world "minus observers," mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.</description>

      <title>Looking for Work in Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On Causality and Predictivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain approaches to quantum gravity, such as the one based on the concept of purely virtual particles (fakeons), sacrifice the cause-effect relation at very small scales to reconcile renormalizability with unitarity. Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly "disruptors", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Mati\`ere noire et (ou) gravitation modifi\'ee : une approche historique et \'epist\'emologique</title>

Abstract: The current standard model of cosmology assumes that the majority of matter in the Universe is made of dark matter, and that the latter is fundamentally different from ordinary matter. Dark matter can in principle explain the rotation of galaxies, the gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters or the appearance of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the Universe. But does dark matter really exist? Here, we review the history of this concept and its implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. We also consider the questions that remain, the limitations of the model, and present alternative theories, in particular modifications to the gravitional law that would -- perhaps -- make it possible to do without it.</description>

      <title>Quantum model for black holes and clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $\Xi$ and $\Gamma$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\Xi$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\Gamma$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\Xi$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\Xi$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\Gamma$ and $\Xi$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\Xi$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</description>

      <title>Heat as a gauge connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that heat defines a gauge connection on a line bundle over work configurations. Vanishing curvature is equivalent to the local existence of entropy and temperature functions such that heat can be expressed as $TdS$. A conjecture of Jauch, that entropy and temperature arise from a conservation law, is shown to follow as a special case. Global equilibrium may nevertheless fail in the presence of a thermal analogue of geometric phase.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>
