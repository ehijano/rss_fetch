      <title>RTD-Conjecture and Concept Classes Induced by Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured that the recursive teaching dimension of any finite concept class is upper-bounded by the VC-dimension of this class times a universal constant. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for two rich families of concept classes where each class is induced by some graph $G$. For each $G$, we consider the class whose concepts represent stars in $G$ as well as the class whose concepts represent connected sets in $G$. We show that, for concept classes of this kind, the recursive teaching dimension either equals the VC-dimension or is less by $1$.</description>

      <title>Orthology and Near-Cographs in the Context of Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthologous genes, which arise through speciation, play a key role in comparative genomics and functional inference. In particular, graph-based methods allow for the inference of orthology estimates without prior knowledge of the underlying gene or species trees. This results in orthology graphs, where each vertex represents a gene, and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding genes are estimated to be orthologs. Orthology graphs inferred under a tree-like evolutionary model must be cographs. However, real-world data often deviate from this property, either due to noise in the data, errors in inference methods or, simply, because evolution follows a network-like rather than a tree-like process. The latter, in particular, raises the question of whether and how orthology graphs can be derived from or, equivalently, are explained by phylogenetic networks. Here, we study the constraints imposed on orthology graphs when the underlying evolutionary history follows a phylogenetic network instead of a tree. We show that any orthology graph can be represented by a sufficiently complex level-k network. However, such networks lack biologically meaningful constraints. In contrast, level-1 networks provide a simpler explanation, and we establish characterizations for level-1 explainable orthology graphs, i.e., those derived from level-1 evolutionary histories. To this end, we employ modular decomposition, a classical technique for studying graph structures. Specifically, an arbitrary graph is level-1 explainable if and only if each primitive subgraph is a near-cograph (a graph in which the removal of a single vertex results in a cograph). Additionally, we present a linear-time algorithm to recognize level-1 explainable orthology graphs and to construct a level-1 network that explains them, if such a network exists.</description>

      <title>The Planted Spanning Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of detecting and recovering a planted spanning tree $M_n^*$ hidden within a complete, randomly weighted graph $G_n$. Specifically, each edge $e$ has a non-negative weight drawn independently from $P_n$ if $e \in M_n^*$ and from $Q_n$ otherwise, where $P_n \equiv P$ is fixed and $Q_n$ scales with $n$ such that its density at the origin satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} n Q'_n(0)=1.$ We consider two representative cases: when $M_n^*$ is either a uniform spanning tree or a uniform Hamiltonian path. We analyze the recovery performance of the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm and derive a fixed-point equation that characterizes the asymptotic fraction of edges in $M_n^*$ successfully recovered by the MST as $n \to \infty.$ Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic mean weight of the MST, extending Frieze's $\zeta(3)$ result to the planted model. Leveraging this result, we design an efficient test based on the MST weight and show that it can distinguish the planted model from the unplanted model with vanishing testing error as $n \to \infty.$ Our analysis relies on an asymptotic characterization of the local structure of the planted model, employing the framework of local weak convergence.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning via $p$-Conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs in the regime where data labels are scarce or possibly corrupted. We propose an approach called $p$-conductance learning that generalizes the $p$-Laplace and Poisson learning methods by introducing an objective reminiscent of $p$-Laplacian regularization and an affine relaxation of the label constraints. This leads to a family of probability measure mincut programs that balance sparse edge removal with accurate distribution separation. Our theoretical analysis connects these programs to well-known variational and probabilistic problems on graphs (including randomized cuts, effective resistance, and Wasserstein distance) and provides motivation for robustness when labels are diffused via the heat kernel. Computationally, we develop a semismooth Newton-conjugate gradient algorithm and extend it to incorporate class-size estimates when converting the continuous solutions into label assignments. Empirical results on computer vision and citation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in low label-rate, corrupted-label, and partial-label regimes.</description>

      <title>Graphical Conditions for the Existence, Unicity and Number of Regular Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regular models of a normal logic program are a particular type of partial (i.e. 3-valued) models which correspond to stable partial models with minimal undefinedness. In this paper, we explore graphical conditions on the dependency graph of a finite ground normal logic program to analyze the existence, unicity and number of regular models for the program. We show three main results: 1) a necessary condition for the existence of non-trivial (i.e. non-2-valued) regular models, 2) a sufficient condition for the unicity of regular models, and 3) two upper bounds for the number of regular models based on positive feedback vertex sets. The first two conditions generalize the finite cases of the two existing results obtained by You and Yuan (1994) for normal logic programs with well-founded stratification. The third result is also new to the best of our knowledge. Key to our proofs is a connection that we establish between finite ground normal logic programs and Boolean network theory.</description>

      <title>Depth-Bounds for Neural Networks via the Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.</description>

      <title>Forward-backward Contention Resolution Schemes for Fair Rationing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use contention resolution schemes (CRS) to derive algorithms for the fair rationing of a single resource when agents have stochastic demands. We aim to provide ex-ante guarantees on the level of service provided to each agent, who may measure service in different ways (Type-I, II, or III), calling for CRS under different feasibility constraints (rank-1 matroid or knapsack). We are particularly interested in two-order CRS where the agents are equally likely to arrive in a known forward order or its reverse, which is motivated by online rationing at food banks.
  In particular, we derive a two-order CRS for rank-1 matroids with guarantee $1/(1+e^{-1/2})\approx 0.622$, which we prove is tight. This improves upon the $1/2$ guarantee that is best-possible under a single order (Alaei, SIAM J. Comput. 2014), while achieving separation with the $1-1/e\approx 0.632$ guarantee that is possible for random-order CRS (Lee and Singla, ESA 2018). Because CRS guarantees imply prophet inequalities, this also beats the two-order prophet inequality with ratio $(\sqrt{5}-1)/2\approx 0.618$ from (Arsenis, SODA 2021), which was tight for single-threshold policies. Rank-1 matroids suffice to provide guarantees under Type-II or III service, but Type-I service requires knapsack. Accordingly, we derive a two-order CRS for knapsack with guarantee $1/3$, improving upon the $1/(3+e^{-2})\approx 0.319$ guarantee that is best-possible under a single order (Jiang et al., SODA 2022). To our knowledge, $1/3$ provides the best-known guarantee for knapsack CRS even in the offline setting. Finally, we provide an upper bound of $1/(2+e^{-1})\approx 0.422$ for two-order knapsack CRS, strictly smaller than the upper bound of $(1-e^{-2})/2\approx0.432$ for random-order knapsack CRS.</description>

      <title>On Distance Preserving and Sequentially Distance Preserving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.06404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an \emph{isometric} subgraph of $G$ if $d_H(u,v)= d_G(u,v)$, for every pair~$u,v\in V(H)$. A graph is \emph{distance preserving} if it has an isometric subgraph of every possible order. A graph is \emph{sequentially distance preserving} if its vertices can be ordered such that deleting the first $i$ vertices results in an isometric subgraph, for all $i\ge1$. We give an equivalent condition to sequentially distance preserving based upon simplicial orderings. Using this condition, we prove that if a graph does not contain any induced cycles of length~$5$ or greater, then it is sequentially distance preserving and thus distance preserving. Next we consider the distance preserving property on graphs with a cut vertex. Finally, we define a family of non-distance preserving graphs constructed from cycles.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of minimal dendric shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dendric shifts are defined by combinatorial restrictions of the extensions of the words in their languages. This family generalizes well-known families of shifts such as Sturmian shifts, Arnoux-Rauzy shifts and codings of interval exchange transformations. It is known that any minimal dendric shift has a primitive $\mathcal{S}$-adic representation where the morphisms in $\mathcal{S}$ are positive tame automorphisms of the free group generated by the alphabet. In this paper we give an $\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of this family by means of two finite graphs. As an application, we are able to decide whether a shift space generated by a uniformly recurrent morphic word is (eventually) dendric.</description>
