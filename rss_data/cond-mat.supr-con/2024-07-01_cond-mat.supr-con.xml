      <title>Superconducting properties of eutectic high-entropy alloy superconductor NbScTiZr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of annealing on the superconducting properties of eutectic high-entropy alloy NbScTiZr was examined by measuring magnetization, electrical resistivity, and zero-field specific heat. Additionally, the extent of lattice strain was assessed via the analysis of lattice parameters and Vickers microhardness. The greatest lattice strain was inferred in the sample annealed at 400 $^{\circ}$C. Field-dependent magnetization datasets indicate enhanced flux pinning in the as-cast, 400 $^{\circ}$C annealed, and 600 $^{\circ}$C annealed samples. The superconducting parameters such as upper critical field, Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, and magnetic penetration depth do not strongly depend on the annealing temperature. However, the Maki parameter shows a peak at 400 $^{\circ}$C annealing temperature and correlates with the magnitude of lattice strain. This suggests that greater lattice strain may enhance the Maki parameter by altering the orbital-limited field through the modification of flux pinning strength. Although the influence of lattice strain is less discernible in zero-field specific heat measurements, the superconducting parameters deduced from specific heat data suggest a potential for strong-coupled superconductivity in samples heat-treated above 600 $^{\circ}$C. Our investigation underscores the substantial impact of lattice strain on the Maki parameter of eutectic HEA superconductors, primarily through the modulation of flux pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Chiral Current Inversion Induced by Flat-Band Andreev Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spontaneous chiral surface current circulating in a three-dimensional disk of a chiral superconductor (SC) utilizing the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory. We obtain spatial profiles of the chiral current for both a ($d_{zx} + i d_{yz}$)-wave and a ($p_{x} + i p_{y}$)-wave SCs (where the top and bottom surfaces of the disk are perpendicular to the $z$-axis). Whereas the chiral current for a ($p_{x} + i p_{y}$)-wave SC does not depend on $z$, a reversal of the chiral current takes place at the top and bottom surfaces in the case of a ($d_{zx} + i d_{yz}$)-wave SC. In this latter case, flat-band Andreev bound states appear at the top and bottom surfaces in addition to the chiral surface states at the lateral surface. The chiral current reversal is explained in terms of hybridization between the two types of Andreev bound states. As a result, the magnetic field around the disk differs drastically between the two cases.</description>

      <title>Numerical saddle point finding for diffusive superconductor actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a numerical approach to modeling magnetoelectric effects generated by spin-orbit coupling in inhomogeneous diffusive 2D superconductors. It is based on direct minimization of the free energy of diffusion modes, including their coupling to the spin-orbit field strength, described by a recently discovered $\sigma$-model action. We explain how to retain exact conservation laws in the the discretized model, and detail the numerical procedure. We apply the approach to the spin-galvanic and the inverse spin-galvanic effects in finite-size 2D superconductors, and describe short-range oscillations of circulating currents and spin densities originating from the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>The hybrid Josephson rhombus: A superconducting element with tailored current-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>
