      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a $SO(3)$ non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D with quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this work, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

      <title>NLO in the large charge sector of the critical $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading correction to the scaling dimension of large-charge operators in the $3d$ critical $O(N)$ model in a double scaling limit in which both $N$ and the operator charge $Q$ are taken to be large. When $Q \gg N$ our result matches predictions from the conformal superfluid EFT and allows to extract next-to-leading order corrections to the EFT Wilsonian coefficients. At present, our result represents the most precise determination of large-charge operator scaling dimension in weakly-coupled CFTs.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulations and extraction of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations are crucial for the phenomenological extraction and separation of various generalized parton distributions. We provide a new choice of frame and corresponding formalism to describe the azimuthal distributions, based on the separation of physics occurring at different momentum scales. We demonstrate that this new description is not only well-suited for experimental analysis, but also advantageous in separating contributions from different subprocesses to the same physical cross section.</description>

      <title>Mixing between flavor singlets in lattice gauge theories coupled to matter fields in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first extensive, numerical study of the non-trivial problem of mixing between flavor-singlet composite states emerging in strongly coupled lattice field theories with matter field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations of the gauge group. The theory of interest is the minimal candidate for a composite Higgs model that also accommodates a mechanism for top partial compositeness: the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two (Dirac) fermions transforming as the fundamental and three as the two-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, respectively. We apply an admixture of APE and Wuppertal smearings, as well as the generalized eigenvalue problem approach, to two-point functions involving flavor-singlet mesons, for ensembles having time extent longer than the space extent. We demonstrate that, in the region of lattice parameter space accessible to this study, both masses and mixing angles can be measured effectively, despite the presence of (numerically noisy) contributions from disconnected diagrams.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Formulation of Compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics of anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>
