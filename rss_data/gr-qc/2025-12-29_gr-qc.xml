      <title>Acceleration Radiation of Freely Falling Atoms in Bardeen Regular Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <title>GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for inference of gravitational-wave time series, which relies on an Inception-inspired multi-scale convolutional feature extractor combined with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. GraviBERT is trained in two stages: a BERT-style pretraining phase, in which the model learns to predict masked segments in feature space to capture universal patterns and physics, followed by supervised fine-tuning for accurate parameter estimation. This approach demonstrates impressive improvement across multiple metrics compared to training from scratch. On in-domain data, it reduces the mean absolute error for point-estimate parameter inference by up to $30\%$, and training convergence accelerates by up to a factor of six. Moreover, at low signal-to-noise ratio, the mean relative precision of the inferred masses and distances reaches the few-percent level, while the mean absolute error in the effective spin is about $10^{-3}$. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model demonstrates remarkable efficiency, converging up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reducing estimation errors by up to approximately $45\%$, indicating that it learns sufficient detector-agnostic representations. Cross-approximant transfer demonstrates comparable performance, achieving up to $44\%$ reductions in mean absolute error across all parameters and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding 0.9 for mass parameters at signal-to-noise ratio 10, compared to 0.74 - 0.87 when training from scratch. Notably, GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms. The final regression head of the model can be adapted for a range of downstream tasks after pretraining, positioning it as a step towards foundation-style models in gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Physics in 2025: Status, Decisive Targets, and Path Forward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental physics today is best defined operationally: it is the program of identifying the microscopic degrees of freedom, symmetries, and dynamical laws that (i) reproduce the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, General Relativity (GR), and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model in their regimes of validity, and (ii) explain the observed phenomena that these baseline theories do not account for (dark matter, neutrino masses, baryogenesis, dark energy), while resolving conceptual inconsistencies (quantum gravity, naturalness, the cosmological constant problem, the measurement problem in quantum theory, information in black holes) and providing predictive unification. This review first lays out the SM+GR+$\Lambda$CDM baseline, the best current evidence for its parameters, and the concrete anomalies and missing ingredients. It then surveys the most relevant theoretical directions (effective field theories; amplitude/positivity programs; lattice and many-body methods; symmetry-based model building; cosmological EFTs; quantum information approaches to QFT/gravitation) and the experimental/observational landscape, including ground and space platforms, astronomical messengers, and in-situ tests. Throughout we emphasize: (a) how each observable maps to energy scales and couplings; (b) the dominant statistical and systematic limitations; (c) the sensitivity required for decisive progress. A staged roadmap is given only after the technical review, organized by decision points and cross-checks rather than by specific projects.</description>

      <title>Is energy conserved in general relativity ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short report is dedicated to the 40th anniversary of International Journal of Modern Physics A (IJMPA) and Modern Physics Letters A (MPLA). While the report is based on a series of papers[1-8], its content reflects my personal viewpoints. Therefore I am solely responsible for all the statements in the report. In this report we discuss conservation of energies in a curved spacetime including general relativity. We argue that the matter energy is not necessarily conserved in a curved space time due to a lack of time translational invariance, and adding energy of gravitational fields to recover the conservation law of energies fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem. We show that there exists conserved quantities associated with the matter</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for Constrained Path Integrals in Minisuperspace Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed evaluation of constrained minisuperspace path integrals in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and in biaxial Bianchi IX quantum cosmology, employing the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute the relevant functional determinants. In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(\phi)=m^{2}\phi^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Analytical Forms and Degeneracy of Quasinormal Modes for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes for massless spin particles using the unified equation. We derive analytical expressions for both the quasinormal mode frequencies and the radial wave functions. The frequencies are determined exclusively by the black hole parameters and the quantum numbers $n$ and $m$, while the radial wave functions also depend on the quantum number $k$, indicating a degeneracy in frequency. For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties. This implies that, through the observation of quasinormal modes, one can not only determine the black hole's parameters but also observe the phenomenon in which one type of particle reproduces the quasinormal mode of another. Our work thus provides a theoretical foundation for understanding this mimicking behavior as well.</description>

      <title>Scattering of massless waves with arbitrary spin: a unified analysis for Schwarzschild-type medium black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified equation is employed to analytically investigate the scattering of massless spin particles by a Schwarzschild-type medium black hole. It is found that for spin particles, curved spacetime induces an effective complex potential analogous to a Coulomb field. While the real part of this potential contributes a real logarithmic term to the phase, the imaginary part gives rise to a corresponding imaginary logarithmic term. Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure. Insights gained from these experiments could, in turn, shed light on the scattering of other massless fields (e.g., gravitational waves) by actual black holes.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals I: Statistics Based on Time-Frequency Signal Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\Sigma$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.</description>

      <title>Methods for Detecting Gravitational Waves from mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals II: A Spectral-Leakage-Aware Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\Sigma$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\Sigma R$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Impact of neglecting center-of-mass acceleration in parameter estimation of stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $\alpha$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $\alpha = 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Role of Bag Constant and Modified Theory on Anisotropic Stellar Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are devoted to discuss different compact stars admitting anisotropic interiors in a particular modified theory of gravity. For this purpose, a spherically symmetric metric is adopted to formulate the field equations corresponding to two different $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ models, where $\mathcal{Q}=\mathcal{R}_{\alpha\gamma}\mathcal{T}^{\alpha\gamma}$. Since the field equations contain extra degrees of freedom, we choose Finch-Skea metric and MIT bag model equation of state to make them solvable. We also use matching conditions to calculate a constant triplet in the chosen ansatz. The resulting solutions are then graphically analyzed for particular values of the bag constant and model parameter in the interior of 4U 1820-30 compact star. The viability and stability of the modified models are also checked through certain tests. Further, we calculate the values of model parameter through the vanishing radial pressure constraint that correspond to the observed data (radii and masses) of eight different star candidates. Finally, we conclude that our models I and II are in well-agreement with the conditions needed for physically relevant interiors to exist.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands and Thermodynamics of the Black Hole in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic properties and the entanglement island of a black hole in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, analyzing key thermodynamic quantities such as the Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy, as well as the mass-horizon radius relation. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of black hole event horizon births: a contact geometry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result by Penrose establishes that null geodesics generating a black hole event horizon can only intersect at their entrance to the horizon in ``crossover'' points. This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called "crease set". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux &amp; Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux &amp; Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.</description>

      <title>Mass-to-Horizon Entropic Cosmology: A Unified Thermodynamic Pathway to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational tests of generalized mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology by incorporating large-scale structure growth data in addition to purely geometric probes. The theoretical framework is constructed from a generalized mass-to-horizon scaling relation, $M \propto L^n$, which implies a corresponding generalized entropic functional $S_n \propto L^{n+1}$. Within this setting, cosmic acceleration arises as an emergent phenomenon driven by an entropic force acting on the cosmological horizon. While earlier studies demonstrated that these entropic cosmologies can reproduce the background expansion history of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, here we present a comprehensive observational analysis that jointly employs Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova data with SH0ES calibration, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, and a suite of cosmological structure growth observations. A Bayesian model comparison indicates that the entropic models are statistically preferred over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM scenario, thereby providing strong support for an entropic origin of the observed late-time cosmic acceleration in place of a fundamental cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic counterparts of massive BH mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.</description>

      <title>Detection of Lensed Gravitational Waves in the Millihertz Band Using Frequency-Domain Lensing Feature Extraction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe lensed GW events, offering new opportunities for cosmology and fundamental physics. In the millihertz frequency band, the GW wavelength is often comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of the lens, where wave-optics effects are significant. Although traditional matched filtering is effective, the intense computational resources required motivate the search for more efficient alternatives to accelerate candidate event screening. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a Dual-Channel Lensing feature extraction eXtended Long Short-Term Memory Network (DCL-xLSTM). Unlike conventional recurrent architectures, DCL-xLSTM employs a matrix-valued memory structure and a memory-mixing mechanism to effectively capture amplitude diffraction patterns that span the entire millihertz frequency band. Trained on data generated by Point Mass (PM) and Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) models accounting for the transition from wave-optics to geometric-optics, the proposed method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.99, maintaining a true positive rate (TPR) above 98% at a false positive rate (FPR) below 1%. The network is robust against variations in signal-to-noise ratio, lens type, and lens mass, establishing its viability as a high-efficiency tool for future space-based GW detection.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Weak Lensing Surveys to Gravitational Waves from Inspiraling Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of upcoming and idealized weak lensing surveys to gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the nanohertz to microhertz frequency band. This range, situated between the reach of pulsar timing arrays and space-based interferometers, remains observationally underexplored. Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap. Our analysis highlights the potential and limitations of weak-lensing surveys for low-frequency GW astronomy, with angular resolution emerging as the dominant constraint.</description>

      <title>On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</description>

      <title>Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Padmanabhan Holographic Model in a BIonic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Padmanabhan has argued that a difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and the number in a bulk causes the expansion of the universe. We can reconsider this idea in a BIon system. A Bion is formed from two branes that are connected by a wormhole. Our universe may live on one of these branes. Each brane could be formed by joining lower-dimensional branes, such as $D_1$ ones. By joining $D_1$ branes, a $D_n$ brane is formed, and some amounts of energy are released. Then, perhaps some dimensions are compacted, and a certain amount of energy is released. These energies cause a significant difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk of branes. This causes the evolution of the universe and many changes in thermodynamic parameters, such as entropy, as well as cosmic parameters, including the Hubble constant. We obtain the standard form of the Hubble parameter and its dependency on redshift in a Bion system.</description>

      <title>Bulk-cone singularities and echoes from AdS exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The region near a black hole horizon may be modified by quantum gravity effects that resolve the singularity. Such geometry may be represented by an exotic compact object. Because the horizon is enclosed by a photon sphere, it is difficult to probe this region directly. In this paper, we develop a method to study the region inside the photon sphere by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence. We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole. We compute the corresponding bulk wave functions both via the WKB approximation and through numerical analysis and observe the bulk-cone singularities and echoes explicitly.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact duality between the extended thermodynamics of five-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes and the thermodynamic framework of the dual boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The thermodynamics of the dual CFT involves two central charges originating from the trace anomaly. We demonstrate a precise correspondence between the extended first laws on the bulk and boundary sides. Moreover, the topological charges of the CFT thermodynamics, associated with the phase transition and critical point, coincide with those of the corresponding bulk black hole.</description>

      <title>Particle production and Higgs reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves and its 3D topographic effect using the spectral-element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been regarded as a natural Weber bar capable of amplifying gravitational waves (GWs) for detecting events across a wide range of frequencies. However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections.</description>

      <title>Golden and Silver Dark Sirens for precise H0 measurement with HETDEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences are standard sirens that provide a direct measure of the source's luminosity distance, enabling an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). While a bright siren -- a GW event with an identified electromagnetic (EM) counterpart -- provided the first such constraint, most detections, currently dominated by black hole mergers, lack EM signatures. A measurement of H0 is still possible with these dark sirens by statistically associating GW events with galaxies in existing catalogs based on the sky localization. In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z &lt; 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the partition function associated with the democratic formulation of M-theory, focusing on its global definition and quantization properties. Using a path integral representation that makes manifest the underlying cohomological structure, we analyze the coupled system of form fields $C_4$ and $C_7$ and its associated gauge transformations. We show that the resulting description is naturally captured by a non-linear differential cocycle, reflecting the presence of a quadratic coupling between electric and magnetic degrees of freedom. This framework provides a transparent characterization of the global structure of the theory, clarifies the role of higher-form gauge symmetry, and allows for a consistent definition of the partition function in terms of higher-dimensional auxiliary manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars such as pulsars and magnetars lose angular momentum primarily through electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, $r$-mode oscillation, and also affected by fallback accretion processes. However, anomalous spin variations, particularly sudden enhanced spin-down rates, indicate additional spin-down mechanisms. We propose superradiant spin-down as a potential explanation for these events. By modelling the interplay between conventional and superradiant spin-down channels, we evaluate their impact on neutron star rotational evolution. We also discuss gravitational-wave emission produced by quadrupole deformation, $r$-mode oscillations, and axion-induced bosonic clouds around an isolated neutron star, highlighting their potential as distinct multimessenger probes in upcoming detectors.</description>

Abstract: Auxiliary field techniques have recently gained interest in four-dimensional non-linear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable sigma models. In these settings, coupling a suitable ``seed'' theory to auxiliary fields provides a powerful mechanism to generate infinite families of models while preserving key dynamical properties, such as electromagnetic duality invariance in four dimensions and classical integrability in two dimensions. Deformations induced through auxiliary fields are closely related to $T\bar{T}$-like deformations and, in two dimensions, also to their higher-spin generalisations. In this paper, we analyse and clarify the relations between different auxiliary field formulations in two and four dimensions, showing how they are governed by Legendre transformations of the interaction functions combined with appropriate field redefinitions. In four-dimensional electrodynamics, we establish a correspondence between the auxiliary field model of Russo and Townsend and the Ivanov--Zupnik formalism. In two dimensions, we develop the analogue of the Ivanov--Zupnik $\mu$-frame to deform Principal Chiral, symmetric-space, non-Abelian T-dual, and (bi-)Yang-Baxter sigma models. We discuss how integrability is preserved and use properties of the $\mu$-frame to further extend known families of integrable deformations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Eccentricity of Binary Black Holes from Spin-Orbit Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity remains one of the least accessible parameters in observations of binary black hole (BBH) systems, largely erased by gravitational radiation long before detection. We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes. Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data II: collider templates and Modal analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures of massive particles during inflation are highly informative targets for cosmological experiments. With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35\sigma$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation.</description>

Abstract: Via constructing an explicit Lagrangian for which the perturbation equations are analogues of a scalar field propagating in a planar black hole space-time, it is found that all planar black holes conformal to a Painlev\'e--Gullstrand type line element can be realized as analogue metrics. We also introduce the concept of holographic entanglement entropy for planar black-hole space-times. This is valid for an arbitrary choice of conformal and blackening factor, thereby vastly extending the number of known examples of explicitly known analogue metrics.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>

      <title>Test fields and naked singularities: is the second law the cosmic censor?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been claimed that a Kerr-Newman black hole can generically be overspun by neutral test fields, and it has been argued that even when backreactions are taken into account, the black hole can still be destroyed. In this paper, we revisit the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for a Kerr-Newman black hole with a test scalar field and a neutrino field, and point out that the assumption in previous work regarding the energy and angular momentum of the test fields absorbed by the black hole violates the second law of black hole thermodynamics. By solving the test scalar field and neutrino field near the event horizon explicitly, we demonstrate that an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole cannot be overspun by a test scalar field but can be destroyed by a neutrino field. Our results indicate that the condition required to overspin an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole coincides with the condition needed to violate the second law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we observe that such a violation of the second law might inevitably result in a breakdown of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Quantum effects in the era of reheating of the universe after inflation are considered. A semiclassical approach to gravity theory is applied within Starobinsky's inflationary model with backreaction. Some subtleties associated with accounting for quantum effects in the one-loop approximation are clarified. An estimate of the contribution of vacuum polarization in the stress-energy tensor of matter fields to the cosmological particle creation due to the scalaron decay is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics is a crucial and foundational aspect of black hole physics, yet its observational verification remains exceptionally challenging. The photon sphere of a black hole, a manifestation of strong gravitational effects, is intrinsically linked to its shadow, which has been directly captured through observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope. Investigating black hole thermodynamics from a gravitational perspective presents an intriguing avenue for research. This paper obtains an analytical formula for the coexistence curve and investigates the relationship between the thermodynamic phase transition and the photon sphere of a black hole with quantum anomaly. It proposes that the photon sphere encodes information about the black hole phase transition, arguing that the change in the photon sphere radius can serve as an order parameter characterizing the black hole's phase transition.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of quantum-corrected RN blackhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the observational signatures of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr"om (RN) black hole to constrain Planck-scale modifications to spacetime geometry using current astrophysical data. By analyzing the null geodesic structure, we demonstrate that the quantum correction parameter, $\mathrm{a}$, acts as a repulsive geometric potential that opposes the gravitational compactification induced by the electric charge, $Q$. This competition leads to a parameter degeneracy wherein a highly charged, quantum-corrected black hole can mimic the shadow size of a classical Schwarzschild black hole. To resolve this, we employ the strong-field limit formalism to derive the deflection angle and the observables associated with relativistic Einstein rings. Our analysis reveals that while the electric charge enhances the deflection angle, the quantum correction suppresses it, providing a theoretical mechanism to distinguish the two effects. Confronting these predictions with the latest Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, we derive robust constraints on the dimensionless parameter $\Pi = \mathrm{a}/Q$. We find that consistency with the shadow angular diameter of Sgr A* requires $0 \le \Pi \lesssim 0.7$, implying that quantum geometric corrections cannot exceed approximately $70\%$ of the black hole charge without violating empirical bounds. These results highlight the potential of strong-field lensing to place precise phenomenological limits on quantum gravity candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17957v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a one-component time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved space-time solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski space-time exists. However, it is surprising that non-trivial solutions can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\), is satisfied. We argue that naturally these solutions are not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown \emph{fine-tuning} mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, the naked singularities and the photon sphere of these novel but peculiar solutions are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-d E/d V$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$. In this case, if $\alpha&gt;0$, the effective pressure is always negative, but if $\alpha&lt;0$, it is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes surrounded by skewed dark matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Primary hairs may create echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most scenarios studied so far, the appearance of echoes in the ringdown signal requires modifications external to the black hole itself, such as the presence of matter in the near-horizon region, quantum field clouds, or exotic compact objects like wormholes that effectively introduce additional peaks in the effective potential. In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise in a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet hair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in such a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes without invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics. Using both the higher-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test fields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel mechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the ringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simplify the gravitational equations which apply in accelerating spacetimes and are consistent with the cosmological principle. Solutions to these equations should be tantamount to all order re-summations of the perturbative leading logarithms. We discuss the null hypothesis and we study the local expansion rate observable.</description>

      <title>Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static, spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate "clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Birefringence in a de Sitter Background with Chern-Simons Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Penrose Inequality: Conditional Results for Stable MOTS and General Trapped Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves the Spacetime Penrose Inequality, which relates the total mass of a spacetime to the area of black hole horizons. The inequality states that the mass of a spacetime must be at least as large as a quantity determined by the area of its trapped surfaces - boundaries from which light cannot escape.
  The result is established for outermost stable marginally outer trapped surfaces under a favorable geometric condition. When equality holds, the spacetime must be the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a single non-rotating black hole in vacuum. This confirms Penrose's original 1973 conjecture assuming the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis.
  The paper also identifies the key mathematical obstruction in the general case: a certain differential operator lacks a symmetry property that would allow local curvature estimates to be derived from global integral bounds. Additional geometric assumptions are needed to overcome this obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OGRe, a modern Mathematica package for tensor calculus, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. The package can be used in a variety of contexts where tensor calculations are needed, in both mathematics and physics, but it is especially suitable for general relativity. By implementing an object-oriented design paradigm, OGRe allows calculating arbitrarily complicated tensor formulas easily, and automatically transforms between index configurations and coordinate systems behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user errors by making it impossible for the user to combine tensors in inconsistent ways. Other features include displaying tensors in various forms, automatic calculation of curvature tensors and geodesic equations, easy importing and exporting of tensors between sessions, optimized algorithms and parallelization for improved performance, and more.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Spinor bilinears of generalized spinors and their properties are investigated. Generalized Killing and twistor spinor equations are considered and their relations to the equations satisfied by special types of differential forms are found. Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <title>One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is important to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the thermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Logarithmic Spectral Phase Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is deformed to a logarithmically modified self-adjoint operator \begin{equation*} F_\beta(H) = H + \beta H \log \frac{H}{E_*} \end{equation*} for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$ and a fixed reference scale $E_* &gt; 0$. Dynamical phases acquire energy-dependent factors $\exp[-it\beta E \log(E/E_*)]$, whose rapid variation across the spectrum suppresses interference between distinct energies through a non-stationary-phase mechanism. Stationary-phase analysis shows that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$ when $|\beta|$ is large.
  Since $F_\beta(H)$ is self-adjoint for every real $\beta$, the evolution operator $U_\beta(t) = \exp[-itF_\beta(H)]$ is unitary. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- Hilbert-space inner products, projection operators, the Born rule -- remains unchanged. Decoherence arises as suppression of interference terms in coarse-grained observables and decoherence functionals, not as norm loss or stochastic collapse. Physical motivation for logarithmic spectral deformations comes from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections introducing $\log E$ terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses with complex actions generating spectral factors involving $\log(E/E_{\text{P}})$. The mechanism is illustrated with two-level systems, quartic oscillators, FRW minisuperspace models, and Schwarzschild-interior-type Hamiltonians. Current superconducting-qubit coherence times constrain $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-5}$; trapped ions, NV centers, and cold atoms could strengthen this to $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of General Subregions in Time-Dependent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</description>
