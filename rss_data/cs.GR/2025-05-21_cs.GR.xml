      <title>FreeMesh: Boosting Mesh Generation with Coordinates Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-coordinate prediction paradigm has emerged as the de facto standard in current auto-regressive mesh generation methods. Despite their effectiveness, there is no efficient measurement for the various tokenizers that serialize meshes into sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new metric Per-Token-Mesh-Entropy (PTME) to evaluate the existing mesh tokenizers theoretically without any training. Building upon PTME, we propose a plug-and-play tokenization technique called coordinate merging. It further improves the compression ratios of existing tokenizers by rearranging and merging the most frequent patterns of coordinates. Through experiments on various tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we further validate the performance of our method. We hope that the proposed PTME and coordinate merging can enhance the existing mesh tokenizers and guide the further development of native mesh generation.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Multi-Character Interaction Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning. Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.</description>

      <title>A Remeshing Method via Adaptive Multiple Original-Facet-Clipping and Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)-based remeshing optimizes mesh quality by leveraging the Voronoi-Delaunay framework to optimize vertex distribution and produce uniformly distributed vertices with regular triangles. Current CVT-based approaches can be classified into two categories: (1) exact methods (e.g., Geodesic CVT, Restricted Voronoi Diagrams) that ensure high quality but require significant computation; and (2) approximate methods that try to reduce computational complexity yet result in fair quality. To address this trade-off, we propose a CVT-based surface remeshing approach that achieves balanced optimization between quality and efficiency through multiple clipping times of 3D Centroidal Voronoi cells with curvature-adaptive original surface facets. The core idea of the method is that we adaptively adjust the number of clipping times according to local curvature, and use the angular relationship between the normal vectors of neighboring facets to represent the magnitude of local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>MatchDance: Collaborative Mamba-Transformer Architecture Matching for High-Quality 3D Dance Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music-to-dance generation represents a challenging yet pivotal task at the intersection of choreography, virtual reality, and creative content generation. Despite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in achieving choreographic consistency. To address the challenge, we propose MatchDance, a novel framework for music-to-dance generation that constructs a latent representation to enhance choreographic consistency. MatchDance employs a two-stage design: (1) a Kinematic-Dynamic-based Quantization Stage (KDQS), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) with kinematic-dynamic constraints and reconstructs them with high fidelity, and (2) a Hybrid Music-to-Dance Generation Stage(HMDGS), which uses a Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture to map music into the latent representation, followed by the KDQS decoder to generate 3D dance motions. Additionally, a music-dance retrieval framework and comprehensive metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments on the FineDance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>CraftsMan3D: High-fidelity Mesh Generation with 3D Native Generation and Interactive Geometry Refiner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel generative 3D modeling system, coined CraftsMan, which can generate high-fidelity 3D geometries with highly varied shapes, regular mesh topologies, and detailed surfaces, and, notably, allows for refining the geometry in an interactive manner. Despite the significant advancements in 3D generation, existing methods still struggle with lengthy optimization processes, irregular mesh topologies, noisy surfaces, and difficulties in accommodating user edits, consequently impeding their widespread adoption and implementation in 3D modeling software. Our work is inspired by the craftsman, who usually roughs out the holistic figure of the work first and elaborates the surface details subsequently. Specifically, we employ a 3D native diffusion model, which operates on latent space learned from latent set-based 3D representations, to generate coarse geometries with regular mesh topology in seconds. In particular, this process takes as input a text prompt or a reference image and leverages a powerful multi-view (MV) diffusion model to generate multiple views of the coarse geometry, which are fed into our MV-conditioned 3D diffusion model for generating the 3D geometry, significantly improving robustness and generalizability. Following that, a normal-based geometry refiner is used to significantly enhance the surface details. This refinement can be performed automatically, or interactively with user-supplied edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high efficacy in producing superior-quality 3D assets compared to existing methods.
