      <title>Biomechanics of orientationally ordered epithelial tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organogenesis involves large deformations and complex shape changes that require elaborate mechanical regulation. Models of tissue biomechanics have been introduced to account for the coupling between mechanical response and biochemical processes. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the mechanical response of epithelial tissue is strongly anisotropic, with the degree of anisotropy being correlated with the existence of long range orientational order of cytoskeletal organization across the tissue. A theoretical framework is introduced that captures the dynamic feedback between tissue elastic response and cytoskeletal reorganization under stress. Within the linear regime for small and uniform applied strains, the shear modulus is effectively reduced by the nematic order in cytoskeletal alignment induced by the applied strain. This prediction agrees with experimental observations of epithelial response in lithographically patterned micro tissues.</description>

      <title>Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.</description>

      <title>From Heteropolymer Stiffness Distributions to Effective Homopolymers: A Conformational Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are characterized by a lack of defined secondary and tertiary structures, and are thus well-suited for descriptions within polymer theory. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of proteins, stemming from their diverse amino acid building blocks, introduces local variations in chain stiffness, which can impact conformational behavior at larger scales. To investigate this effect, we developed a heterogeneous worm-like chain model in which the local persistence length follows a Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that these heterogeneous chains can be effectively mapped to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. To assess whether this mapping can be extended to naturally occurring IDPs, we performed simulations using various coarse-grained IDP models, finding that the simulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and heterogeneous worm-like chains. However, the IDPs are systematically larger than ideal worm-like chains, yet slightly more compact when excluded volume interactions are considered. We attribute these differences to intramolecular interactions between non-bonded monomers, which our theoretical models do not account for.</description>

      <title>Organisation and dynamics of individual DNA segments in topologically complex genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing the physical organisation and dynamics of genomic regions is one of the major open challenges in biology. The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a topologically complex genome, made by thousands of DNA (mini and maxi) circles interlinked into a two-dimensional Olympic network. The organisation and dynamics of these DNA circles are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that dCas9 linked to Quantum Dots can efficiently label different classes of DNA minicircles in kDNA. We use this method to study the distribution and dynamics of different classes of DNA minicircles within the network. We discover that maxicircles display a preference to localise at the periphery of the network and that they undergo subdiffusive dynamics. From the latter, we can also quantify the effective network stiffness, confirming previous indirect estimations via AFM. Our method could be used more generally, to quantify the location, dynamics and material properties of genomic regions in other complex genomes, such as that of bacteria, and to study their behaviour in the presence of DNA-binding proteins.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on simulating nonlinear behaviors of flexible structures with the discrete differential geometry (DDG) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible elastic structures, such as beams, rods, ribbons, plates, and shells, exhibit complex nonlinear dynamical behaviors that are central to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications, including soft robotics, deployable structures, and biomedical devices. While various numerical methods have been developed to simulate these behaviors, many conventional approaches struggle to simultaneously capture geometric and material nonlinearities, as well as nonlinear external interactions, particularly in highly deformable and dynamically evolving systems. The Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) method has emerged as a robust and efficient numerical framework that intrinsically preserves geometric properties, accommodates material nonlinearity, and accurately models interactions with external environments and fields. By directly discretizing geometric and mechanical quantities, DDG provides an accurate, stable, and efficient approach to modeling flexible structures, addressing key limitations of traditional numerical methods. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the DDG method for simulating nonlinear behaviors in flexible structures. It covers DDG theory, simulation frameworks, and MATLAB implementation, with examples spanning dynamic systems, geometric and material nonlinearities, and external interactions like magnetics and fluids, culminating in practical insights and future directions. By offering a comprehensive and practical guide, together with open-source MATLAB code, this tutorial aims to facilitate the broader adoption of DDG-based numerical tools among researchers and engineers in computational mechanics, applied mathematics, and structural design.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling dislocations in quasicrystals through amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) are a class of aperiodic ordered structures that emerge in various systems, from metallic alloys to soft matter and driven non-equilibrium systems. Within a mesoscale theory based on slowly-varying complex amplitudes for QCs, we track dislocations as topological defects harbored by the amplitudes and characterize their Burgers vectors and induced deformations. We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent interfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a hierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze interfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of periodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations associated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability, interaction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also discussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of dislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional crystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations in systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Spin-Wave Propagation in Anisotropy-Graded Iron Films Prepared by Nitrogen Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradual modification of the magnetic properties in ferromagnetic films has recently been proposed as an effective method to channel and control spin waves for the development of new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we investigate graded FeN films prepared by low-dose nitrogen implantation of Fe epitaxial thin films. Combining Brillouin light scattering measurements and a spin-wave theoretical approach, we show that nitrogen implantation induces a graded profile of both the in-plane and the perpendicular anisotropies along the film thickness. This graduation leads to a significant modification of the spin-wave spatial localization and generates a marked frequency asymmetry in the spin-wave dispersion. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy profile, and as a consequence the dispersion relation, can be tuned on changing the implantation dose, opening a way for the potential use of the graded Fe-N films in magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous depinning/yielding transition of elastic manifolds with tailored internal elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider elastic manifolds evolving on disordered energy potentials under the action of an external uniform driving. This scenario includes the cases of {\em depinning} and {\em yielding}, which provide paradigmatic examples of out of equilibrium phase transitions. In both cases, velocity of the manifold is zero at low driving force, and increases smoothly when a critical driving is exceeded,defining a continuous flow-curve for these systems. We show that when more general forms of the manifold elasticity are considered, the flow curve may become reentrant, and the transition hysteretic, or discontinuous. This constitutes a novel scenario for a discontinuous transition out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Crystal nucleation and growth in high-entropy alloys revealed by atomic electron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) balance mixing entropy and intermetallic phase formation enthalpy, creating a vast compositional space for structural and functional materials (1-6). They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility trade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies in catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their structural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs challenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23). The intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple principal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways (5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale observations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect measurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive. Here, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic structure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy nuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that decreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As nuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce without misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain these experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways model, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through multiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only provide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but also offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other materials.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Structure of Push-Pull Conjugated Polymer Aggregates in Solution and Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology of conjugated polymer films is highly tunable, influencing their performance in organic electronics. Specifically, molecular packing or crystal structure strongly influence electronic processes such as light absorption and charge transfer. However, the unit cells of high-performance electron donor polymers remain unknown, limiting the understanding of how processing affects structure and device performance. This study characterizes the aggregate structure of PM6-type push-pull polymers using X-ray scattering, cryogenic electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A novel forward simulation approach linking grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) with MD resolves a monoclinic unit cell that accurately describes PM6-type polymer aggregates in both thin films and casting solutions. Intimate pi-pi stacking between donor and acceptor units emerges from this unit cell. Analysis of experimental GIWAXS using this unit cell quantifies sliding disorder in these aggregates, which may impact device performance. The shape and internal structure of solution aggregates are also identified in chlorobenzene. These findings enhance our understanding of PM6-type polymer packing, outline a strategy for elucidating the crystal structure of weakly ordered materials, and provide an opportunity to control optoelectronic performance through aggregate formation in PM6 and other push-pull conjugated polymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet's weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Colloidal structure, energy extensivity and Monte Carlo sampling properties of improved short-range interaction models for surfactant-coated magnetic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard DLVO theory offers a limited description of ionic-surfacted magnetic colloids in near aggregation regimes. Correcting the electrical double layer term for ionic surfactants is not enough to successfully simulate the systems. The correction of the van der Waals energy divergence at short interparticle distances is fundamental for proper Monte Carlo sampling of nanoparticles' configurations. We compare different short-range interaction models and show that a more detailed model leads to Monte Carlo simulations that better match theoretical expectations. Studying the energy scaling with the number of particles, we observe a slight deviation from energy extensivity across all models, small but still detectable via Akaike's information criterion. The more detailed model predicts a strong effect of particle-size dispersity on the transition between overall attraction and repulsion. More precise modeling can significantly affect numerical predictions, in particular, the effect of particle-size dispersity on the spatial structure of colloids with high volume fraction. This emphasizes the importance of nailing down better models for describing complex colloidal dispersions.</description>

      <title>Theory of active self-organization of dense nematic structures in the actin cytoskeleton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton is remarkably adaptable and multifunctional. It often organizes into nematic bundles such as contractile rings or stress fibers. However, how a uniform and isotropic actin gel self-organizes into dense nematic bundles is not fully understood. Here, using an active gel model accounting for nematic order and density variations, we identify an active patterning mechanism leading to localized dense nematic structures. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear finite element simulations establish the conditions for nematic bundle self-assembly and how active gel parameters control the architecture, orientation, connectivity and dynamics of self-organized patterns. Finally, we substantiate with discrete network simulations the main requirements for nematic bundle formation according to our theory, namely increased active tension perpendicular to the nematic direction and generalized active forces conjugate to nematic order. Our work portrays actin gels a reconfigurable active materials with a spontaneous tendency to develop patterns of dense nematic bundles.</description>

Abstract: Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.</description>
