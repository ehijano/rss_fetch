      <title>Time-resolved 3D momentum spectroscopy in continuous wave atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental continuous-wave (cw) pump-probe scheme is demonstrated by investigating the population and photoionization dynamics of an atomic system. Specifically, $^6$Li atoms are initially prepared in optically pumped $2^{2}S_{1/2}$ and $2^{2}P_{3/2}$ states before being excited via multi-photon absorption from a tunable femtosecond laser. The subsequent cascade back to the ground state is analyzed by ionizing the atoms in the field of a cw optical dipole trap laser. Conventional spectroscopic methods such as standard cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) or velocity map imaging (VMI) cannot provide simultaneous momentum and time-resolved information on an event-by-event basis for the system investigated here. The new approach overcomes this limitation by leveraging electron-recoil ion coincidences, momentum conservation, and the cyclotron motion of the photoelectron in the magnetic spectrometer field. This enables the reconstruction of ionization times and time-of-flight of the charged target fragments with nanosecond resolution. As a result, not only can three-dimensional photoelectron momentum vectors be determined, but the (incoherent) population dynamics of the atomic system also become accessible. Future applications exploring coherent atomic dynamics on the nanosecond timescale would not only expand the scope of time-resolved spectroscopy but can also aid in developing coherent control schemes for precise atomic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Emergent spatial symmetry and inter-manifold avoided crossing of spin-1 lattice gas in the intermediate interaction regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-filling spin-1 lattice gas in the intermediate interaction regime, in which the atom-atom interaction allows the decomposition of the system into the coupled spin and charge sectors, with lower energetical detuning between the two sectors than in the strong interaction regime. The low-lying eigenstates are grouped into different manifolds due to the decomposition, and are endowed with the emergent spatial inversion symmetry separately in the spin and charge sectors, which induces hidden correlations and affects the spin distribution of the system. The lowered energetical detuning between the two sectors activates the inter-sector coupling, and overlaps different manifolds in the eigenenergy spectrum, which leads to the crossings of eigenstates from different manifolds. The inter-sector coupling between the spin and charges is then witnessed by the the inter-manifold avoided crossings, which takes place between accidentally degenerate eigenstates of the same symmetry parity. Our work reveals the enhanced coupling effects between the spin and charge dopants of the spinor lattice gas in the intermediate interaction regime.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion collision spectroscopy at the CRYRING@ESR electron cooler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-ion collision spectroscopy at heavy-ion storage rings aims at precision measurements of resonance features that occur in the cross sections of electron collision processes such as electron-impact ionization of ions or electron-ion recombination. As part of the international FAIR project, the low-energy ion storage ring CRYRING@ESR has been coupled with the heavy-ion accelerators operated by the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy-Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. This has created a new opportunity for stringent tests of strong field quantum electrodynamics by electron-ion collision spectroscopy of heavy few-electron ions. The present contribution provides details of the electron-ion collision spectroscopy setup at CRYRING@ESR and of the associated data-analysis procedures along with first results for nonresonant and resonant recombination of berylliumlike lead ions. For nonresonant recombination a recombination rate enhancement factor of 3.5 is found at zero electron-ion collision energy. For resonant recombination there is excellent agreement with recent theoretical results when these are shifted by 340~meV in energy.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions for bound states in antiprotonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of bound states of antiprotons in close proximity to the atomic nucleus. Using experimental data from X-ray spectroscopy measurements of antiprotonic atom transitions, we tune a minimal theoretical framework and estimate parameter ranges where the strong or electromagnetic decay channels govern the stability of the deepest bound states. In this way, we present an overview of the dominant decay mechanism of antiprotonic orbits for a given principle quantum number, which may be useful for future spectroscopic experiments on antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine and Zeeman Optical Pumping and Transverse Laser Cooling of a Thermal Atomic Beam of Dysprosium Using a Single 421 nm Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17310v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of Zeeman and hyperfine optical pumping and transverse laser cooling of a dysprosium (Dy) atomic beam on the $4f^{10}6s^2(J = 8) \rightarrow 4f^{10}6s6p(J = 9)$ transition at 421.291 nm. For $^{163}$Dy, an electro-optic modulator is used to generate five frequency sidebands required to pump the atoms to the $F = 10.5$ ground state hyperfine level and the light polarization is chosen to pump the atoms to the $m_F = 10.5$ Zeeman sublevel. The atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled using a standing wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. The resulting polarized and cooled atomic beam will be used in fundamental physics experiments taking advantage of the accidental degeneracy of excited states in Dy including the ongoing measurement of parity violation in this system.</description>

      <title>Relativistic many-body calculations of multipole (E1, M1, E2, M2) transition properties in Al II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systematic relativistic many-body calculations of multipole transition properties for singly charged aluminum ion (Al II) using a method that combines the configuration interaction and many-body perturbation theory (CI+MBPT). Our calculations cover the 103 lowest energy levels in Al II. For five key low-lying configurations (3s2 1S0, 3s3p 3P0, 3s3p 3P1, 3s3p 3P2, 3s3p 1P1), we tabulate the transition wavelengths, reduced matrix elements, transition probabilities, and oscillator strengths for about 400 electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), electric quadrupole (E2), and magnetic quadrupole (M2) transitions arising from these levels. Our calculated values agree well with available experimental data and other high-precision theoretical calculations, with typical deviations on the order of 1%. Notably, we report over 80% of these transition lines as previously unreported, significantly expanding the existing spectroscopic database for Al II. These results can serve as a valuable reference resource for ongoing precision quantum metrology as well as astrophysical spectroscopy involving Al II ion.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{P}$-odd electron-nucleon interaction via a Higgs-boson exchange at the quark-gluon level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron pseudoscalar -- nucleon scalar $\mathcal{T}$,~$\mathcal{P}$-odd interaction within the framework of the Standard Model is considered as an exchange mediated by the Higgs boson at the quark-gluon level. $\mathcal{CP}$ violation is introduced through a phase factor in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which characterizes the flavor structure of the quark loop. We explicitly demonstrate that the total three-loop contribution vanishes for the Higgs boson exchange mechanism. A nonzero contribution appears at the four-loop quark-gluon level only with the insertion of an additional gluon line between the quarks. The estimate of the $\mathcal{CP}$-odd electron-nucleon interaction coupling constant after reduction of divergencies of the quark loop integral using the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism yields a value $ \sim10^{-28}$. The final result, expressed in terms of the equivalent electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM), is $10^{-48} \,\, e\text{cm}$, and its order of magnitude coincides with that of the GIM estimate of the $e$EDM at the quark-gluon level. Our parametric estimate of the $e$EDM differs from previous studies by a factor that depends on the mass of the $b$ quark.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-Dependent Photodissociation of Iodomethylbutane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort XUV pulses of the Free-Electron-LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) were used to investigate laser-induced fragmentation patterns of the prototypical chiral molecule 1-iodo-2-methyl-butane (C$_5$H$_{11}$I) in a pump-probe scheme. Ion velocity-map images and mass spectra of optical-laser-induced fragmentation were obtained for subsequent FEL exposure with photon energies of 63 eV and 75 eV. These energies specifically address the iodine 4d edge of neutral and singly charged iodine, respectively. The presented ion spectra for two optical pump-laser wavelengths, i.e., 800 nm and 267 nm, reveal substantially different cationic fragment yields in dependence on the wavelength and intensity. For the case of 800-nm-initiated fragmentation, the molecule dissociates notably slower than for the 267-nm pump. The results underscore the importance of considering optical-laser wavelength and intensity in the dissociation dynamics of this prototypical chiral molecule that is a promising candidate for future studies of its asymmetric nature.</description>

      <title>Image Current Detection of Electrons in a Room-Temperature Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the image current detection of electrons in a room-temperature Paul trap at microwave frequencies. By selectively leveraging distinct cavity modes for trapping and detection, our approach effectively extracts electron signals otherwise buried in the microwave drive used for pseudo-potential formation. When the trapped electrons resonate with the cavity mode, we observe a mode excitation and its exponential decay attributed to resistive cooling. Detuning electrons from the cavity resonance halts this decay, and sweeping electrons' secular frequency reveals their oscillatory spectrum. Implementing this experiment at cryogenic temperatures could enable the image current detection and ground-state cooling of a single electron in Paul traps.</description>

      <title>Inducing And Probing Charge Migration In Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological advancements in generation of ultrafast and intense laser pulses have enabled the real-time observation and control of charge migration in molecules on their natural timescale, which ranges from few femtoseconds to several hundreds of attoseconds. Present thesis discusses the effect of symmetry on the adiabatic attosecond charge migration in different molecular systems. The spatial representation of the charge migration is documented by time-dependent electronic charge and flux densities. Furthermore, the induced charge migration is imaged via time resolved x-ray diffraction (TRXD) with atomic-scale spatiotemporal resolution in few cases.</description>

      <title>Robust treatment of finite nuclear size reduces CKM unitarity deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. We show that the dependence of the decay rate of $^{26m}$Al on its charge radius is 4 times greater than previously believed, so it must be determined with high precision. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a highly different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical Engineering of Strongly Driven Nonlinear Systems Beyond Floquet and Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly driven nonlinear systems are frequently encountered in physics, yet their accurate control is generally challenging due to the intricate dynamics. In this work, we present a non-perturbative, semi-analytical framework for tailoring such systems. The key idea is heuristically extending the Floquet theory to nonlinear differential equations using the Harmonic Balance method. Additionally, we establish a novel constrained optimization technique inspired by the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enables accurate engineering of effective potentials across a broader parameter space, surpassing the limitations of perturbative methods. Our method offers practical implementations in diverse experimental platforms, facilitating nonclassical state generation, versatile bosonic quantum simulations, and solving complex optimization problems across quantum and classical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain interferometry is an important principle in Fourier transform (FT) and nonlinear femto- to attosecond spectroscopy. To optimize the resolution and sensitivity of this approach, various interferometer stabilization schemes have been developed. Among them, acousto-optical phase modulation (AOPM) of the interferometer arms combined with phase-synchronous lock-in detection has proven as a particular sensitive technique. However, the acousto-optical modulators (AOMs), required for this technique, introduce several disadvantages. Here, we demonstrate an alternative phase modulation scheme which omits AOMs, termed PM scheme here. As a benchmark, we directly compare the performance between the PM and the AOPM scheme in a linear FT spectroscopy experiment and find almost identical sensitivity in both approaches.</description>

      <title>Parallelized telecom quantum networking with a ytterbium-171 atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of quantum computers and sensors into a quantum network opens a new frontier for quantum information science. We demonstrate high-fidelity entanglement between ytterbium-171 atoms -- the basis for state-of-the-art atomic quantum processors and optical atomic clocks -- and optical photons directly generated in the telecommunication wavelength band where loss in optical fiber is minimal. We entangle the nuclear spin of the atom with a single photon in the time bin basis, and find an atom measurement-corrected (raw) atom-photon Bell state fidelity of $0.950(9)\pm0.005(3)_\text{bound}$ ($0.90(1)\pm0.014(3)_\text{bound}$). Photon measurement errors contribute $\approx0.037$ to our infidelity and can be removed with straightforward upgrades. Additionally, by imaging our atom array onto an optical fiber array, we demonstrate a parallelized networking protocol that can provide an $N$-fold boost in the remote entanglement rate. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to preserve coherence on a memory qubit while performing networking operations on communication qubits. Our work is a major step towards the integration of atomic processors and optical clocks into a high-rate or long-distance quantum network.</description>
