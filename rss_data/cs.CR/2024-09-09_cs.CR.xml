      <title>ARSecure: A Novel End-to-End Encryption Messaging System Using Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) ensures that only the intended recipient(s) can read messages. Popular instant messaging (IM) applications such as Signal, WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, and Telegram claim to offer E2EE. However, client-side scanning (CSS) undermines these claims by scanning all messages, including text, images, audio, and video files, on both sending and receiving ends. Industry and government parties support CSS to combat harmful content such as child pornography, terrorism, and other illegal activities. In this paper, we introduce ARSecure, a novel end-to-end encryption messaging solution utilizing augmented reality glasses. ARSecure allows users to encrypt and decrypt their messages before they reach their phone devices, effectively countering the CSS technology in E2EE systems.</description>

      <title>WET: Overcoming Paraphrasing Vulnerabilities in Embeddings-as-a-Service with Linear Transformation Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) is a service offered by large language model (LLM) developers to supply embeddings generated by LLMs. Previous research suggests that EaaS is prone to imitation attacks -- attacks that clone the underlying EaaS model by training another model on the queried embeddings. As a result, EaaS watermarks are introduced to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers. In this paper, we first show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed by paraphrasing when attackers clone the model. Subsequently, we propose a novel watermarking technique that involves linearly transforming the embeddings, and show that it is empirically and theoretically robust against paraphrasing.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Applying Security Assurance Cases for Automotive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security Assurance Cases (SAC) are structured bodies of arguments and evidence used to reason about security properties of a certain artefact. SAC are gaining focus in the automotive domain as the need for security assurance is growing due to software becoming a main part of vehicles. Market demands for new services and products in the domain require connectivity, and hence, raise security concerns. Regulators and standardisation bodies started recently to require a structured for security assurance of products in the automotive domain, and automotive companies started, hence, to study ways to create and maintain these cases, as well as adopting them in their current way of working.
  In order to facilitate the adoption of SAC in the automotive domain, we created CASCADE, an approach for creating SAC which have integrated quality assurance and are compliant with the requirements of ISO/SAE-21434, the upcoming cybersecurity standard for automotive systems. CASCADE was created by conducting design science research study in two iterative cycles. The design decisions of CASCADE are based on insights from a qualitative research study which includes a workshop, a survey, and one-to-one interviews, done in collaboration with our industrial partners about the needs and drivers of work in SAC in industry, and a systematic literature review in which we identified gaps between the industrial needs and the state of the art.
  The evaluation of CASCADE was done with help of security experts from a large automotive OEM. It showed that CASCADE is suitable for integration in industrial product development processes. Additionally, our results show that the elements of CASCADE align well with respect to the way of working at the company, and has the potential to scale to cover the requirements and needs of the company with its large organization and complex products</description>

      <title>The HitchHiker's Guide to High-Assurance System Observability Protection with Efficient Permission Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting system observability records (logs) from compromised OSs has gained significant traction in recent times, with several note-worthy approaches proposed. Unfortunately, none of the proposed approaches achieve high performance with tiny log protection delays. They also leverage risky environments for protection (\eg many use general-purpose hypervisors or TrustZone, which have large TCB and attack surfaces). HitchHiker is an attempt to rectify this problem. The system is designed to ensure (a) in-memory protection of batched logs within a short and configurable real-time deadline by efficient hardware permission switching, and (b) an end-to-end high-assurance environment built upon hardware protection primitives with debloating strategies for secure log protection, persistence, and management. Security evaluations and validations show that HitchHiker reduces log protection delay by 93.3--99.3% compared to the state-of-the-art, while reducing TCB by 9.4--26.9X. Performance evaluations show HitchHiker incurs a geometric mean of less than 6% overhead on diverse real-world programs, improving on the state-of-the-art approach by 61.9--77.5%.</description>

      <title>Comment on Revisiting Neural Program Smoothing for Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MLFuzz, a work accepted at ACM FSE 2023, revisits the performance of a machine learning-based fuzzer, NEUZZ. We demonstrate that its main conclusion is entirely wrong due to several fatal bugs in the implementation and wrong evaluation setups, including an initialization bug in persistent mode, a program crash, an error in training dataset collection, and a mistake in fuzzing result collection. Additionally, MLFuzz uses noisy training datasets without sufficient data cleaning and preprocessing, which contributes to a drastic performance drop in NEUZZ. We address these issues and provide a corrected implementation and evaluation setup, showing that NEUZZ consistently performs well over AFL on the FuzzBench dataset. Finally, we reflect on the evaluation methods used in MLFuzz and offer practical advice on fair and scientific fuzzing evaluations.</description>

      <title>Detection of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) on Power Dynamical Systems With a State Prediction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deeper penetration of inverter-based resources in power systems, false data injection attacks (FDIA) are a growing cyber-security concern. They have the potential to disrupt the system's stability like frequency stability, thereby leading to catastrophic failures. Therefore, an FDIA detection method would be valuable to protect power systems. FDIAs typically induce a discrepancy between the desired and the effective behavior of the power system dynamics. A suitable detection method can leverage power dynamics predictions to identify whether such a discrepancy was induced by an FDIA. This work investigates the efficacy of temporal and spatio-temporal state prediction models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with LSTM, for predicting frequency dynamics in the absence of an FDIA but with noisy measurements, and thereby identify FDIA events. For demonstration purposes, the IEEE 39 New England Kron-reduced model simulated with a swing equation is considered. It is shown that the proposed state prediction models can be used as a building block for developing an effective FDIA detection method that can maintain high detection accuracy across various attack and deployment settings. It is also shown how the FDIA detection should be deployed to limit its exposure to detection inaccuracies and mitigate its computational burden.</description>

      <title>The Kubernetes Security Landscape: AI-Driven Insights from Developer Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kubernetes, the go-to container orchestration solution, has swiftly become the industry standard for managing containers at scale in production environments. Its widespread adoption, particularly in large organizations, has elevated its profile and made it a prime target for security concerns. This study aims to understand how prevalent security concerns are among Kubernetes practitioners by analyzing all Kubernetes posts made on Stack Overflow over the past four years. We gathered security insights from Kubernetes practitioners and transformed the data through machine learning algorithms for cleaning and topic clustering. Subsequently, we used advanced AI tools to automatically generate topic descriptions, thereby reducing the analysis process. In our analysis, security-related posts ranked as the fourth most prevalent topic in these forums, comprising 12.3% of the overall discussions. Furthermore, the findings indicated that although the frequency of security discussions has remained constant, their popularity and influence have experienced significant growth. Kubernetes users consistently prioritize security topics, and the rising popularity of security posts reflects a growing interest and concern for maintaining secure Kubernetes clusters. The findings underscore key security issues that warrant further research and the development of additional tools to resolve them.</description>

      <title>PANTS: Practical Adversarial Network Traffic Samples against ML-powered Networking Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple network management tasks, from resource allocation to intrusion detection, rely on some form of ML-based network-traffic classification (MNC). Despite their potential, MNCs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which can lead to outages, poor decision-making, and security violations, among other issues.
  The goal of this paper is to help network operators assess and enhance the robustness of their MNC against adversarial inputs. The most critical step for this is generating inputs that can fool the MNC while being realizable under various threat models. Compared to other ML models, finding adversarial inputs against MNCs is more challenging due to the existence of non-differentiable components e.g., traffic engineering and the need to constrain inputs to preserve semantics and ensure reliability. These factors prevent the direct use of well-established gradient-based methods developed in adversarial ML (AML).
  To address these challenges, we introduce PANTS, a practical white-box framework that uniquely integrates AML techniques with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to generate adversarial inputs for MNCs. We also embed PANTS into an iterative adversarial training process that enhances the robustness of MNCs against adversarial inputs. PANTS is 70% and 2x more likely in median to find adversarial inputs against target MNCs compared to two state-of-the-art baselines, namely Amoeba and BAP. Integrating PANTS into the adversarial training process enhances the robustness of the target MNCs by 52.7% without sacrificing their accuracy. Critically, these PANTS-robustified MNCs are more robust than their vanilla counterparts against distinct attack-generation methodologies.</description>

      <title>LiTelFuzz : Swarms Fuzzing Based on Linear Temporal Logic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot swarms utilize swarm intelligence to collaborate on tasks and play an increasingly significant role in a variety of practical scenarios. However, due to the complex design, multi-robot swarm systems often have vulnerabilities caused by logical errors, which can severely disrupt the normal operations of multi-robot swarms. Despite the significant security threats that logical vulnerabilities pose to multi-robot swarms, there are still considerable challenges in testing and identifying these vulnerabilities, and related research still faces two major challenges: 1) the explosion of input space for testing, 2) the lack of effective test-guidance strategies. Therefore, in this paper, we overcome the two major challenges mentioned above, and propose a formal verification method to discover logical flaws in multi-robot swarms. Specifically, we abstract linear temporal logic constraints of the swarm and compute swarm robustness based on these constraints thus guiding fuzzing, we call this approach LiTelFuzz (Fuzzing based on Linear Temporal Logic Constraints). The core idea of LiTelFuzz is to design a metric based on behavioral constraints to assess the state of the multi-robot swarm at different moments, and guide fuzz testing based on the assessment results. Based on this idea, we overcome the two challenges of excessive test case input space and the lack of fuzzing guidance. Consequently, we implement a single attack drone fuzzing scheme and a multiple attack drones scheme based on LiTelFuzz. These are named SA-Fuzzing and MA-Fuzzing, respectively. Finally, we tested three popular swarm algorithms using LiTelFuzz with an average success rate of 87.35% for SA-Fuzzing and 91.73% for MA-Fuzzing to find vulnerabilities. The success rate and efficiency are better than the existing state-of-the-art fuzzer SWARMFLAWFINDER.</description>

      <title>Strong Privacy-Preserving Universally Composable AKA Protocol with Seamless Handover Support for Mobile Virtual Network Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumers seeking a new mobile plan have many choices in the present mobile landscape. The Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) has recently gained considerable attention among these options. MVNOs offer various benefits, making them an appealing choice for a majority of consumers. These advantages encompass flexibility, access to cutting-edge technologies, enhanced coverage, superior customer service, and substantial cost savings. Even though MVNO offers several advantages, it also creates some security and privacy concerns for the customer simultaneously. For instance, in the existing solution, MVNO needs to hand over all the sensitive details, including the users' identities and master secret keys of their customers, to a mobile operator (MNO) to validate the customers while offering any services. This allows MNOs to have unrestricted access to the MVNO subscribers' location and mobile data, including voice calls, SMS, and Internet, which the MNOs frequently sell to third parties (e.g., advertisement companies and surveillance agencies) for more profit. Although critical for mass users, such privacy loss has been historically ignored due to the lack of practical and privacy-preserving solutions for registration and handover procedures in cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a universally composable authentication and handover scheme with strong user privacy support, where each MVNO user can validate a mobile operator (MNO) and vice-versa without compromising user anonymity and unlinkability support. Here, we anticipate that our proposed solution will most likely be deployed by the MVNO(s) to ensure enhanced privacy support to their customer(s).</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Hide: Provable and Adjustable Diffusion Generative Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Steganography (GS) is a novel technique that utilizes generative models to conceal messages without relying on cover images. Contemporary GS algorithms leverage the powerful generative capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) to create high-fidelity stego images. However, these algorithms, while yielding relatively satisfactory generation outcomes and message extraction accuracy, significantly alter modifications to the initial Gaussian noise of DMs, thereby compromising steganographic security. In this paper, we rethink the trade-off among image quality, steganographic security, and message extraction accuracy within Diffusion Generative Steganography (DGS) settings. Our findings reveal that the normality of initial noise of DMs is crucial to these factors and can offer theoretically grounded guidance for DGS design. Based on this insight, we propose a Provable and Adjustable Message Mapping (PA-B2G) approach. It can, on one hand, theoretically guarantee reversible encoding of bit messages from arbitrary distributions into standard Gaussian noise for DMs. On the other hand, its adjustability provides a more natural and fine-grained way to trade off image quality, steganographic security, and message extraction accuracy. By integrating PA-B2G with a probability flow ordinary differential equation, we establish an invertible mapping between secret messages and stego images. PA-B2G can be seamlessly incorporated with most mainstream DMs, such as the Stable Diffusion, without necessitating additional training or fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments corroborate our theoretical insights regarding the trade-off in DGS settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGS algorithm in producing high-quality stego images while preserving desired levels of steganographic security and extraction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards identifying Source credibility on Information Leakage in Digital Gadget Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Social media to share content is on a constant rise. One of the capsize effect of information sharing on Social media includes the spread of sensitive information on the public domain. With the digital gadget market becoming highly competitive and ever-evolving, the trend of an increasing number of sensitive posts leaking information on devices in social media is observed. Many web-blogs on digital gadget market have mushroomed recently, making the problem of information leak all pervasive. Credible leaks on specifics of an upcoming device can cause a lot of financial damage to the respective organization. Hence, it is crucial to assess the credibility of the platforms that continuously post about a smartphone or digital gadget leaks. In this work, we analyze the headlines of leak web-blog posts and their corresponding official press-release. We first collect 54, 495 leak and press-release headlines for different smartphones. We train our custom NER model to capture the evolving smartphone names with an accuracy of 82.14% on manually annotated results. We further propose a credibility score metric for the web-blog, based on the number of falsified and authentic smartphone leak posts.</description>

      <title>PIXHELL Attack: Leaking Sensitive Information from Air-Gap Computers via `Singing Pixels'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-gapped systems are disconnected from the Internet and other networks because they contain or process sensitive data. However, it is known that attackers can use computer speakers to leak data via sound to circumvent the air-gap defense. To cope with this threat, when highly sensitive data is involved, the prohibition of loudspeakers or audio hardware might be enforced. This measure is known as an `audio gap'.
  In this paper, we present PIXHELL, a new type of covert channel attack allowing hackers to leak information via noise generated by the pixels on the screen. No audio hardware or loudspeakers is required. Malware in the air-gap and audio-gap computers generates crafted pixel patterns that produce noise in the frequency range of 0 - 22 kHz. The malicious code exploits the sound generated by coils and capacitors to control the frequencies emanating from the screen. Acoustic signals can encode and transmit sensitive information. We present the adversarial attack model, cover related work, and provide technical background. We discuss bitmap generation and correlated acoustic signals and provide implementation details on the modulation and demodulation process. We evaluated the covert channel on various screens and tested it with different types of information. We also discuss \textit{evasion and stealth} using low-brightness patterns that appear like black, turned-off screens. Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures. Our test shows that with a PIXHELL attack, textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped, audio-gapped computers at a distance of 2m via sound modulated from LCD screens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a three-point biometric authentication system for a blockchain-based decentralized identity network. We use existing biometric authentication systems to demonstrate the unique noise fingerprints that belong to each individual human and the respective information leak from the biological characteristics. We then propose the concept of using unique thermal noise amplitudes generated by each user and explore the open questions regarding the robustness of unconditionally secure authentication.</description>

      <title>Balancing Security and Accuracy: A Novel Federated Learning Approach for Cyberattack Detection in Blockchain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Collaborative Cyberattack Detection (CCD) system aimed at enhancing the security of blockchain-based data-sharing networks by addressing the complex challenges associated with noise addition in federated learning models. Leveraging the theoretical principles of differential privacy, our approach strategically integrates noise into trained sub-models before reconstructing the global model through transmission. We systematically explore the effects of various noise types, i.e., Gaussian, Laplace, and Moment Accountant, on key performance metrics, including attack detection accuracy, deep learning model convergence time, and the overall runtime of global model generation. Our findings reveal the intricate trade-offs between ensuring data privacy and maintaining system performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing these parameters for diverse CCD environments. Through extensive simulations, we provide actionable recommendations for achieving an optimal balance between data protection and system efficiency, contributing to the advancement of secure and reliable blockchain networks.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptography misuses are prevalent in the wild. Crypto APIs are hard to use for developers, and static analysis tools do not detect every misuse. We developed SafEncrypt, an API that streamlines encryption tasks for Java developers. It is built on top of the native Java Cryptography Architecture, and it shields developers from crypto complexities and erroneous low-level details. Experiments showed that SafEncrypt is suitable for developers with varying levels of experience.</description>

      <title>Efficient Homomorphically Encrypted Convolutional Neural Network Without Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving neural network (NN) inference can be achieved by utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows computations to be directly carried out over ciphertexts. Popular HE schemes are built over large polynomial rings. To allow simultaneous multiplications in the convolutional (Conv) and fully-connected (FC) layers, multiple input data are mapped to coefficients in the same polynomial, so are the weights of NNs. However, ciphertext rotations are necessary to compute the sums of products and/or incorporate the outputs of different channels into the same polynomials. Ciphertext rotations have much higher complexity than ciphertext multiplications and contribute to the majority of the latency of HE-evaluated Conv and FC layers. This paper proposes a novel reformulated server-client joint computation procedure and a new filter coefficient packing scheme to eliminate ciphertext rotations without affecting the security of the HE scheme. Our proposed scheme also leads to substantial reductions on the number of coefficient multiplications needed and the communication cost between the server and client. For various plain-20 classifiers over the CIFAR-10/100 datasets, our design reduces the running time of the Conv and FC layers by 15.5% and the communication cost between client and server by more than 50%, compared to the best prior design.</description>

      <title>NetDPSyn: Synthesizing Network Traces under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the utilization of network traces for the network measurement research becomes increasingly prevalent, concerns regarding privacy leakage from network traces have garnered the public's attention. To safeguard network traces, researchers have proposed the trace synthesis that retains the essential properties of the raw data. However, previous works also show that synthesis traces with generative models are vulnerable under linkage attacks.
  This paper introduces NetDPSyn, the first system to synthesize high-fidelity network traces under privacy guarantees. NetDPSyn is built with the Differential Privacy (DP) framework as its core, which is significantly different from prior works that apply DP when training the generative model. The experiments conducted on three flow and two packet datasets indicate that NetDPSyn achieves much better data utility in downstream tasks like anomaly detection. NetDPSyn is also 2.5 times faster than the other methods on average in data synthesis.</description>

      <title>TERD: A Unified Framework for Safeguarding Diffusion Models Against Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved notable success in image generation, but they remain highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which compromise their integrity by producing specific undesirable outputs when presented with a pre-defined trigger. In this paper, we investigate how to protect diffusion models from this dangerous threat. Specifically, we propose TERD, a backdoor defense framework that builds unified modeling for current attacks, which enables us to derive an accessible reversed loss. A trigger reversion strategy is further employed: an initial approximation of the trigger through noise sampled from a prior distribution, followed by refinement through differential multi-step samplers. Additionally, with the reversed trigger, we propose backdoor detection from the noise space, introducing the first backdoor input detection approach for diffusion models and a novel model detection algorithm that calculates the KL divergence between reversed and benign distributions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TERD secures a 100% True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) across datasets of varying resolutions. TERD also demonstrates nice adaptability to other Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based models. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/TERD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized the selection of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms for use in the era of quantum computing. Despite their integration into TLS protocol for key establishment and signature generation, there is limited study on profiling these newly standardized algorithms in resource-constrained communication systems. In this work, we integrate PQC into both TLS servers and clients built upon embedded systems. Additionally, we compare the performance overhead of PQC pairs to currently used non-PQC schemes.</description>

      <title>CipherDM: Secure Three-Party Inference for Diffusion Model Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results in image generation and have been applied to various fields. However, DMs sometimes seriously violate user privacy during usage, making the protection of privacy an urgent issue. Using traditional privacy computing schemes like Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) directly in DMs faces significant computation and communication challenges. To address these issues, we propose CipherDM, the first novel, versatile and universal framework applying MPC technology to DMs for secure sampling, which can be widely implemented on multiple DM based tasks. We thoroughly analyze sampling latency breakdown, find time-consuming parts and design corresponding secure MPC protocols for computing nonlinear activations including SoftMax, SiLU and Mish. CipherDM is evaluated on popular architectures (DDPM, DDIM) using MNIST dataset and on SD deployed by diffusers. Compared to direct implementation on SPU, our approach improves running time by approximately 1.084\times \sim 2.328\times, and reduces communication costs by approximately 1.212\times \sim 1.791\times.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Miscompressions: Preparing Image Forensics for Neural Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural compression has the potential to revolutionize lossy image compression. Based on generative models, recent schemes achieve unprecedented compression rates at high perceptual quality but compromise semantic fidelity. Details of decompressed images may appear optically flawless but semantically different from the originals, making compression errors difficult or impossible to detect. We explore the problem space and propose a provisional taxonomy of miscompressions. It defines three types of 'what happens' and has a binary 'high impact' flag indicating miscompressions that alter symbols. We discuss how the taxonomy can facilitate risk communication and research into mitigations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quality Estimation of True Random Bit-streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating random bit streams is required in various applications, most notably cyber-security. Ensuring high-quality and robust randomness is crucial to mitigate risks associated with predictability and system compromise. True random numbers provide the highest unpredictability levels. However, potential biases in the processes exploited for the random number generation must be carefully monitored. This paper reports the implementation and characterization of an on-line procedure for the detection of anomalies in a true random bit stream. It is based on the NIST Adaptive Proportion and Repetition Count tests, complemented by statistical analysis relying on the Monobit and RUNS. The procedure is firmware implemented and performed simultaneously with the bit stream generation, and providing as well an estimate of the entropy of the source. The experimental validation of the approach is performed upon the bit streams generated by a quantum, silicon-based entropy source.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Differential Privacy Against Timing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard definition of differential privacy (DP) ensures that a mechanism's output distribution on adjacent datasets is indistinguishable. However, real-world implementations of DP can, and often do, reveal information through their runtime distributions, making them susceptible to timing attacks. In this work, we establish a general framework for ensuring differential privacy in the presence of timing side channels. We define a new notion of timing privacy, which captures programs that remain differentially private to an adversary that observes the program's runtime in addition to the output. Our framework enables chaining together component programs that are timing-stable followed by a random delay to obtain DP programs that achieve timing privacy. Importantly, our definitions allow for measuring timing privacy and output privacy using different privacy measures. We illustrate how to instantiate our framework by giving programs for standard DP computations in the RAM and Word RAM models of computation. Furthermore, we show how our framework can be realized in code through a natural extension of the OpenDP Programming Framework.</description>

Abstract: The ever-rising complexity of computer systems presents challenges for maintaining security and trust throughout their lifetime. As hardware forms the foundation of a secure system, we need tools and techniques that support computer hardware engineers to improve trust and help them address security concerns. This paper highlights a vision for tools and techniques to enhance the security of digital hardware in earlier stages of the digital design process, especially during design with hardware description languages. We discuss the challenges that design teams face and explore some recent literature on understanding, identifying, and mitigating hardware security weaknesses as early as possible. We highlight the opportunities that emerge with open-source hardware development and sketch some open questions that guide ongoing research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Training quantum machine learning model on cloud without uploading the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the linearity of quantum unitary operations, we propose a method that runs the parameterized quantum circuits before encoding the input data. It enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information of the data. It is also capable of encoding a huge number of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving the runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning model can be run completely on classical computers, so that the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, the method can mitigate the encoding bottom neck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $n/2$. These results manifest yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches for data security.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Security over Federated Learning via Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become one of the standard approaches for deploying machine learning models on edge devices, where private training data are distributed across clients, and a shared model is learned by aggregating locally computed updates from each client. While this paradigm enhances communication efficiency by only requiring updates at the end of each training epoch, the transmitted model updates remain vulnerable to malicious tampering, posing risks to the integrity of the global model. Although current digital signature algorithms can protect these communicated model updates, they fail to ensure quantum security in the era of large-scale quantum computing. Fortunately, various post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed to address this vulnerability, especially the three NIST-standardized algorithms - Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of these three NIST-standardized PQC algorithms for digital signatures within the FL procedure, covering a wide range of models, tasks, and FL settings. Our results indicate that Dilithium stands out as the most efficient PQC algorithm for digital signature in federated learning. Additionally, we offer an in-depth discussion of the implications of our findings and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Race/Ethnicity Estimation for Algorithmic Bias Measurement in the U.S</title>

Abstract: AI fairness measurements, including tests for equal treatment, often take the form of disaggregated evaluations of AI systems. Such measurements are an important part of Responsible AI operations. These measurements compare system performance across demographic groups or sub-populations and typically require member-level demographic signals such as gender, race, ethnicity, and location. However, sensitive member-level demographic attributes like race and ethnicity can be challenging to obtain and use due to platform choices, legal constraints, and cultural norms. In this paper, we focus on the task of enabling AI fairness measurements on race/ethnicity for \emph{U.S. LinkedIn members} in a privacy-preserving manner. We present the Privacy-Preserving Probabilistic Race/Ethnicity Estimation (PPRE) method for performing this task. PPRE combines the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) model, a sparse LinkedIn survey sample of self-reported demographics, and privacy-enhancing technologies like secure two-party computation and differential privacy to enable meaningful fairness measurements while preserving member privacy. We provide details of the PPRE method and its privacy guarantees. We then illustrate sample measurement operations. We conclude with a review of open research and engineering challenges for expanding our privacy-preserving fairness measurement capabilities.</description>

      <title>MILE: A Mutation Testing Framework of In-Context Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) has achieved notable success in the applications of large language models (LLMs). By adding only a few input-output pairs that demonstrate a new task, the LLM can efficiently learn the task during inference without modifying the model parameters. Such mysterious ability of LLMs has attracted great research interests in understanding, formatting, and improving the in-context demonstrations, while still suffering from drawbacks like black-box mechanisms and sensitivity against the selection of examples. In this work, inspired by the foundations of adopting testing techniques in machine learning (ML) systems, we propose a mutation testing framework designed to characterize the quality and effectiveness of test data for ICL systems. First, we propose several mutation operators specialized for ICL demonstrations, as well as corresponding mutation scores for ICL test sets. With comprehensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our framework in evaluating the reliability and quality of ICL test suites.

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Real-World Cyber-Physical Security using Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical control systems are critical infrastructures designed around highly responsive feedback loops that are measured and manipulated by hundreds of sensors and controllers. Anomalous data, such as from cyber-attacks, greatly risk the safety of the infrastructure and human operators. With recent advances in the quantum computing paradigm, the application of quantum in anomaly detection can greatly improve identification of cyber-attacks in physical sensor data. In this paper, we explore the use of strong pre-processing methods and a quantum-hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) that takes advantage of fidelity in parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently and effectively flatten extremely high dimensional data. Our results show an F-1 Score of 0.86 and accuracy of 87% on the HAI CPS dataset using an 8-qubit, 16-feature quantum kernel, performing equally to existing work and 14% better than its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Natias: Neuron Attribution based Transferable Image Adversarial Steganography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image steganography is a technique to conceal secret messages within digital images. Steganalysis, on the contrary, aims to detect the presence of secret messages within images. Recently, deep-learning-based steganalysis methods have achieved excellent detection performance. As a countermeasure, adversarial steganography has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to effectively deceive deep-learning-based steganalysis. However, steganalysts often employ unknown steganalytic models for detection. Therefore, the ability of adversarial steganography to deceive non-target steganalytic models, known as transferability, becomes especially important. Nevertheless, existing adversarial steganographic methods do not consider how to enhance transferability. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial steganographic scheme named Natias. Specifically, we first attribute the output of a steganalytic model to each neuron in the target middle layer to identify critical features. Next, we corrupt these critical features that may be adopted by diverse steganalytic models. Consequently, it can promote the transferability of adversarial steganography. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated with existing adversarial steganography frameworks. Thorough experimental analyses affirm that our proposed technique possesses improved transferability when contrasted with former approaches, and it attains heightened security in retraining scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Remote Control Painting System for Exterior Walls of High-Rise Buildings through Robotic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exterior painting of high-rise buildings is a challenging task. In our country, as well as in other countries of the world, this task is accomplished manually, which is risky and life-threatening for the workers. Researchers and industry experts are trying to find an automatic and robotic solution for the exterior painting of high-rise building walls. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem. We design and implement a prototype for automatically painting the building walls' exteriors. A spray mechanism was introduced in the prototype that can move in four different directions (up-down and left-right). All the movements are achieved by using microcontroller-operated servo motors. Further, these components create a scope to upgrade the proposed remote-controlled system to a robotic system in the future. In the presented system, all the operations are controlled remotely from a smartphone interface. Bluetooth technology is used for remote communications. It is expected that the suggested system will improve productivity with better workplace safety.</description>

      <title>Summarizing and Analyzing the Privacy-Preserving Techniques in Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies have been in existence for over a decade, prominently focusing on decentralized, pseudo-anonymous ledger-based transactions. Many protocol improvements and changes have resulted in new variants of Cryptocurrencies that are known for their peculiar characteristics. For instance, Storjcoin is a Proof-of-Storage-based Cryptocurrency that incentivizes its peers based on the amount of storage owned by them. Cryptocurrencies like Monero strive for user privacy by using privacy-centric cryptographic algorithms. While Cryptocurrencies strive to maintain peer transparency by making the transactions and the entire ledger public, user privacy is compromised at times. Monero and many other privacy-centric Cryptocurrencies have significantly improved from the original Bitcoin protocol after several problems were found in the protocol. Most of these deficiencies were related to the privacy of users. Even though Bitcoin claims to have pseudo-anonymous user identities, many attacks have managed to successfully de-anonymize users. In this paper, we present some well-known attacks and analysis techniques that have compromised the privacy of Bitcoin and many other similar Cryptocurrencies. We also analyze and study different privacy-preserving algorithms and the problems these algorithms manage to solve. Lastly, we touch upon the ethics, impact, legality, and acceptance of imposing these privacy algorithms.</description>

      <title>Getting a-Round Guarantees: Floating-Point Attacks on Certified Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10159v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial examples pose a security risk as they can alter decisions of a machine learning classifier through slight input perturbations. Certified robustness has been proposed as a mitigation where given an input $\mathbf{x}$, a classifier returns a prediction and a certified radius $R$ with a provable guarantee that any perturbation to $\mathbf{x}$ with $R$-bounded norm will not alter the classifier's prediction. In this work, we show that these guarantees can be invalidated due to limitations of floating-point representation that cause rounding errors. We design a rounding search method that can efficiently exploit this vulnerability to find adversarial examples against state-of-the-art certifications in two threat models, that differ in how the norm of the perturbation is computed. We show that the attack can be carried out against linear classifiers that have exact certifiable guarantees and against neural networks that have conservative certifications. In the weak threat model, our experiments demonstrate attack success rates over 50% on random linear classifiers, up to 23% on the MNIST dataset for linear SVM, and up to 15% for a neural network. In the strong threat model, the success rates are lower but positive. The floating-point errors exploited by our attacks can range from small to large (e.g., $10^{-13}$ to $10^{3}$) - showing that even negligible errors can be systematically exploited to invalidate guarantees provided by certified robustness. Finally, we propose a formal mitigation approach based on rounded interval arithmetic, encouraging future implementations of robustness certificates to account for limitations of modern computing architecture to provide sound certifiable guarantees.</description>

Abstract: The Tor Network has been a significant part of the Internet for years. Tor was originally started in the Naval Research Laboratory for anonymous Internet browsing and Internet-based communication. From being used for anonymous communications, it has now segmented into various other use-cases like censorship circumvention, performing illegal activities, etc. In this paper, we perform empirical measurements on the Tor network to analyze the trends in Tor over the years. We gather our measurements data through our measurement scripts, past research in this domain, and aggregated data provided by the Tor metrics directory. We use this data to analyze trends and understand the incidents that caused fluctuations in the trends of different data parameters. We collect measurements data for Tor parameters like Tor users, onion services, Tor relays, and bridges, etc. We also study censorshiprelated events and study trends by analyzing censorship-related metrics. Finally, we touch upon the location diversity in Tor and study how the Tor circuit selection and construction are impacted by the bandwidth distribution of Tor relays across geographies.</description>

      <title>INK: Inheritable Natural Backdoor Attack Against Model Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject malicious behavior through data poisoning and later exploit triggers to manipulate deployed models. To improve the stealth and effectiveness of backdoors, prior studies have introduced various imperceptible attack methods targeting both defense mechanisms and manual inspection. However, all poisoning-based attacks still rely on privileged access to the training dataset. Consequently, model distillation using a trusted dataset has emerged as an effective defense against these attacks. To bridge this gap, we introduce INK, an inheritable natural backdoor attack that targets model distillation. The key insight behind INK is the use of naturally occurring statistical features in all datasets, allowing attackers to leverage them as backdoor triggers without direct access to the training data. Specifically, INK employs image variance as a backdoor trigger and enables both clean-image and clean-label attacks by manipulating the labels and image variance in an unauthenticated dataset. Once the backdoor is embedded, it transfers from the teacher model to the student model, even when defenders use a trusted dataset for distillation. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the robustness of INK against transformation-based, search-based, and distillation-based defenses. For instance, INK maintains an attack success rate of over 98\% post-distillation, compared to an average success rate of 1.4\% for existing methods.</description>

      <title>DP-BREM: Differentially-Private and Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Client Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple participating clients to train machine learning models collaboratively while keeping their datasets local and only exchanging the gradient or model updates with a coordinating server. Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to attacks that aim to compromise data privacy and/or model robustness. Recently proposed defenses focused on ensuring either privacy or robustness, but not both. In this paper, we focus on simultaneously achieving differential privacy (DP) and Byzantine robustness for cross-silo FL, based on the idea of learning from history. The robustness is achieved via client momentum, which averages the updates of each client over time, thus reducing the variance of the honest clients and exposing the small malicious perturbations of Byzantine clients that are undetectable in a single round but accumulate over time. In our initial solution DP-BREM, DP is achieved by adding noise to the aggregated momentum, and we account for the privacy cost from the momentum, which is different from the conventional DP-SGD that accounts for the privacy cost from the gradient. Since DP-BREM assumes a trusted server (who can obtain clients' local models or updates), we further develop the final solution called DP-BREM+, which achieves the same DP and robustness properties as DP-BREM without a trusted server by utilizing secure aggregation techniques, where DP noise is securely and jointly generated by the clients. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed protocols achieve better privacy-utility tradeoff and stronger Byzantine robustness than several baseline methods, under different DP budgets and attack settings.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15910v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, known as \emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference attack'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.</description>

      <title>It Is Time To Steer: A Scalable Framework for Analysis-driven Attack Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attack Graph (AG) represents the best-suited solution to support cyber risk assessment for multi-step attacks on computer networks, although their generation suffers from poor scalability due to their combinatorial complexity. Current solutions propose to address the generation problem from the algorithmic perspective and postulate the analysis only after the generation is complete, thus implying too long waiting time before enabling analysis capabilities. Additionally, they poorly capture the dynamic changes in the networks due to long generation times. To mitigate these problems, this paper rethinks the classic AG analysis through a novel workflow in which the analyst can query the system anytime, thus enabling real-time analysis before the completion of the AG generation with quantifiable statistical significance. Further, we introduce a mechanism to accelerate the generation by steering it with the analysis query. To show the capabilities of the proposed framework, we perform an extensive quantitative validation and present a realistic case study on networks of unprecedented size. It demonstrates the advantages of our approach in terms of scalability and fitting to common attack path analyses.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Multi-bit Watermarking for AI-generated Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations.
  In this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of $97.6\%$, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves $49.2\%$. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting.</description>

      <title>Beyond Control: Exploring Novel File System Objects for Data-Only Attacks on Linux Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of control-flow integrity has propelled non-control data attacks into the mainstream. In the domain of OS kernel exploits, by corrupting critical non-control data, local attackers can directly gain root access or privilege escalation without hijacking the control flow. As a result, OS kernels have been restricting the availability of such non-control data. This forces attackers to continue to search for more exploitable non-control data in OS kernels. However, discovering unknown non-control data can be daunting because they are often tied heavily to semantics and lack universal patterns.
  We make two contributions in this paper: (1) discover critical non-control objects in the file subsystem and (2) analyze their exploitability. This work represents the first study, with minimal domain knowledge, to semi-automatically discover and evaluate exploitable non-control data within the file subsystem of the Linux kernel. Our solution utilizes a custom analysis and testing framework that statically and dynamically identifies promising candidate objects. Furthermore, we categorize these discovered objects into types that are suitable for various exploit strategies, including a novel strategy necessary to overcome the defense that isolates many of these objects. These objects have the advantage of being exploitable without requiring KASLR, thus making the exploits simpler and more reliable. We use 18 real-world CVEs to evaluate the exploitability of the file system objects using various exploit strategies. We develop 10 end-to-end exploits using a subset of CVEs against the kernel with all state-of-the-art mitigations enabled.</description>

      <title>iBA: Backdoor Attack on 3D Point Cloud via Reconstructing Itself</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing starkly contrasts with their susceptibility to security breaches, notably backdoor attacks. These attacks hijack DNNs during training, embedding triggers in the data that, once activated, cause the network to make predetermined errors while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. This vulnerability poses significant risks, especially given the insufficient research on robust defense mechanisms for 3D point cloud networks against such sophisticated threats. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic point cloud pre-processing methods, or rely on delicate manual design. Exploring simple, effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend triggers in 3D point clouds is still challenging.To address these challenges, we introduce MirrorAttack, a novel effective 3D backdoor attack method, which implants the trigger by simply reconstructing a clean point cloud with an auto-encoder. The data-driven nature of the MirrorAttack obviates the need for complex manual design. Minimizing the reconstruction loss automatically improves imperceptibility. Simultaneously, the reconstruction network endows the trigger with pronounced nonlinearity and sample specificity, rendering traditional preprocessing techniques ineffective in eliminating it. A trigger smoothing module based on spherical harmonic transformation is also attached to regulate the intensity of the attack.Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art ASR on different types of victim models with the intervention of defensive techniques. Moreover, the minimal perturbation introduced by our trigger, as assessed by various metrics, attests to the method's stealth, ensuring its imperceptibility.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across various domains, including chatbots and auto-task completion agents. However, these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and privacy leakage attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing quantization resource-constrained environments. This study investigates the impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building reliable and secure AI systems. We evaluate foundational models including Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.</description>

      <title>Goal-guided Generative Prompt Injection Attack on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. A large number of users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLMs model security challenges. Although there is currently a large amount of research on prompt injection attacks, most of these black-box attacks use heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these heuristic strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we redefine the goal of the attack: to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the adversarial text. Furthermore, we prove that maximizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the Mahalanobis distance between the embedded representation $x$ and $x'$ of the clean text and the adversarial text when the conditional probability is a Gaussian distribution and gives a quantitative relationship on $x$ and $x'$. Then we designed a simple and effective goal-guided generative prompt injection strategy (G2PIA) to find an injection text that satisfies specific constraints to achieve the optimal attack effect approximately. It is particularly noteworthy that our attack method is a query-free black-box attack method with low computational cost. Experimental results on seven LLM models and four datasets show the effectiveness of our attack method.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Open Edge Computing Platforms: Ecosystem, Usage, and Security Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging in recent years, open edge computing platforms (OECPs) claim large-scale edge nodes, the extensive usage and adoption, as well as the openness to any third parties to join as edge nodes. For instance, OneThingCloud, a major OECP operated in China, advertises 5 million edge nodes, 70TB bandwidth, and 1,500PB storage. However, little information is publicly available for such OECPs with regards to their technical mechanisms and involvement in edge computing activities. Furthermore, different from known edge computing paradigms, OECPs feature an open ecosystem wherein any third party can participate as edge nodes and earn revenue for the contribution of computing and bandwidth resources, which, however, can introduce byzantine or even malicious edge nodes and thus break the traditional threat model for edge computing. In this study, we conduct the first empirical study on two representative OECPs, which is made possible through the deployment of edge nodes across locations, the efficient and semi-automatic analysis of edge traffic as well as the carefully designed security experiments. As the results, a set of novel findings and insights have been distilled with regards to their technical mechanisms, the landscape of edge nodes, the usage and adoption, and the practical security/privacy risks. Particularly, millions of daily active edge nodes have been observed, which feature a wide distribution in the network space and the extensive adoption in content delivery towards end users of 16 popular Internet services. Also, multiple practical and concerning security risks have been identified along with acknowledgements received from relevant parties, e.g., the exposure of long-term and cross-edge-node credentials, the co-location with malicious activities of diverse categories, the failures of TLS certificate verification, the extensive information leakage against end users, etc.</description>

      <title>Decentralization of Ethereum's Builder Market</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains protect an ecosystem worth more than $500bn with strong security properties derived from the principle of decentralization. Is today's blockchain decentralized? In this paper, we empirically studied one of the least decentralized parts of Ethereum, its builder market.
  The builder market was introduced to fairly distribute Maximal Extractable Values (MEV) among validators and avoid validator centralization. As of the time of writing, three builders produced the vast majority (more than 80%) of blocks in Ethereum, creating a concerning centralization factor. However, the community believes that such centralization is okay, arguing that builder centralization will not lead to validator centralization. In this empirical study, we interrogate the causes and implications of builder centralization and challenge this belief that it is acceptable.
  Our main finding is that builder centralization has led to a significant loss by validators and, if left uncontrolled, could lead to validator centralization. Moreover, MEV mitigation solutions slated for adoption are affected too because they rely on the builder market as an MEV oracle, which is made inaccurate by centralization.
  Our investigation revealed two reasons behind builder centralization. We propose a structural change to the existing MEV supply chain and a solution based on the new supply chain structure. However, future work is required to analyze if the new supply chain structure is sustainable in the long term, which we leave open.</description>

      <title>Bi-Directional Transformers vs. word2vec: Discovering Vulnerabilities in Lifted Compiled Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities within compiled binaries is challenging due to lost high-level code structures and other factors such as architectural dependencies, compilers, and optimization options. To address these obstacles, this research explores vulnerability detection using natural language processing (NLP) embedding techniques with word2vec, BERT, and RoBERTa to learn semantics from intermediate representation (LLVM IR) code. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were trained on embeddings from encoders created using approximately 48k LLVM functions from the Juliet dataset. This study is pioneering in its comparison of word2vec models with multiple bidirectional transformer (BERT, RoBERTa) embeddings built using LLVM code to train neural networks to detect vulnerabilities in compiled binaries. word2vec Skip-Gram models achieved 92% validation accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, outperforming word2vec Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), BERT, and RoBERTa. This suggests that complex contextual embeddings may not provide advantages over simpler word2vec models for this task when a limited number (e.g. 48K) of data samples are used to train the bidirectional transformer-based models. The comparative results provide novel insights into selecting optimal embeddings for learning compiler-independent semantic code representations to advance machine learning detection of vulnerabilities in compiled binaries.</description>

      <title>Breaking Free: Efficient Multi-Party Private Set Union Without Non-Collusion Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocol enables $m$ $(m &gt; 2)$ parties, each holding a set, to collectively compute the union of their sets without revealing any additional information to other parties. There are two main categories of multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocols: The first category builds on public-key techniques, where existing works require a super-linear number of public-key operations, resulting in their poor practical efficiency. The second category builds on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques. The only work in this category, proposed by Liu and Gao (ASIACRYPT 2023), features the best concrete performance among all existing protocols, but still has super-linear computation and communication. Moreover, it does not achieve the standard semi-honest security, as it inherently relies on a non-collusion assumption, which is unlikely to hold in practice. There remains two significant open problems so far: no MPSU protocol achieves semi-honest security based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques, and no MPSU protocol achieves both linear computation and linear communication complexity. In this work, we resolve both of them. - We propose the first MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in the standard semi-honest model. This protocol is $3.9-10.0 \times$ faster than Liu and Gao in the LAN setting. Concretely, our protocol requires only $4.4$ seconds in online phase for 3 parties with sets of $2^{20}$ items each. - We propose the first MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, based on public-key operations. This protocol has the lowest overall communication costs and shows a factor of $3.0-36.5\times$ improvement in terms of overall communication compared to Liu and Gao.</description>

Abstract: Since ZMap's debut in 2013, networking and security researchers have used the open-source scanner to write hundreds of research papers that study Internet behavior. In addition, ZMap powers much of the attack-surface management and security ratings industries, and more than a dozen security companies have built products on top of ZMap. Behind the scenes, much of ZMap's behavior - ranging from its pseudorandom IP generation to its packet construction - has quietly evolved as we have learned more about how to scan the Internet. In this work, we quantify ZMap's adoption over the ten years since its release, describe its modern behavior (and the measurements that motivated those changes), and offer lessons from releasing and maintaining ZMap.</description>

      <title>Soft Prompts Go Hard: Steering Visual Language Models with Hidden Meta-Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of indirect injection attacks against language models that operate on images: hidden ''meta-instructions'' that influence how the model interprets the image and steer the model's outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view.
  We explain how to create meta-instructions by generating images that act as soft prompts. In contrast to jailbreaking attacks and adversarial examples, outputs produced in response to these images are plausible and based on the visual content of the image, yet also satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective.
  We evaluate the efficacy of meta-instructions for multiple visual language models and adversarial meta-objectives, and demonstrate how they can ''unlock'' capabilities of the underlying language models that are unavailable via explicit text instructions. We describe how meta-instruction attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of malicious, self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, and spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving their potential for addressing generative AI safety tasks largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework targeting generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with built-in safety filters. Atlas consists of two agents, namely the mutation agent and the selection agent, each comprising four key modules: a vision-language model (VLM) or LLM brain, planning, memory, and tool usage. The mutation agent uses its VLM brain to determine whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then collaborates iteratively with the LLM brain of the selection agent to generate new candidate jailbreak prompts with the highest potential to bypass the filter. In addition to multi-agent communication, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach to learn from past successes and failures, thereby enhancing Atlas's performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models equipped with multi-modal safety filters in a black-box setting. Additionally, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of generated images. This work convincingly demonstrates the successful application of LLM-based agents in studying the safety vulnerabilities of popular text-to-image generation models. We urge the community to consider advanced techniques like ours in response to the rapidly evolving text-to-image generation field.</description>

Abstract: We are releasing a new suite of security benchmarks for LLMs, CYBERSECEVAL 3, to continue the conversation on empirically measuring LLM cybersecurity risks and capabilities. CYBERSECEVAL 3 assesses 8 different risks across two broad categories: risk to third parties, and risk to application developers and end users. Compared to previous work, we add new areas focused on offensive security capabilities: automated social engineering, scaling manual offensive cyber operations, and autonomous offensive cyber operations. In this paper we discuss applying these benchmarks to the Llama 3 models and a suite of contemporaneous state-of-the-art LLMs, enabling us to contextualize risks both with and without mitigations in place.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Vulnerability of Large Language Models via Defense-Aware Architectural Backdoor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have long been recognized as vulnerable to backdoor attacks. By providing poisoned training data in the fine-tuning process, the attacker can implant a backdoor into the victim model. This enables input samples meeting specific textual trigger patterns to be classified as target labels of the attacker's choice. While such black-box attacks have been well explored in both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), backdoor attacks relying on white-box attack philosophy have hardly been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we take the first step to introduce a new type of backdoor attack that conceals itself within the underlying model architecture. Specifically, we propose to design separate backdoor modules consisting of two functions: trigger detection and noise injection. The add-on modules of model architecture layers can detect the presence of input trigger tokens and modify layer weights using Gaussian noise to disturb the feature distribution of the baseline model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our attack methods using two model architecture settings on five different large language datasets. We demonstrate that the training-free architectural backdoor on a large language model poses a genuine threat. Unlike the-state-of-art work, it can survive the rigorous fine-tuning and retraining process, as well as evade output probability-based defense methods (i.e. BDDR). All the code and data is available https://github.com/SiSL-URI/Arch_Backdoor_LLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel differentially private algorithm for online federated learning that employs temporally correlated noise to enhance utility while ensuring privacy of continuously released models. To address challenges posed by DP noise and local updates with streaming non-iid data, we develop a perturbed iterate analysis to control the impact of the DP noise on the utility. Moreover, we demonstrate how the drift errors from local updates can be effectively managed under a quasi-strong convexity condition. Subject to an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP budget, we establish a dynamic regret bound over the entire time horizon, quantifying the impact of key parameters and the intensity of changes in dynamic environments. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <title>Espresso: Robust Concept Filtering in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion based text-to-image models are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). We need concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in preventing the generation of images with unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously. We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). We configure CLIP to identify unacceptable concepts in generated images using the distance of their embeddings to the text embeddings of both unacceptable and acceptable concepts. This lets us fine-tune for robustness by separating the text embeddings of unacceptable and acceptable concepts while preserving their pairing with image embeddings for utility. We present a pipeline to evaluate various CRTs, attacks against them, and show that Espresso, is more effective and robust than prior CRTs, while retaining utility.</description>

      <title>Cross-Input Certified Training for Universal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing work in trustworthy machine learning primarily focuses on single-input adversarial perturbations. In many real-world attack scenarios, input-agnostic adversarial attacks, e.g. universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), are much more feasible. Current certified training methods train models robust to single-input perturbations but achieve suboptimal clean and UAP accuracy, thereby limiting their applicability in practical applications. We propose a novel method, CITRUS, for certified training of networks robust against UAP attackers. We show in an extensive evaluation across different datasets, architectures, and perturbation magnitudes that our method outperforms traditional certified training methods on standard accuracy (up to 10.3\%) and achieves SOTA performance on the more practical certified UAP accuracy metric.</description>

      <title>Comet: A Communication-efficient and Performant Approximation for Private Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalent use of Transformer-like models, exemplified by ChatGPT in modern language processing applications, underscores the critical need for enabling private inference essential for many cloud-based services reliant on such models. However, current privacy-preserving frameworks impose significant communication burden, especially for non-linear computation in Transformer model. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-in method Comet to effectively reduce the communication cost without compromising the inference performance. We second introduce an efficient approximation method to eliminate the heavy communication in finding good initial approximation. We evaluate our Comet on Bert and RoBERTa models with GLUE benchmark datasets, showing up to 3.9$\times$ less communication and 3.5$\times$ speedups while keep competitive model performance compared to the prior art.</description>

      <title>Injecting Undetectable Backdoors in Obfuscated Neural Networks and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As ML models become increasingly complex and integral to high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, they also become more susceptible to sophisticated adversarial attacks. We investigate the threat posed by undetectable backdoors, as defined in Goldwasser et al. (FOCS '22), in models developed by insidious external expert firms. When such backdoors exist, they allow the designer of the model to sell information on how to slightly perturb their input to change the outcome of the model.
  We develop a general strategy to plant backdoors to obfuscated neural networks, that satisfy the security properties of the celebrated notion of indistinguishability obfuscation. Applying obfuscation before releasing neural networks is a strategy that is well motivated to protect sensitive information of the external expert firm. Our method to plant backdoors ensures that even if the weights and architecture of the obfuscated model are accessible, the existence of the backdoor is still undetectable.
  Finally, we introduce the notion of undetectable backdoors to language models and extend our neural network backdoor attacks to such models based on the existence of steganographic functions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
  Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis.
  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other human experts to review the models and the former human experts' analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses.
  Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs as an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</description>

      <title>T2VSafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Text-to-Video Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.</description>

      <title>Private Heterogeneous Federated Learning Without a Trusted Server Revisited: Error-Optimal and Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Convex Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of federated learning (FL) with private data from people who do not trust the server or other silos/clients. In this context, every silo (e.g. hospital) has data from several people (e.g. patients) and needs to protect the privacy of each person's data (e.g. health records), even if the server and/or other silos try to uncover this data. Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP) prevents each silo's data from being leaked, by requiring that silo i's communications satisfy item-level differential privacy. Prior work arXiv:2106.09779 characterized the optimal excess risk bounds for ISRL-DP algorithms with homogeneous (i.i.d.) silo data and convex loss functions. However, two important questions were left open: (1) Can the same excess risk bounds be achieved with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data? (2) Can the optimal risk bounds be achieved with fewer communication rounds? In this paper, we give positive answers to both questions. We provide novel ISRL-DP FL algorithms that achieve the optimal excess risk bounds in the presence of heterogeneous silo data. Moreover, our algorithms are more communication-efficient than the prior state-of-the-art. For smooth loss functions, our algorithm achieves the optimal excess risk bound and has communication complexity that matches the non-private lower bound. Additionally, our algorithms are more computationally efficient than the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</description>
