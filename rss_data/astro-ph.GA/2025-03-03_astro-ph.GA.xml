      <title>Aeos: The Impact of Pop III Initial Mass Function and Star-by-Star Models in Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of variations in the Population III (Pop III) initial mass function (IMF) and star-by-star feedback on early galaxy formation and evolution using the Aeos simulations. We compare simulations with two different Pop III IMFs: $M_\text{char} = 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 100 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos10) and $M_\text{char} = 20 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 300 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos20). Aeos20 produces significantly more ionizing photons, ionizing 30% of the simulation volume by $z \approx 14$, compared to 9% in Aeos10. This enhanced ionization suppresses galaxy formation on the smallest scales. Differences in Pop III IMF also affect chemical enrichment. Aeos20 produces Population II (Pop II) stars with higher abundances, relative to iron, of light and $\alpha$-elements, a stronger odd-even effect, and a higher frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. The abundance scatter between different Pop II galaxies dominates the differences due to Pop III IMF, though, implying a need for a larger sample of Pop II stars to interpret the impact of Pop III IMF on early chemical evolution. We also compare the Aeos simulations to traditional simulations that use single stellar population particles. We find that star-by-star modeling produces a steeper mass-metallicity relation due to less bursty feedback. These results highlight the strong influence of the Pop III IMF on early galaxy formation and chemical evolution, emphasizing the need to account for IMF uncertainties in simulations and the importance of metal-poor Pop II stellar chemical abundances when studying the first stars.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). II. The age-metallicity relation of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the age determination of 13 globular clusters dynamically associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger event, as part of the CARMA project effort to trace the Milky Way assembly history. We used deep and homogeneous archival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ data, and applied isochrone-fitting to derive homogeneous age estimates. We find that the majority of the selected clusters form a well-defined age-metallicity relation, with a few outliers. Among these, NGC 288 and NGC 6205 are more than 2 Gyr older than the other GSE globular clusters at similar metallicity, and are therefore interpreted as of likely in-situ origin. Moreover, NGC 7099 is somewhat younger than the average GSE trend, this suggesting a possible alternative dwarf galaxy progenitor, while NGC 5286 is mildly older, as if its progenitor was characterised by an higher star-formation efficiency. Another remarkable feature of the resulting age-metallicity relation is the presence of two epochs of globular cluster formation, with a duration of $\sim0.3$ Gyr each and separated by $\sim2$ Gyr. These findings are in excellent agreement with the age-metallicity relation of halo field stars found by Gonz\'alez-Koda et al., clearly hinting at episodic star-formation in GSE. The age of the two formation epochs is similar to the mean age of the two groups of in-situ globular clusters previously studied by CARMA. These epochs might therefore be precisely pinpointing two important dynamical events that GSE had with the Milky Way during its evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the correlation between the recent determination of Si and Eu with the clusters age and origin.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia colour-magnitude diagram fitting (ChronoGal) -- III. Age and metallicity distribution of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus stars near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is considered the last major merger that contributed to the formation of the Milky Way. Its remnants dominate the nearby accreted stellar halo of the Milky Way. Aim. We aim to characterise the star formation history of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus through the age and metallicity of its stellar populations. Methods. From Gaia DR3 data, we dynamically define three Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus samples with different criteria and possible degrees of contamination from other substructures in the halo. Then, we derive the stellar age and metallicity distributions using the CMDfit.Gaia package. Results. We identify three main populations of stars and a fourth smaller one following an almost linear age-[M/H] relation. The three oldest populations correspond to the bulk of the star formation that lasted for, at least, $\sim$3-4 Gyr and ended about 10 Gyr ago, its metallicities ranging from $-$1.7 to $-$0.8. We categorise these populations into two main epochs: the evolution of GSE in isolation and the merger event. This separation finds independent support from the age-metallicty relation of GSE globular clusters (Aguado-Agelet et al., subm.). The fourth population is younger and more metal-rich, at $\sim$8.5 Gyr and [M/H]$\sim-0.4$; its link to GSE is unclear.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origins I: Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>JWST + ALMA ubiquitously discover companion systems within $\lesssim18\,$kpc around four $z$$\approx$3.5 luminous radio-loud AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers play important roles in galaxy evolution at and beyond Cosmic Noon ($z\sim3$). They are found to be a trigger of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and a process for growing stellar mass and black hole mass. High-$z$ radio galaxies (HzRGs=type-2 radio-loud AGN) are among the most massive galaxies known, and reside in dense environments on scales of tens of kiloparsecs to Megaparsecs. We present the first search for kpc-scale companions in a sample of four $z\sim3.5$ HzRGs, with many supporting datasets, using matched 0.2" resolution ALMA and JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit data. We discover a total of $\sim12$ companion systems within $\lesssim18\,$kpc across all four HzRG fields using two independent detection methods: peculiar [OIII]$4959,5007$ kinematics offset from the main (systemic) ionized gas component and [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ emitters. We examine the velocity fields of these companions and find evidence of disk rotation along with more complex motions. We estimate the dynamical masses of these nearby systems to be $M_{\rm dyn}\sim10^{9-11}\,M_{\odot}$, which may indicate a minor merger scenario. Our results indicate that these companions may be the trigger of the powerful radio-loud AGN. We discuss the roles of the discovered companion systems in galaxy evolution for these powerful jetted AGN and indicate that they may impede jet launch and deflect the jet.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing orbits of galaxies in extreme regions (ROGER). IV. Unveiling galaxy evolution patterns in OmegaWINGS clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies have proven to be efficient systems in modifying various properties of galaxies, such as star formation or morphology. However, projection effects impose serious challenges in determining how, when, and to what extent galaxies are affected by the cluster environment. Using innovative techniques to classify galaxies based on their history within the cluster, we aim to determine how galaxies of different classes are affected by the cluster environment. We applied the ROGER code to select trajectories of galaxies in the phase space for 35 galaxy clusters from the OmegaWINGS survey. A new algorithm was applied to minimize contamination effects. We found that both morphological transformation and the quenching of star formation begin shortly after galaxies enter the cluster. Even though over the last $2-3$ Gyr, galaxies entering clusters have undergone significant transformations in both their star formation and morphology these transformation processes are not complete, that is, they are not completely quenched and are not early type yet. Backsplash galaxies and recent infallers show a higher fraction of jellyfish galaxies compared to older cluster members, suggesting that the timescale of this phenomenon is typically less than 3 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Classifying spectra of emission-line regions with neural networks -- An application to integral field spectroscopic data of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission-line regions are key to understanding the properties of galaxies, as they trace the exchange of matter and energy between stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). In nearby galaxies, individual nebulae can be identified as HII regions, planetary nebulae (PNe), supernova remnants (SNR), and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) with criteria on single or multiple emission-line ratios. However, these methods are limited by rigid classification boundaries, the narrow scope of information they are based upon, and the inability to account for line-of-sight nebular superpositions. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to classify these regions using their optical spectra. Our training set consists of simulated spectra, obtained from photoionisation and shock models, and processed to match observations obtained with MUSE. We evaluate the performance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise (S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae along the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect predictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy declines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\alpha$)=20. We apply our model to real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a robust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII regions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas, while identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's classification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement. Using activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly relies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination lines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively emulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in virtual: I. Thermodynamic perspective of the $\sigma^2$-M relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon of physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). We present a thermodynamic perspective on turbulence, aiming to explain the origin of the variance (\(\sigma^2\)) of the lognormal probability density function (PDF) of gas density caused by turbulence. By introducing a virtual dissipation process, in which the entropy-increasing processes of turbulent dissipation and structural dissipation are assumed to be coupled, we directly derive the empirical relation between the variance of the (near) log-normal PDF ($\sigma^2$) and the Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$): $\sigma^2 = \ln(1 + b^2\mathcal{M})^2$. We also explain why $b = 1$ for compressive forcing and $b = 1/D$ for solenoidal forcing, where $D$ is the dimension of the system. Furthermore, by introducing a delay parameter $q$ for the local gas temperature, we quantitatively derive the deviation of $\sigma^2$ from the empirical relation at high $\mathcal{M}$, which is consistent with previous simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VII. Galactic Center Regions Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the mid-infrared properties of Giant HII (GHII) regions in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- using SOFIA-FORCAST imaging at 25 and 37 microns. It compares these mid-infrared data with previous multi-wavelength observations to explore their present star formation activity and global properties. The study identifies 77 massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions. Sgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than the other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the mid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr B1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has fewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young stellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground stars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the Galactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific present star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr B1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas, suggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid dynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII regions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper stars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1 and Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially representing a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification as GHII regions.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: A z=6 Quasar in a Train-Wreck Galaxy Merger System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy observations of the z=5.89 quasar NDWFS J1425+3254 from 0.6-5.3 microns, covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical at spectral resolution R~100. The quasar has a black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}=(1.4\substack{+3.1\\-1.0})\times10^9 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio $L_{\rm{Bol}}/L_{\rm{Edd}}=0.3\substack{+0.6\\-0.2}$, as implied from the broad Balmer H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. We find that the quasar host has significant ongoing obscured star formation, as well as a quasar-driven outflow with velocity $6050\substack{+460\\-630}$ km/s, possibly one of the most extreme outflows in the early Universe. The data also reveals that two companion galaxies are merging with the quasar host. The north-eastern companion galaxy is relatively old and very massive, with luminosity-weighted stellar age $65\substack{+9\\-4}$ Myr, stellar mass $(3.6\substack{+0.6\\-0.3})\times10^{11} M_\odot$, and SFR $&lt; (16.1\pm1.9) M_\odot$/yr. A bridge of gas connects this companion galaxy and the host, confirming their ongoing interaction. A second merger is occurring between the quasar host and a much younger companion galaxy to the south, with stellar age $6.7\pm1.8$ Myr, stellar mass $(1.9\pm0.4)\times10^{10} M_\odot$, and SFR $&lt; (93\substack{+17\\-16}) M_\odot$/yr. There is also another galaxy in the field that is likely in the foreground at z=1.135, that could be gravitationally lensing the quasar with magnification $1&lt;\mu&lt;2$, and so &lt;0.75 mag. Overall, the system is a "train-wreck" merger of three galaxies, with star formation and extreme quasar activity that were likely triggered by these ongoing interactions.</description>

      <title>On the Extremely X-ray Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the XMM-LSS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of extremely X-ray variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the $\approx 5.3~{\rm deg}^2$ XMM-SERVS XMM-LSS region. Eight variable AGNs are identified with rest-frame 2 keV flux density variability amplitudes around 6-12. We comprehensively analyze the X-ray and multiwavelength data to probe the origin of their extreme X-ray variability. It is found that their extreme X-ray variability can be ascribed to changing accretion state or changing obscuration from dust-free absorbers. For five AGNs, their X-ray variability is attributed to changing accretion state, supported by contemporaneous multiwavelength variability and the absence of X-ray absorption in the low-state spectra. With new Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra for four of these sources, we confirm one changing-look AGN. One MMT AGN lacks multi-epoch spectroscopic observations, while the other two AGNs do not exhibit changing-look behavior, likely because the MMT observations did not capture their high states. The X-ray variability of the other three AGNs is explained by changing obscuration, and they show only mild long-term optical/IR variability. The absorbers of these sources are likely clumpy accretion-disk winds, with variable column densities and covering factors along the lines of sight.</description>

      <title>Kinematical Modeling of the Resolved Stellar Outskirts of M32: Constraints on Tidal Stripping Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the only compact elliptical close enough to resolve into individual stars, the satellite dwarf galaxy M32 provides a unique opportunity for exploring the origins of such rare galaxies. In this work, we combined archival and novel Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy from a southern extension of the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey with optical HST imaging from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST) survey. The resulting sample of 2525 giant stars is unprecedented both in size and spatial coverage (0.9-15.5 arcmin, or out to $\sim$23$r_{\rm eff}$ and $\sim$30$r_{\rm eff}$ along M32's major and minor axes) for probing the resolved stellar outskirts of M32. Given the structurally complex region near M32 on the sky, we modeled M32's line-of-sight kinematics simultaneously alongside M31's rotating stellar disk and potential outliers corresponding to M31's kinematically hot stellar halo and/or tidal substructure. Inside the radius corresponding to the observed twisting of isophotal contours in M32's surface brightness profile ($R_{\rm iso} \sim$ 5$r_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 150'' or 0.56 kpc), M32 exhibits a line-of-sight velocity distribution characteristic of ordered rotation, transitioning to a distribution with heavier outliers beyond this radius. Within $R_{\rm iso}$, the rotational direction is aligned with M32's major-axis rotation, but shifts to become roughly aligned with M32's minor axis beyond $R_{\rm iso}$. We interpret these kinematical signatures in the stellar outskirts of M32 as evidence of tidal distortion from interactions with M31 and discuss their implications for M32 formation pathways.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced HCNH+ abundance enhancement in the heart of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 unveiled by ALCHEMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the chemistry of molecular clouds is pivotal to elucidate star formation and galaxy evolution. As one of the important molecular ions, HCNH+ plays an important role in this chemistry. Yet, its behavior and significance under extreme conditions, such as in the CMZs of external galaxies, are still largely unexplored. We aim to reveal the physical and chemical properties of the CMZ in the starburst galaxy NGC253 with multiple HCNH+ transitions to shed light on the molecule's behavior under the extreme physical conditions of a starburst. We employ molecular line data including results for four rotational transitions of HCNH+ from the ALCHEMI large program to investigate underlying physical and chemical processes. Despite weak intensities, HCNH+ emission is widespread throughout NGC253's CMZ, which suggests that this molecular ion can effectively trace large-scale structures within molecular clouds. Using the quantum mechanical coupled states approximation, we computed rate coefficients for collisions of HCNH+ with para-H2 and ortho-H2 at kinetic temperatures up to 500 K. Using these coefficients in a non-LTE modeling framework and employing a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis, we find that HCNH+ emission originates from regions with H2 number densities of $\sim10^{2.80}-10^{3.55}$~cm$^{-3}$, establishing HCNH+ as a tracer of low-density environments. Our analysis reveals that most of the HCNH+ abundances in the CMZ of NGC253 are higher than all reported values in the Milky Way. We performed static, PDR, and shock modeling, and found that recurrent shocks could potentially account for the elevated HCNH+ abundances observed in this CMZ. We propose that the unexpectedly high HCNH+ abundances may result from chemical enhancement, primarily driven by the elevated gas temperatures and cosmic ray ionization rates of shocked, low-density gas in the nuclear starburst regions of NGC253.</description>

      <title>Detection of the 2175{\AA} UV Bump at z&gt;7: Evidence for Rapid Dust Evolution in a Merging Reionisation-Era Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) within galaxies, as dust grains are highly efficient absorbers of UV and optical photons. Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the 2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z~7 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust attenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1{\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides evidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>When Is a Bulge Not a Bulge? Revealing the Satellite Nature of NGC 5474's Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A satellite galaxy of the nearby spiral M101, NGC 5474 has a prominent bulge offset from the kinematic center of the underlying star-forming disk that has gained attention in recent years. Recent studies have proposed that this putative offset bulge is not a classical bulge within the plane of the disk but instead a dwarf companion galaxy along the line-of-sight. Using integral field spectroscopy data taken as part of the PPak IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey (PINGS), we perform the first analysis of the stellar and gas kinematics of this putative bulge and portions of the disk. We find a radial velocity offset of ~24 km/s between the emission lines produced by the disk HII regions and the absorption lines produced by the putative bulge stellar component. We interpret this velocity offset as evidence that the putative bulge and disk are two separate objects, the former orbiting around the latter, supporting simulations and observations of this peculiar system. We attempt to place this external companion into the context of the M101 Group and the M101-NGC 5474 interaction.</description>

      <title>Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Full-sky Models of Galactic Microwave Emission and Polarization at Sub-arcminute Scales for the Python Sky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized foreground emission from the Galaxy is one of the biggest challenges facing current and upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments. We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints, that employ the ``polarization fraction tensor'' framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way, and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at sub-arcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model (PySM) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.</description>

      <title>Simple molecules and complex chemistry in a protoplanetary disk: A JWST investigation of the highly inclined disk d216-0939</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.</description>

      <title>A MOND model applied to the rotation curve of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Newton dynamics (MOND) model to study the rotation curves of galaxies. The model is described by an arctangent interpolating function and it fits the rotation curves of several galaxies without invoking the presence of dark matter. We took from the literature the rotation curve data of fifteen spiral galaxies, and used it to constrain the model parameter, $a_0$, as around $5\times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. This parameter is also called the acceleration constant once it gives the acceleration scale where Newton's dynamics fails. The model can be further tested in different astrophysical scenarios, such as, the missing mass problem of galaxy clusters and the accelerated expansion of the Universe, thus leading to a more robust and well constrained model.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Color-Magnitude Relation of M Giants by Using Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M giants, with their distinctive properties such as high luminosity, serve as excellent indicators for mapping the structure of the Milky Way. The distance to distant M giants can be determined by using the color-magnitude relation (CMR), which is derived from color-magnitude diagrams of specific systems in previous studies. In this work, we aimed to achieve more accurate distance determination for M giants by focusing on open clusters (OCs) with a large number of member stars and thus improve the CMR. For the first time, we compiled a census of OCs harboring M giants using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 9. We identified 58 M giants associated with 43 OCs and obtained their astrometric and photometric parameters from Gaia DR3. Using the distances of these OCs, we derived the CMR for M giants as a linear correlation, expressed as $M_{Ks}=3.85-8.26(J-K_s$). This linear relation proved superior to the empirical distance relation in characterizing the CMR of M giants. The photometric distances of M giants derived from the CMR are consistent with the parallax distances from Gaia and known spectroscopic distances, with median deviations of 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the distances of M giants derived from the CMR, we computed their radial velocity ($V_R$), azimuthal velocity ($V{\phi}$), and vertical velocity ($V_Z$), respectively. The distributions of these velocities revealed key features of the Galactic disk, including oscillation, north-south rotational asymmetry, and warp. These findings are consistent with previous studies and further validate the reliability of the derived CMR.</description>

      <title>New submillimetre HCN lasers in carbon-rich evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong laser emission from hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 805 and 891 GHz has been discovered towards carbon-rich (C-rich) AGB stars, originating from the Coriolis-coupled system between two (1,1^{1e},0) and (0,4^0,0) vibrational states. However, other lines (at 894, 964, 968 and 1055 GHz) in this system remained unexplored due to observational challenges. Using SOFIA/4GREAT observations and Herschel/HIFI archival data, we analyzed the six HCN transitions in eight C-rich AGB stars. We report new HCN transitions show laser action at 964, 968, and 1055 GHz. The 805, 891, and 964 GHz lasers were detected in seven C-rich stars, the 968 GHz laser in six, and the 1055 GHz laser in five, while the 894 GHz line was not detected in any target. Among the detected lasers, the 891 GHz laser is always the strongest, and the 964 GHz laser, like a twin of the 891 GHz line, is the second strongest. Towards IRC+10216, all five HCN laser transitions were observed in six to eight epochs and exhibited significant variations in line profiles and intensities. The cross-ladder lines at 891 and 964 GHz exhibit similar variations, and their intensity changes do not follow the near-infrared light curve (i.e. non-periodic variations). In contrast, the variations of the rotational lines at 805, 968, and 1055 GHz appear to be quasi-periodic, with a phase lag of 0.1 - 0.2 relative to the near-infrared light curve. A comparative analysis indicates that these HCN lasers may be seen as analogues to vibrationally excited SiO and water masers in oxygen-rich stars. We suggest chemical pumping and radiative pumping could play an important role in the production of the cross-ladder HCN lasers, while the quasi-periodic behavior of the rotational HCN laser lines may be modulated by additional collisional and radiative pumping driven by periodic shocks and variations in infrared luminosity.

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation III. Fast rotators and new FGK stars in the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample</title>

Abstract: The next mission dedicated to the study of planetary atmospheres is the Ariel space mission, planned for launch in 2029, which will observe a variety of planetary systems belonging to different classes around stars with spectral types from M to A. To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such stars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus on a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of FGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which exhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars, with either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in our previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure consistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with the spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results of our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived parameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they belong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar parameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars in total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the correlations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS analysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to 1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower metallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more metal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are also found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant planets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.</description>

      <title>Target Selection for the Redshift-Limited WAVES-Wide with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming Wide Area Vista Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) has a key science goal of probing the halo mass function to lower limits than possible with previous surveys. For that purpose, in its Wide component, galaxies targetted by WAVES will be flux-limited to $Z&lt;21.1$ mag and will cover the redshift range of $z&lt;0.2$, at a spectroscopic success rate of $\sim95\%$. Meeting this completeness requirement, when the redshift is unknown a priori, is a challenge. We solve this problem with supervised machine learning to predict the probability of a galaxy falling within the WAVES-Wide redshift limit, rather than estimate each object's redshift. This is done by training an XGBoost tree-based classifier to decide if a galaxy should be a target or not. Our photometric data come from 9-band VST+VISTA observations, including KiDS+VIKING surveys. The redshift labels for calibration are derived from an extensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with KiDS and ancillary fields. Our current results indicate that with our approach, we should be able to achieve the completeness of $\sim95\%$, which is the WAVES success criterion.</description>

      <title>Tracing Chemical Depletion in Evolved Binaries Hosting Second-Generation Transition Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms responsible for chemical depletion across diverse astrophysical environments are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we investigate chemical depletion in post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosting second-generation transition discs using high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT. We performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 6 post-AGB/post-RGB stars and 6 post-AGB/post-RGB candidates with transition discs in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained through 1D LTE analysis of chemical elements from C to Eu, and 1D NLTE corrections were incorporated for elements from C to Fe. Our results confirmed that depletion efficiency, traced by the [S/Ti] abundance ratio, is higher in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs compared to the overall sample of post-AGB/post-RGB binaries. We also examined correlations between derived abundances and binary system parameters (astrometric, photometric, orbital, pulsational). Additionally, we compared the depletion patterns in our sample to those observed in young stars with transition discs and in the interstellar medium. We confirmed that the depletion is significantly stronger in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs than in young stars with transition discs. Furthermore, we found that [X/Zn] abundance ratio trends of volatile and refractory elements in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs generally resemble similar trends in the interstellar medium (except for trends of [Si/Zn] and [Mg/Zn] ratios). These findings, although based on a limited sample, provide indirect constraints for depletion mechanism in circumbinary discs around post-AGB/post-RGB stars.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.</description>

      <title>No evidence for anisotropy in galaxy spin directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary Z-wise/S-wise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We similarly identify no evidence for a "hemisphere anisotropy" that neglects the angular dependence of the dipole. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: JWST/NIRSpec IFS view of the z~3.5 galaxy GS5001 and its close environment at the core of a large-scale overdensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec observations in IFS mode of the galaxy GS5001 at redshift z=3.47, the central member of a candidate protocluster in the GOODS-S field. The data cover a field of view (FoV) of 4''$\times$4'' (~$30\times30$~kpc$^2$) and were obtained as part of the GA-NIFS GTO program. The observations include both high (R~2700) and low (R~100) spectral resolution data, spanning the rest-frame wavelength ranges 3700-6780A and 1300-11850A, respectively. We analyse the spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics and interstellar medium properties, including obscuration, gas metallicity, excitation, ionisation parameter, and electron density. In addition to the main galaxy (GS5001), the NIRSpec FoV covers three components in the south, with velocities blue-shifted by -150 km/s with respect to the main galaxy, and another source in the north redshifted by ~200 km/s. Optical line ratio diagnostics indicate star formation ionisation and electron densities of ~500 cm$^{-3}$ across all sources in the FoV. The gas-phase metallicity in the main galaxy is 12+log(O/H) $= 8.45\pm0.04$, and slightly lower in the companions (12+log(O/H)$ = 8.34-8.42$), consistent with the mass-metallicity relation at $z\sim3$. We find peculiar line ratios (high log [NII]/H$\alpha$, low log [OIII]/H$\beta$) in the northern part of GS5001. These could be attributed to either higher metallicity, or to shocks resulting from the interaction of the main galaxy with the northern source. We identify a spatially resolved outflow in the main galaxy, with an extension of about 3 kpc. We find maximum outflow velocities of ~400 km/s, an outflow mass of $(1.7\pm0.4)\times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$, a mass outflow rate of $23\pm5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a mass loading factor of 0.23. These properties are compatible with star formation being the driver of the outflow.</description>

      <title>Narrow line AGN selection in CEERS: spectroscopic selection, physical properties, X-ray and radio analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) among the $\sim 300$ publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the CEERS Survey. Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGN at $2\lesssim z\lesssim 9$ on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified 4 new $z\lesssim 2$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN), in addition to the 8 previously reported high-$z$ BLAGN. We found that the traditional BPT diagnostic diagrams are not suited to identify high-$z$ AGN, while most of the high-$z$ NLAGN are selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration of the sample of NLAGN with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGN heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies' physical properties, as further confirmed by SED-fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-$z$ NLAGNs selected in this work are well below those sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGN. Finally, we investigate the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGN and of the sample of high-$z$ BLAGN. We find that all but 4 NLAGN are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-$z$ BLAGN. We do not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of $\sim 1-2$ dex from what is expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection leaving open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>Reviewing the GR Method for Estimating Black Hole Parameters of Megamaser Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review a General Relativistic (GR) method to determine the black hole (BH) parameters: mass-to-distance ratio, position and recessional velocity of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of Seyfert type, which have an accretion disk with water masers circulating around the BH. This GR method makes use of astrophysical observations: the redshifted and the blueshifted photons emitted from the aforementioned masers and their orbital position on the sky. In order to perform the estimations we implement a Bayesian statistical method to fit the above mentioned observational data. One of the main results of this work consists in analytically expressing the gravitational redshift, allowing us to quantify its magnitude for the photons emitted by the closest masers to the black holes. We present this quantity for several BHs hosted at the core of AGNs.</description>

      <title>Predicting High-magnification Events in Microlensed Quasars in the Era of LSST using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming widefield surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will monitor thousands of strongly lensed quasars over a 10 yr period. Many of these monitored quasars will undergo high-magnification events (HMEs) through microlensing, as the accretion disk crosses a caustic, places of infinite magnification. Microlensing allows us to map the inner regions of the accretion disk as it crosses a caustic, even at large cosmological distances. The observational cadences of LSST are not ideal for probing the inner regions of the accretion disk, so there is a need to predict HMEs as early as possible, to trigger high-cadence multiband or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Here, we simulate a diverse and realistic sample of 10 yr quasar microlensing light curves to train a recurrent neural network to predict HMEs before they occur, by classifying the locations of the peaks at each time step. This is the first deep-learning approach for predicting HMEs. We give estimates of how well we expect to predict HME peaks during LSST and benchmark how our metrics change with different cadence strategies. With LSST-like observations, we can predict approximately 55% of HME peaks, corresponding to tens to hundreds per year and a false-positive rate of around 20% compared to the total number of HMEs. Our network can be continuously applied throughout the LSST survey, providing crucial alerts for optimizing follow-up resources.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVIII: The assembly of a star cluster: Dense N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) kinematics in the massive G351.77 protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ALMA-IMF observed 15 massive protoclusters capturing multiple spectral lines and the continuum emission. We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\sim$ 2500 M$_{\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2 kpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at $\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\sim (1.7 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to two velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense gas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we observe clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The most prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\sim 13.5 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\sim$ 11.4 kyr. We also observe V-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of accretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be viable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\sim$ 4 kau scales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated into 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and H$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with rotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the suggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas depletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring either very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the protocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming out of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently published work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions inferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to protoclusters.</description>

      <title>Kinetic tomography of the Galactic plane within 1.25 kiloparsecs from the Sun. The interstellar flows revealed by HI and CO line emission and 3D dust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$. We used the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method, a computer vision technique for evaluating the morphological correlation between images, to match the plane-of-the-sky dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identified a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employed this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 10.8 and 6.6 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities corresponding to these streaming motions are around 0.11 and 0.04 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition in the local ISM. Yet, we identify energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the local spiral arm's impact on these energy overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution and dynamics in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893</link>

Abstract: We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals thermal and non-thermal desorption of methanol ice in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from $14.6^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters in a IllustrisTNG simulation based on mock observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitational systems in the Universe. They are valuable probes of the structure growth of the Universe when we estimate their peculiar velocities with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects. We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the true velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects in seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses in TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ effect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to overestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether they approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than 500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\rm z,kSZ}$ and the real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\rm z,halo}$) were consistent with unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for observational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different precipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity within the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher observation noise. The $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious trend with increasing concentration and $M_{\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that the $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters with strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates. This indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state and may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Self-similar decomposition of the hierarchical merger tree of dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.</description>
