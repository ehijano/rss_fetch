      <title>Techno-economic environmental and social assessment framework for energy transition pathways in integrated energy communities: a case study in Alaska</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive evaluation tools that account for technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum of impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental, and social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways. The framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure needs, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts, offering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its applicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is conducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition pathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource coordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that coordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and reduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based analysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil heating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by 29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for economic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment framework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.</description>

      <title>Safe Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of control systems, model predictive control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable potential; however, its reliance on accurate models and substantial computational resources has hindered its broader application, especially within real-time nonlinear systems. This study presents an innovative control framework to enhance the practical viability of the MPC. The developed safe data-driven predictive control aims to eliminate the requirement for precise models and alleviate computational burdens in the nonlinear MPC (NMPC). This is achieved by learning both the system dynamics and the control policy, enabling efficient data-driven predictive control while ensuring system safety. The methodology involves a spatial temporal filter (STF)-based concurrent learning for system identification, a robust control barrier function (RCBF) to ensure the system safety amid model uncertainties, and a RCBF-based NMPC policy approximation. An online policy correction mechanism is also introduced to counteract performance degradation caused by the existing model uncertainties. Demonstrated through simulations on two applications, the proposed approach offers comparable performance to existing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Dubins Vehicle in the Presence of Loss of Effectiveness (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of a Dubins Vehicle when subjected to a loss of control effectiveness is considered. A complex state-space representation is used to model the vehicle dynamics. An adaptive control design is proposed, with the underlying stability analysis guaranteeing closed-loop boundedness and tracking of a desired path. It is shown that a path constructed by waypoints and a minimum turn radius can be specified using a reference model which can be followed by the closed loop system. The control design utilizes the complex representation as well as a PID controller for the nominal closed-loop. How the design can be modified to ensure that the control input does not saturate is also discussed. Simulation studies are carried out to complement the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Autonomous Vehicle Safety: A Combined Fault Tree Analysis and Bayesian Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Bayesian Networks (BN) to assess collision risk and establish Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) B failure rate targets for critical autonomous vehicle (AV) components. The FTA-BN integration combines the systematic decomposition of failure events provided by FTA with the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of BN, which allow for dynamic updates in failure probabilities, enhancing the adaptability of risk assessment. A fault tree is constructed based on AV subsystem architecture, with collision as the top event, and failure rates are assigned while ensuring the total remains within 100 FIT. Bayesian inference is applied to update posterior probabilities, and the results indicate that perception system failures (46.06 FIT) are the most significant contributor, particularly failures to detect existing objects (PF5) and misclassification (PF6). Mitigation strategies are proposed for sensors, perception, decision-making, and motion control to reduce the collision risk. The FTA-BN integration approach provides dynamic risk quantification, offering system designers refined failure rate targets to improve AV safety.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the rising integration of renewable energy sources and the need for more adaptive control strategies. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to power network control (PNC), offering the potential to enhance decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have played a key role in accelerating research by providing standardized benchmarks and problem formulations, leading to rapid advancements in RL-based methods. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of RL applications for power grid topology optimization, categorizing existing techniques, highlighting key design choices, and identifying gaps in current research. Additionally, we present a comparative numerical study evaluating the impact of commonly applied RL-based methods, offering insights into their practical effectiveness. By consolidating existing research and outlining open challenges, this survey aims to provide a foundation for future advancements in RL-driven power grid optimization.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-assisted Interval Reachability for Systems with Control Barrier Function-Based Safe Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been widely utilized in the design of optimization-based controllers and filters for dynamical systems to ensure forward invariance of a given set of safe states. While CBF-based controllers offer safety guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system, leading to undesirable behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and emergence of locally stable spurious equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems with CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and stability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory re-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval reachability method for performance verification of systems with optimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based controller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization problems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an embedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification algorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of closeness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the optimization-based controller and the neural network are derived. Using a single trajectory of the embedding system along with our closeness of solutions result, we obtain an over-approximation of the reachable set of the system with optimization-based controllers. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the technical findings.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Estimator Synthesis with Instantaneous Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven controller design based on data informativity has gained popularity due to its straightforward applicability, while providing rigorous guarantees. However, applying this framework to the estimator synthesis problem introduces technical challenges, which can only be solved so far by adding restrictive assumptions. In this work, we remove these restrictions to improve performance guarantees. Moreover, our parameterization allows the integration of additional structural knowledge, such as bounds on parameters. Our findings are validated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed data-driven control without persistence of excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that data that is not sufficiently informative to allow for system re-identification can still provide meaningful information when combined with external or physical knowledge of the system, such as bounded system matrix norms. We then illustrate how this information can be leveraged for safety and energy minimization problems and to enhance predictions in unmodelled dynamics. This preliminary work outlines key ideas toward using limited data for effective control by integrating physical knowledge of the system and exploiting interpolation conditions.</description>

      <title>POD-Based Sparse Stochastic Estimation of Wind Turbine Blade Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a framework for estimating the full vibrational state of wind turbine blades from sparse deflection measurements. The identification is performed in a reduced-order space obtained from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations based on Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT). In this space, a Reduced Order Model (ROM) is constructed using a linear stochastic estimator, and further enhanced through Kalman fusion with a quasi-steady model of azimuthal dynamics driven by measured wind speed. The performance of the proposed estimator is assessed in a synthetic environment replicating turbulent inflow and measurement noise over a wide range of operating conditions. Results demonstrate the method's ability to accurately reconstruct three-dimensional deformations and accelerations using noisy displacement and acceleration measurements at only four spatial locations. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework for real-time blade monitoring, optimal sensor placement, and active load control in wind turbine systems.</description>

      <title>Secondary Safety Control for Systems with Sector Bounded Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safety verification and safety-aware controller synthesis for systems with sector bounded nonlinearities. We aim to keep the states of the system within a given safe set under potential actuator and sensor attacks. Specifically, we adopt the setup that a controller has already been designed to stabilize the plant. Using invariant sets and barrier certificate theory, we first give sufficient conditions to verify the safety of the closed-loop system under attacks. Furthermore, by using a subset of sensors that are assumed to be free of attacks, we provide a synthesis method for a secondary controller that enhances the safety of the system. The sufficient conditions to verify safety are derived using Lyapunov-based tools and the S-procedure. Using the projection lemma, the conditions are then formulated as linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems which can be solved efficiently. Lastly, our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Control Co-Design Under Uncertainty for Offshore Wind Farms: Optimizing Grid Integration, Energy Storage, and Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller for Systems with Bounded Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller (UTC), a technique to control nonlinear systems motivated as a dual to the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). We consider linear, discrete-time systems augmented by a bounded nonlinear function of the state. For such systems, we review 1-step and N-step versions of the UTC. Using a Lyapunov-based analysis, we prove that the states and inputs converge to a bounded ball around the origin, whose radius depends on the bound on the nonlinearity. Using examples of a fighter jet model and a quadcopter, we demonstrate that the UTC achieves satisfactory regulation and tracking performance on these nonlinear models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0, the refining industry is evolving towards large-scale integration and flexible production systems. In response to these new demands, this paper presents a novel optimization framework for plant-wide refinery planning, integrating model decomposition with deep reinforcement learning. The approach decomposes the complex large scale refinery optimization problem into manageable submodels, improving computational efficiency while preserving accuracy. A reinforcement learning-based pricing mechanism is introduced to generate pricing strategies for intermediate products, facilitating better coordination between submodels and enabling rapid responses to market changes. Three industrial case studies, covering both single-period and multi-period planning, demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency while ensuring refinery profitability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the gradient-based extremum seeking control for multivariable maps under actuator saturation. By exploiting a polytopic embedding of the unknown Hessian, we derive a LMI-based synthesis condition to ensure that the origin of the average closed-loop error system is exponentially stable. Then, the convergence of the extremum seeking control system under actuator saturation to the unknown optimal point is proved by employing Lyapunov stability and averaging theories. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Day-to-day Dynamic Tolling in Tradable Credit Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tradable credit schemes (TCS) are an increasingly studied alternative to congestion pricing, given their revenue neutrality and ability to address issues of equity through the initial credit allocation. Modeling TCS to aid future design and implementation is associated with challenges involving user and market behaviors, demand-supply dynamics, and control mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the latter and address the day-to-day dynamic tolling problem under TCS, which is formulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process and solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Our results indicate that RL algorithms achieve travel times and social welfare comparable to the Bayesian optimization benchmark, with generalization across varying capacities and demand levels. We further assess the robustness of RL under different hyperparameters and apply regularization techniques to mitigate action oscillation, which generates practical tolling strategies that are transferable under day-to-day demand and supply variability. Finally, we discuss potential challenges such as scaling to large networks, and show how transfer learning can be leveraged to improve computational efficiency and facilitate the practical deployment of RL-based TCS solutions.</description>

      <title>RL-based Control of UAS Subject to Significant Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based control framework for position and attitude control of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) subjected to significant disturbance that can be associated with an uncertain trigger signal. The proposed method learns the relationship between the trigger signal and disturbance force, enabling the system to anticipate and counteract the impending disturbances before they occur. We train and evaluate three policies: a baseline policy trained without exposure to the disturbance, a reactive policy trained with the disturbance but without the trigger signal, and a predictive policy that incorporates the trigger signal as an observation and is exposed to the disturbance during training. Our simulation results show that the predictive policy outperforms the other policies by minimizing position deviations through a proactive correction maneuver. This work highlights the potential of integrating predictive cues into RL frameworks to improve UAS performance.</description>

      <title>Spectral Normalization for Lipschitz-Constrained Policies on Learning Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in training agile and adaptable controllers for legged robots, enabling them to learn complex locomotion behaviors directly from experience. However, policies trained in simulation often fail to transfer to real-world robots due to unrealistic assumptions such as infinite actuator bandwidth and the absence of torque limits. These conditions allow policies to rely on abrupt, high-frequency torque changes, which are infeasible for real actuators with finite bandwidth.
  Traditional methods address this issue by penalizing aggressive motions through regularization rewards, such as joint velocities, accelerations, and energy consumption, but they require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Alternatively, Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP) enforce finite bandwidth action control by penalizing policy gradients, but their reliance on gradient calculations introduces significant GPU memory overhead. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes Spectral Normalization (SN) as an efficient replacement for enforcing Lipschitz continuity. By constraining the spectral norm of network weights, SN effectively limits high-frequency policy fluctuations while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Experimental evaluations in both simulation and real-world humanoid robot show that SN achieves performance comparable to gradient penalty methods while enabling more efficient parallel training.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite horizon optimal control problems with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on four robotic motion planning problems. IPDDP2 reliably converges to low optimality error and exhibits local quadratic and global convergence from remote starting points. Notably, we showcase the robustness of IPDDP2 by using it to solve a contact-implicit, joint limited acrobot swing-up problem involving complementarity constraints from a range of initial conditions. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</description>

      <title>Statistical Linear Regression Approach to Kalman Filtering and Smoothing under Cyber-Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems is often vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to wireless connections between sensors and computing units. In such scenarios, adversaries compromise the system by injecting false data or blocking measurement transmissions via denial-of-service attacks, distorting sensor readings. This paper develops a Kalman filter and Rauch--Tung--Striebel (RTS) smoother for linear stochastic state-space models subject to cyber-attacked measurements. We approximate the faulty measurement model via generalized statistical linear regression (GSLR). The GSLR-based approximated measurement model is then used to develop a Kalman filter and RTS smoother for the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under cyber-attacks is demonstrated through a simulated aircraft tracking experiment.</description>

      <title>Sectoral and spatial decomposition methods for multi-sector capacity expansion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-sector capacity expansion models play a crucial role in energy planning by providing decision support for policymaking in technology development. To ensure reliable support, these models require high technological, spatial, and temporal resolution, leading to large-scale linear programming problems that are often computationally intractable. To address this challenge, conventional approaches rely on simplifying abstractions that trade accuracy for computational efficiency. Benders decomposition has been widely explored to improve computational efficiency in electricity capacity expansion models. Specifically, state-of-the-art methods have primarily focused on improving performance through temporal decomposition. However, multi-sector models introduce additional complexity, requiring new decomposition strategies. In this work, we propose a budget-based formulation to extend decomposition to the sectoral and spatial domains. We test the developed sectoral and spatial Benders decomposition algorithms on case studies of the continental United States, considering different configurations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Results show that our algorithms achieve substantial performance improvement compared to existing decomposition algorithms, with runtime reductions within 15%-70%. The proposed methods leverage the generic structure of multi-sector capacity expansion models, and can thus be applied to most existing energy planning models, ensuring computational tractability without sacrificing resolution.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring safe autonomy is crucial for deploying aerial robots in real-world applications. However, safety is a multifaceted challenge that must be addressed from multiple perspectives, including navigation in dynamic environments, operation under resource constraints, and robustness against adversarial attacks and uncertainties. In this paper, we present the authors' recent work that tackles some of these challenges and highlights key aspects that must be considered to enhance the safety and performance of autonomous aerial systems.

      <title>Neural Fidelity Calibration for Informative Sim-to-Real Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and navigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands expert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge simulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the reconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity Calibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based diffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual fidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual fidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world dynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us to sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy fine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a) we fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build sequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the diffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may degrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable hallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator calibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse robots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical contribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and real-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot navigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle on snowy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for a Quadruped Robot Leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexities in the dynamic model of the legged robots make it necessary to utilize model-free controllers in the task of trajectory tracking. In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Steady-state Learning for Robust Output Regulation of Nonlinear Output Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the presented nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization endeavour for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics, removing the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semidefinite derivatives and the commmonly employed assumption that the nonlinear system should be linear-in-parameter(parameterized) condition. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be classified into a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state/input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous by guaranteeing convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with interconnected networks with non-identical subsystems. We investigate the output consensus of the network where the dynamics are subject to external disturbance and/or reference input. For a network of output-feedback passive subsystems, we first introduce an index that characterises the gap between a pair of adjacent subsystems by the difference of their input-output trajectories. The set of these indices quantifies the level of heterogeneity of the networks. We then provide a condition in terms of the level of heterogeneity and the connectivity of the networks for ensuring the output consensus of the interconnected network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we design formal verification and control algorithms for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees using conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate).
  We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the notion of r-robustness for the communication graph of the network has been introduced to address the challenge of achieving consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Higher r-robustness typically implies higher tolerance to malicious information towards achieving resilient consensus, but it also implies more edges for the communication graph. This in turn conflicts with the need to minimize communication due to limited resources in real-world applications (e.g., multi-robot networks). In this paper, our contributions are twofold. (a) We provide the necessary subgraph structures and tight lower bounds on the number of edges required for graphs with a given number of nodes to achieve maximum robustness. (b) We then use the results of (a) to introduce two classes of graphs that maintain maximum robustness with the least number of edges. Our work is validated through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>A System Parametrization for Direct Data-Driven Analysis and Control with Error-in-Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new parametrization to perform direct data-driven analysis and controller synthesis for the error-in-variables case. To achieve this, we employ the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to transform the problem into a linear fractional transformation (LFT) with unknown measurement errors and disturbances as uncertainties. For bounded uncertainties, we apply robust control techniques to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the H2-norm of the unknown true system. To this end, a single semidefinite program (SDP) needs to be solved, with complexity that is independent of the amount of data. Furthermore, we exploit the signal-to-noise ratio to provide a data-dependent condition, that characterizes whether the proposed parametrization can be employed. The modular formulation allows to extend this framework to controller synthesis with different performance criteria, input-output settings, and various system properties. Finally, we validate the proposed approach through a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limit its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by modifying the SRG of a linear time invariant operator, combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion, and apply our result to Lur'e systems. We thereby obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with a broader class of nonlinearities, and provides (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds.</description>

Abstract: An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</description>

Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</description>

      <title>Insights into the explainability of Lasso-based DeePC for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has recently gained the spotlight as an easy-to-use control technique that allows for constraint handling while relying on raw data only. Initially proposed for linear time-invariant systems, several DeePC extensions are now available to cope with nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, these solutions mainly focus on ensuring the controller's effectiveness, overlooking the explainability of the final result. As a step toward explaining the outcome of DeePC for the control of nonlinear systems, in this paper, we focus on analyzing the earliest and simplest DeePC approach proposed to cope with nonlinearities in the controlled system, using a Lasso regularization. Our theoretical analysis highlights that the decisions undertaken by DeePC with Lasso regularization are unexplainable, as control actions are determined by data incoherent with the system's local behavior. This result is true even when the available input/output samples are grouped according to the different operating conditions explored during data collection. Our numerical study confirms these findings, highlighting the benefits of data grouping in terms of performance while showing that explainability remains a challenge in control design via DeePC.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids with ZIP Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control and communication topology co-design approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (DC MGs) with generic ``ZIP'' loads. While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes) to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Online Identification-based Policy Iteration to Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the core mechanisms of indirect data-driven control for unknown systems, focusing on the application of policy iteration (PI) within the context of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control problem. Specifically, we consider a setting where data is collected sequentially from a linear system subject to exogenous process noise, and is then used to refine estimates of the optimal control policy. We integrate recursive least squares (RLS) for online model estimation within a certainty-equivalent framework, and employ PI to iteratively update the control policy. In this work, we investigate first the convergence behavior of RLS under two different models of adversarial noise, namely point-wise and energy bounded noise, and then we provide a closed-loop analysis of the combined model identification and control design process. This iterative scheme is formulated as an algorithmic dynamical system consisting of the feedback interconnection between two algorithms expressed as discrete-time systems. This system theoretic viewpoint on indirect data-driven control allows us to establish convergence guarantees to the optimal controller in the face of uncertainty caused by noisy data. Simulations illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper develops a novel motion model, called Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model (GMDM), which extends the Dubins model by considering multiple speeds. While the Dubins model produces time-optimal paths under a constant speed constraint, these paths could be suboptimal if this constraint is relaxed to include multiple speeds. This is because a constant speed results in a large minimum turning radius, thus producing paths with longer maneuvers and larger travel times. In contrast, multi-speed relaxation allows for slower speed sharp turns, thus producing more direct paths with shorter maneuvers and smaller travel times. Furthermore, the inability of the Dubins model to reduce speed could result in fast maneuvers near obstacles, thus producing paths with high collision risks.
  In this regard, GMDM provides the motion planners the ability to jointly optimize time and risk by allowing the change of speed along the path. GMDM is built upon the six Dubins path types considering the change of speed on path segments. It is theoretically established that GMDM provides full reachability of the configuration space for any speed selections. Furthermore, it is shown that the Dubins model is a specific case of GMDM for constant speeds. The solutions of GMDM are analytical and suitable for real-time applications. The performance of GMDM in terms of solution quality (i.e., time/time-risk cost) and computation time is comparatively evaluated against the existing motion models in obstacle-free as well as obstacle-rich environments via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that in obstacle-free environments, GMDM produces near time-optimal paths with significantly lower travel times than the Dubins model while having similar computation times. In obstacle-rich environments, GMDM produces time-risk optimized paths with substantially lower collision risks.</description>

      <title>The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy of Risks From Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &amp; toxicity, (2) Privacy &amp; security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &amp; misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic &amp; environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, &amp; limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Strong r-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong r-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Planning and Learning in Risk-Aware Restless Multi-Arm Bandit Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In restless multi-arm bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless multi-arm bandit problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless multi-arm bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>
