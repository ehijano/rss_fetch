      <title>Hierarchical AI Multi-Agent Fundamental Investing: Evidence from China's A-Share Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent, AI-driven framework for fundamental investing that integrates macro indicators, industry-level and firm-specific information to construct optimized equity portfolios. The architecture comprises: (i) a Macro agent that dynamically screens and weights sectors based on evolving economic indicators and industry performance; (ii) four firm-level agents -- Fundamental, Technical, Report, and News -- that conduct in-depth analyses of individual firms to ensure both breadth and depth of coverage; (iii) a Portfolio agent that uses reinforcement learning to combine the agent outputs into a unified policy to generate the trading strategy; and (iv) a Risk Control agent that adjusts portfolio positions in response to market volatility. We evaluate the system on the constituents by the CSI 300 Index of China's A-share market and find that it consistently outperforms standard benchmarks and a state-of-the-art multi-agent trading system on risk-adjusted returns and drawdown control. Our core contribution is a hierarchical multi-agent design that links top-down macro screening with bottom-up fundamental analysis, offering a robust and extensible approach to factor-based portfolio construction.</description>

      <title>Goal-based portfolio selection with fixed transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a goal-based portfolio selection problem in which an investor aims to meet multiple financial goals, each with a specific deadline and target amount. Trading the stock incurs a strictly positive transaction cost. Using the stochastic Perron's method, we show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to a system of quasi-variational inequalities. The existence of an optimal trading strategy and goal funding scheme is established. Numerical results reveal complex optimal trading regions and show that the optimal investment strategy differs substantially from the V-shaped strategy observed in the frictionless case.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Trend: How to Avoid Cherry-Picked Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our empirical results, illustrated in Fig.5, show an impressive fit with the pretty complex theoretical Sharpe formula of a Trend following strategy depending on the parameter of the signal, which was derived by Grebenkov and Serror (2014). That empirical fit convinces us that a mean-reversion process with only one time scale is enough to model, in a pretty precise way, the reality of the trend-following mechanism at the average scale of CTAs and as a consequence, using only one simple EMA, appears optimal to capture the trend. As a consequence, using a complex basket of different complex indicators as signal, do not seem to be so rational or optimal and exposes to the risk of cherry-picking.</description>
