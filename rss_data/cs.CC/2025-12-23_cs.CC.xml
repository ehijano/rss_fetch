      <title>On the complexity of computing Strahler numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the problem of computing the Strahler number of a binary tree given as a term is complete for the circuit complexity class uniform $\mathsf{NC}^1$. For several variants, where the binary tree is given by a pointer structure or in a succinct form by a directed acyclic graph or a tree straight-line program, the complexity of computing the Strahler number is determined as well. The problem, whether a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form produces a derivation tree (resp., an acyclic derivation tree), whose Strahler number is at least a given number $k$ is shown to be P-complete (resp., PSPACE-complete).</description>

      <title>Negations are powerful even in small depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the power of negation in the Boolean and algebraic settings and show the following results.
  * We construct a family of polynomials $P_n$ in $n$ variables, all of whose monomials have positive coefficients, such that $P_n$ can be computed by a depth three circuit of polynomial size but any monotone circuit computing it has size $2^{\Omega(n)}$. This is the strongest possible separation result between monotone and non-monotone arithmetic computations and improves upon all earlier results, including the seminal work of Valiant (1980) and more recently by Chattopadhyay, Datta, and Mukhopadhyay (2021). We then boot-strap this result to prove strong monotone separations for polynomials of constant degree, which solves an open problem from the survey of Shpilka and Yehudayoff (2010).
  * By moving to the Boolean setting, we can prove superpolynomial monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for specific Boolean functions, which imply that all the powers of certain monotone polynomials cannot be computed by polynomially sized monotone arithmetic circuits.
  * We then define a collection of problems with linear-algebraic nature, which are similar to span programs, and prove monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for them. In particular, this gives the strongest known monotone lower bounds for functions in uniform (non-monotone) $\textbf{NC}^2$. Our construction also leads to an explicit matroid that defines a monotone function that is difficult to compute, which solves an open problem by Jukna and Seiwert (2020).
  Our monotone arithmetic and Boolean circuit lower bounds are based on known techniques, such as reduction from monotone arithmetic complexity to multipartition communication complexity and the approximation method for proving lower bounds for monotone Boolean circuits, but we overcome several new challenges in order to obtain efficient upper bounds using low-depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Assembly Addition Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the notion of Addition Chains over Z+ to a general set S. We explain how the algebraic structure of Assembly Multi-Magma over the pairs (S,BB proper subset of S) allows to define the concept of Addition Chain over S, called Assembly Addition Chains of S with Building Blocks BB. Analogously to the Z+ case, we introduce the concept of Optimal Assembly Addition Chains over S and prove lower and upper bounds for their lengths, similar to the bounds found by Schonhage for the Z+ case. In the general case the unit 1 is in set Z+ is replaced by the subset BB and the mentioned bounds for the length of an Optimal Assembly Addition Chain of O is in set S are defined in terms of the size of O (i.e. the number of Building Blocks required to construct O). The main examples of S that we consider through this papers are (i) j-Strings (Strings with an alphabeth of j letters), (ii) Colored Connected Graphs and (iii) Colored Polyominoes.</description>

      <title>Classical billiards can compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c &gt; 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Isolation In Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A language is said to be in catalytic logspace if we can test membership using a deterministic logspace machine that has an additional read/write tape filled with arbitrary data whose contents have to be restored to their original value at the end of the computation. The model of catalytic computation was introduced by Buhrman et al [STOC2014].
  As our first result, we obtain a catalytic logspace algorithm for computing a minimum weight witness to a search problem, with small weights, provided the algorithm is given oracle access for the corresponding weighted decision problem. In particular, our reduction yields CL algorithms for the search versions of the following three problems: planar perfect matching, planar exact perfect matching and weighted arborescences in weighted digraphs.
  Our second set of results concern the significantly larger class CL^{NP}_{2-round}. We show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} contains SearchSAT and the complexity classes BPP, MA and ZPP^{NP[1]}. While SearchSAT is shown to be in CL^{NP}_{2-round} using the isolation lemma, the other three containments, while based on the compress-or-random technique, use the Nisan-Wigderson [JCSS 1994] based pseudo-random generator. These containments show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} resembles ZPP^NP more than P^{NP}, providing some weak evidence that CL is more like ZPP than P.
  For our third set of results we turn to isolation well inside catalytic classes. We consider the unambiguous catalytic class CTISP[poly(n),logn,log^2n]^UL and show that it contains reachability and therefore NL. This is a catalytic version of the result of van Melkebeek &amp; Prakriya [SIAM J. Comput. 2019]. Building on their result, we also show a tradeoff between the workspace of the oracle and the catalytic space of the base machine. Finally, we extend these catalytic upper bounds to LogCFL.</description>

      <title>Toward P vs NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery in $L_2$ and other norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07539v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recovery of functions in various norms, including $L_p$ with $1\le p\le\infty$, based on function evaluations. We obtain worst case error bounds for general classes of functions in terms of the best $L_2$-approximation from a given nested sequence of subspaces and the Christoffel function of these subspaces. In the case $p=\infty$, our results imply that linear sampling algorithms are optimal up to a constant factor for many reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>
