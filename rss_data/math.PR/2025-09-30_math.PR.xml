      <title>Smooth measures and positive continuous additive functionals attached to a compact nest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between smooth measures and positive continuous additive functionals is well known, and this correspondence is called the Revuz correspondence. We investigate the relationships between several types of convergence of smooth measures and convergence of positive continuous additive functionals, mainly focusing on a treatment of nests. We provide conditions under which convergence of additive functionals implies convergence of the corresponding smooth measures. Our results cover convergence of smooth measures that are not Radon, including nowhere Radon measures.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Markovian Couplings of Levy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal Markovian coupling problem for two Pi-valued Feller processes {X_t} and {Y_t}, which seeks a coupling process {(X_t, Y_t)} that minimizes the right derivative at t = 0 of the expected cost E^{(x,y)}[c(X_t, Y_t)], for all initial states (x,y) in Pi^2 and a given cost function c on Pi. This problem was first formulated and solved by Chen (1994) for drift-diffusion processes and later extended by Zhang (2000) to Markov processes with bounded jumps. In this work, we resolve the case of Levy processes under the quadratic cost c(x,y) = 1/2 |x - y|^2 by introducing a new formulation of the "Levy optimal transport problem" between Levy measures. We show that the resulting optimal coupling process {(X_t*, Y_t*)}_{t &gt;= 0} satisfies a minimal growth property: for each t &gt;= 0 and x,y in R^d, the expectation E^{(x,y)}|X_t* - Y_t*|^2 is minimized among all Feller couplings. A key feature of our approach is the development of a dual problem, expressed as a variational principle over test functions of the generators. We prove strong duality for this formulation, thereby closing the optimality gap. As a byproduct, we obtain a Wasserstein-type metric on the space of Levy generators and Levy measures with finite second moment, and establish several of its fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Controlled rough paths: a general Hopf-algebraic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up controlled rough paths for a class of combinatorial Hopf algebras, encompassing shuffle, Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and Munthe-Kaas--Wright Hopf algebras. The class of controls we consider encompasses both H\"older continuous paths and (not necessarily continuous) paths with bounded $p$-variation. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of a lifted initial value problem in this general setting by applying the fixed point method in a suitable Banach space of controlled rough paths, and we prove a universal limit theorem addressing the robustness of the solution with respect to the parameters and the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Davis inequality for biparameter filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Davis inequality $\mathbb{E} Sf\simeq \mathbb{E} f^*$ between $L^1$ norms of square function of a martingale and its maximal function is known for martingales indexed by linearly ordered filtrations and in some particular cases for double indexed one. We prove the $\gtrsim $ inequality for arbitrary filtrations satisfying the (F4) condition of Cairoli and Walsh and propose a method to attack the other inequality. The former is done by means of a two-parameter analogue of Davis-Garsia decomposition.</description>

      <title>Crossing probabilities in geometric inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a geometric inhomogeneous random graph vertices are given by the points of a Poisson process and are equipped with independent weights following a heavy tailed distribution. Any pair of distinct vertices is independently forming an edge with a probability decaying as a function of the product of the weights divided by the distance of the vertices. For this continuum percolation model we study the crossing probabilities of annuli, i.e. the probabilities that there exist paths starting inside a ball and ending outside a larger concentric ball with increasing inner and outer radii. Depending on the radii, the power-law exponent of the degree distribution and the decay of the probability of long edges, we identify regimes where the crossing probabilities by a path are equivalent to the crossing probabilities by one or by two edges. We also identify the escape probabilities from balls with strong centre, i.e. the asymptotics of the probability that there exists a path starting from a vertex with a given weight leaving a centred ball as radius and weight are going to infinity. As a corollary we get the subcritical one-arm exponents characterising the decay of the probability that a typical point is in a component not contained in a centred ball whose radius goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents and growth indices for fractional stochastic heat equations with space-time L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fractional stochastic heat equations with space-time L\'evy white noise of the form $$\frac{\partial X}{\partial t}(t,x)={\cal L}_{\alpha}X(t,x)+\sigma(X(t,x))\dot{\Lambda}(t,x).$$ Here, the principal part ${\cal L}_{\alpha}=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ is the $d$-dimensional fractional Laplacian with $\alpha\in (0,2)$, the noise term $\dot{\Lambda}(t,x)$ denotes the space-time L\'evy white noise, and the function $\sigma: \R\mapsto \R$ is Lipschitz continuous. Under suitable assumptions, we obtain bounds for the Lyapunov exponents and the growth indices of exponential type on $p$th moments of the mild solutions, which are connected with the weakly intermittency properties and the characterizations of the high peaks propagate away from the origin. Unlike the case of the Gaussian noise, the proofs heavily depend on the heavy tail property of heat kernel estimates for the fractional Laplacian. The results complement these in \cite{CD15-1,CK19} for fractional stochastic heat equations driven by space-time white noise and stochastic heat equations with L\'evy noise, respectively.</description>

      <title>A critical stochastic heat equation with long-range noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a semilinear stochastic heat equation in spatial dimension at least $3$, forced by a noise that is white in time with a covariance kernel that decays like $\lvert x\rvert^{-2}$ as $\lvert x\rvert\to\infty$. We show that in an appropriate diffusive scaling limit with a logarithmic attenuation of the noise, the pointwise statistics of the solution can be approximated by the solution to a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). The scaling and structure of the problem is similar to that of the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation forced by an approximation of space-time white noise considered by the first author and Gu (Ann. Probab., 2022). However the resulting FBSDE is different due to the long-range correlations of the noise.</description>

      <title>Sum rules via large deviations: polynomial potentials and multi-cut regime on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum rules are elegant formulas that relate entropy functionals to coefficients associated with orthogonal polynomials [Sim11]. In a series of paper (see for example [GNR16], [GNR17], [BSZ18a], [BSZ18b]), interesting connections have been established between the large theory of spectral measures built on random matrices and sum rules. In this work, we extend this approach by studying sum rules within random matrix models with polynomial potentials on the unit circle, with a particular focus on cases where the equilibrium measure lacks full support.</description>

      <title>Zero-Waiting Load Balancing with Heterogeneous Servers in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the steady-state delay performance of load balancing in large-scale systems with heterogeneous servers in the heavy-traffic regimes. The system consists of $N$ servers, each with a local buffer of size $b-1$, serving jobs in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda N$, where $\lambda = 1 - N^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed with fully heterogeneous rates, where the service rate of each server can differ and may scale with the system size $N$. We study a queue length aware and service rate aware load balancing policy, Join-the-Fastest-Shortest-Queue (JFSQ), and demonstrate that it achieves asymptotic zero waiting time and probability under the heavy traffic regimes, including both the Sub-Halfin-Whitt ($\alpha \in (0,0.5)$) and Super-Halfin-Whitt ($\alpha \in [0.5,1)$) regimes. The performance bounds of waiting time and probability explicitly capture the convergence rate w.r.t. the system size $N$ and show the negative effect of server heterogeneity. Our analysis builds on the general framework of Stein's method with iterative state-space peeling, where we design a sequence of Lyapunov functions to analyze the high-dimensional heterogeneous system without assuming exchangeability and monotonicity. Our analysis shows that JFSQ efficiently utilizes servers with higher capacities, and the steady-state system can be coupled with a single-server queue via Stein's method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish delay performance bounds of a load-balancing system with size $N$ and fully heterogeneous servers in heavy traffic.</description>

      <title>On random bipartite graphs evolving by degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a bipartite analogue of the `random graphs evolving by degrees' process. We are given a bipartitioned set of vertices $V$ into two disjoint parts ${L}$ and ${R}$ and possibly unequal positive constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The graph evolves starting from $B_0$, the empty graph (with only isolated vertices). Given $B_t$, a non-adjacent vertex pair $u \in {L}, v \in {R}$ is sampled with probability proportional to $(d_u(t)+\alpha)(d_v(t)+\beta)$, and the edge $\{u,v\}$ is included to $B_t$ to form $B_{t+1}$, where $d_u(t)$ is the degree of $u$ in $B_t$. For this model, we establish the threshold for the appearance of a giant component, the connectivity threshold for the associated multigraph variant, and provide a superlinear lower bound on the connectivity threshold for the simple graph case.
  For the proof of the giant component result, our methods involve setting up an exact coupling of the multigraph case with a bipartite configuration model and using existing results on the giant of bipartite configuration models. This is an adaptation of the technique of Janson and Warnke (Ann. Appl. Probab. 2021) where they treat the unipartite case similarly. For the connectivity results, we first set up a formula for the exact probability of the occurrence of certain connectivity events in the multigraph process, which is interesting in its own right. To then derive the connectedness threshold, we analyze a particular case of it \`a la Pittel (Adv. Math. 2010). For the superlinear connectivity lower bound in the simple graph case, we establish and use a tail bound on the number of isolated vertices in the multigraph process, together with a change of measure statement to go from the multi to the simple graph process.</description>

      <title>Geometric Brownian motion with random observation time as generalization of the double Pareto distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the value of geometric Brownian motion at the stochastic observation time. It is known that the exponentially distributed observation time yields the distribution called the double Pareto distribution, and this study aims to generalize this distribution. First, we provide a calculation formula for the moment of the observed value of geometric Brownian motion using the moment-generating function of the observation time distribution. Next, the probability density of the observed value of geometric Brownian motion is exactly derived under the observation time following the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. This result includes cases where the observation time follows the gamma, inverse gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions, and can be regarded as a generalization of the double Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced criticality in $p$-adic scaling limits of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An anisotropy parameter $h$ in $(0,1]$ induces on $\mathbb{Q}_p^2$ a duality-compatible, two-scale filtration that collapses to one scale at the right endpoint. This filtration defines shell-uniform transition laws for hierarchical random walks on a discrete group whose scaling limits are L\'{e}vy processes on $\mathbb{Q}_p^2$. The diffusion constants of the coordinate processes jump at the right endpoint, even though the radial jump law depends continuously on $h$. This instance of geometry-induced criticality isolates a structural mechanism that should extend to locally compact abelian groups and suggests a route to studying critical behavior in ultrametric models.</description>

      <title>A family of non-uniform distributions on the set of parking functions generated by random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a rather natural family of non-uniform distributions on $PF_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the set of parking functions of length $n$. One of the motivations for this comes from a similar situation in the context of integer partitions. For a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ and for $j\in[n]$, let $I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)$ denote the number of inversions in $\sigma$ that involve the number $j$ and a number less than $j$. Let $\tilde I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)=I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)+1$. The map $(\sigma,\tau)\to\left(\tilde I_{n,&lt;\tau_1}(\sigma),\cdots, \tilde I_{n,&lt; \tau_n}(\sigma)\right)$ maps $S_n\times S_n$ onto $PF_n$. Consider the family of distributions $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$, $q\in(0,\infty)$, on $S_n\times S_n$, where $P_n$ is the uniform distribution on $S_n$ and $P_n^{(q)}$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $q$ on $S_n$. The Mallows distributions are defined by exponential tilting via the inversion statistic. For each $q&gt;0$, the above map along with the distribution $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$ induces an exchangeable distribution $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$ on $PF_n$. We study the asymptotic behavior of two fundamental statistics of parking functions under the family of distributions $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the squared G-Bessel process as the square of the modulus of a class of G-Brownian motions and establish that it is the unique solution to a stochastic differential equation. We then derive several path properties of the squared G-Bessel process, which are more profound in the capacity sense. Furthermore, we provide upper and lower bounds for the Laplace transform of the squared G-Bessel process. Finally, we prove that the time-space transformed squared G-Bessel process is a G'-CIR process.</description>

      <title>Birth of a gap: Critical phenomena in 2D Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>

      <title>Large and Moderate Deviations for Entries of Orthogonal Matrices and the Stiefel Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_N$ be distributed according to the Haar probability measure on the orthogonal group $\mathscr{O}(N)$ for each $N\in\mathbb{N}$. It is well-known that the upper left $m_N\times k_N$ block of $\sqrt{N}A_N$ with $m_Nk_N = o(N)$ converges in total variation distance to a matrix of same size consisting of i.i.d. standard normal entries as $N\to\infty$. In this work, we characterize this convergence on the scale of large deviations. More precisely, we show that under the same condition $m_Nk_N = o(N)$ the empirical measure of entries of this block satisfies a large deviation principle with speed $m_Nk_N$ and rate function given by the relative entropy with respect to the standard normal distribution. Further, we complement the large deviation principle (LDP) obtained by Kabluchko and Prochno in [Large deviations for random matrices in the orthogonal group and Stiefel manifold with applications to random projections of product distributions, Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincar\'e. 60 (2024), 990 -- 1024] for the whole block $A_N$ with a moderate deviation principle (MDP). Concretely, we show an MDP for the sequence of matrices $\beta_N A_N$ in the product topology, where $\beta_N\to\infty$ is a sequence of real numbers such that $\beta_N = o(\sqrt{N})$. Here, in contrast to the LDP, the Gaussian behavior of the entries is reflected in the rate function.</description>

      <title>Limiting behaviour of pattern counts in biased binary strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p \in (0,1)$, sample a binary sequence from the infinite product measure of Bernoulli$(p)$ distributions. It is known that for $p=1/2$, almost every binary sequence is Poisson generic in the sense of Peres and Weiss, a property that reflects a specific statistical pattern in the frequency of finite substrings. However, this behaviour is highly exceptional: it fails for any $p \ne 1/2$. In these other cases, we show that the frequency of substrings of almost every sequence has either trivial or peculiar behaviour. Nevertheless, the Poisson limiting regime can be recovered if one restricts attention to substrings with a fixed number of successes in the Bernoulli$(p)$ trials.</description>

      <title>Collision types and times in interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.</description>

      <title>Arm events in critical planar loop soups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish up-to-constants estimates for arm events in the Brownian loop soup on the 2D metric graph associated with the square lattice. More specifically, we consider two natural geometric events: first, ``bulk'' four-arm events, corresponding to two large connected components of loops getting close to each other; and then, two-arm events in the half-plane, used to estimate the probability that a cluster of loops approaches the boundary. Our proof relies on an estimate by Lupu-Werner [Probab. Theory Related Fields 171(3):775-818, 2018], thanks to the well-known coupling between the loop soup and the Gaussian free field on the metric graph [Lecture Notes in Mathematics, volume 2026, 2011] and [Ann. Probab. 44(3):2117-2146, 2016].
  As a consequence, we also obtain up-to-constant upper bounds for the corresponding arm events in the random walk loop soup on the square lattice. In this way, we verify Assumptions 5.7 and 5.11 in arXiv:2409.16273: in a box with side length $N$, this implies the existence of crossings where the Gaussian free field remains below $a\sqrt{\log \log N}$ in absolute value, for some constant $a &gt; 0$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tennis In-Match Momentum Using Probability Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Tennis Momentum Model (TMM), which aims to enhance the understanding of match dynamics by integrating key factors such as efficiency, historical scoring probabilities, and real-time scoring data. The model is designed to explore how momentum affects player performance throughout a match and how it might influence overall match outcomes. By leveraging this model, players and coaches could gain valuable insights that may help them adjust their strategies in response to shifting momentum during a match.
  To validate the model, it was tested on two tennis matches, revealing its effectiveness in capturing shifts in momentum and correlating these shifts with scoring events. The results showed that the TMM accurately depicted the flow of momentum during matches, highlighting how shifts in momentum are directly linked to changes in scoring as the match progresses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize maps $\phi_i: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}$, $i=1, \ldots, m$ and $m\ge 1$, that have the multiplicative spectrum or trace preserving property:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  \textrm{spec} (\phi_1(A_1)\cdots \phi_m(A_m)) &amp;=&amp; \textrm{spec} (A_1\cdots A_m),\quad\text{or}\quad
  \textrm{tr} (\phi_1(A_1)\cdots \phi_m(A_m)) &amp;=&amp; \textrm{tr} (A_1\cdots A_m),
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of $n\times n$ doubly stochastic, row stochastic, or column stochastic matrices, or the space spanned by one of these sets.
  Linearity is assumed when $m=1$. We show that every stochastic matrix contains a real doubly stochastic component that carries the spectral information.
  In consequence, the multiplicative spectrum or trace preservers on these sets $ \mathcal{S} $ are linked to the
  corresponding preservers on the space of doubly stochastic matrices.
  Moreover, when $m\ge 3$, multiplicative trace preservers always coincide with multiplicative spectrum preservers.</description>

      <title>Concept activation vectors: a unifying view and adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the (non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic study.</description>

      <title>Exponentially slow Mixing arising from Entropic Repulsion in $p$-SOS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Glauber dynamics of the generalized (2+1)-dimensional $p$-SOS model under a hard floor constraint. This setting induces entropic repulsion: the integer-valued interface height is forced to remain above the wall and consequently rises to a typical height $H(p,L)$ that depends on both the parameter $p$ and the system size $L$. In the classical SOS model ($p=1$), \cite{caputo2016scaling, caputo2014dynamics} derived an exponential lower bound for the mixing time, demonstrating that the Glauber dynamics mixes only after an exponentially long time in the low-temperature regime (large $\beta$, the inverse temperature). However, beyond this case, no rigorous lower bounds were previously known: even for the widely studied Discrete Gaussian model ($p=2$), the metastable slowdown predicted by the entropic repulsion picture had remained an open problem. On the equilibrium side, \cite{lubetzky2016harmonic} obtained sharp large-deviation principles and precise estimates of typical and maximal heights for all $1\le p&lt;\infty$, but the dynamical consequences of these results had not been established.
  Our main contribution is to close this gap by proving, for the first time, that exponentially slow mixing arising from entropic repulsion persists throughout the regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Specifically, we establish an exponential lower bound, showing that the mixing time satisfies $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}\ge e^{cL}$ for some $c&gt;0$ depending on $p$ and $\beta$. In addition, we provide a refined metastability analysis, proving that the hitting time of an intermediate level $aH(p,L)$ is at least $\exp{\left(cL^{a^{d(p)}}\right)}$, where $d(p)$ is a positive function depending on $p$. Taken together, these results demonstrate that entropic repulsion induces uniformly slow mixing across the entire $p$-SOS family, thereby extending a phenomenon that had previously been established only for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Diameter Bounds for Friends-and-Strangers Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider two $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$, where we interpret $X$ as a social network with edges representing friendships and $Y$ as a movement graph with edges representing adjacent positions. The friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is a graph on the $n!$ permutations $V(X)\to V(Y)$, where two configurations are adjacent if and only if one can be obtained from the other by swapping two friends located on adjacent positions.
  Friends-and-strangers graphs were first introduced by Defant and Kravitz, and generalize sliding puzzles as well as token swapping problems. Previous work has largely focused on their connectivity properties. In this paper, we study the diameter of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$. Our main result shows that when the underlying friendship graph is a star with $n$ vertices, the friends-and-strangers graph has components of diameter $O(n^4)$. This implies, in particular, that sliding puzzles are always solvable in polynomially many moves. Our work also provides explicit efficient algorithms for finding these solutions.
  We then extend our results to general graphs in two ways. First, we show that the diameter is polynomially bounded when both the friendship and the movement graphs have large minimum degree. Second, when both the underlying graphs $X$ and $Y$ are Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, we show that the distance between any pair of configurations is almost always polynomially bounded under certain conditions on the edge probabilities.</description>

      <title>Calibration Meets Reality: Making Machine Learning Predictions Trustworthy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

      <description>arXiv:2509.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling how networks change under structural perturbations can yield foundational insights into network robustness, which is critical in many real-world applications. The largest connected component is a popular measure of network performance. Percolation theory provides a theoretical framework to establish statistical properties of the largest connected component of large random graphs. However, this theoretical framework is typically only exact in the large-$\nodes$ limit, failing to capture the statistical properties of largest connected components in small networks, which many real-world networks are. We derive expected values for the largest connected component of small $G(\nodes,p)$ random graphs from which nodes are either removed uniformly at random or targeted by highest degree and compare these values with existing theory. We also visualize the performance of our expected values compared to existing theory for predicting the largest connected component of various real-world, small graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion for Nonlinear Filtering in the Small System Noise Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rejection sampling is a popular method used to generate numbers that follow some given distribution. We study the use of this method to generate random numbers in the unit interval from increasing probability density functions. We focus on the problem of sampling from $n$ correlated random variables from a joint distribution whose marginal distributions are all increasing. We show that, in the worst case, the expected number of random bits required to accept or reject a sample grows at least linearly and at most quadratically with $n$.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Processing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Markov Decision Processing Networks (MDPNs) as a multiclass queueing network model where service is a controlled, finite-state Markov process. The model exhibits a decision-dependent service process where actions taken influence future service availability. Viewed as a two-sided queueing model, this captures settings such as assemble-to-order systems, ride-hailing platforms, cross-skilled call centers, and quantum switches.
  We first characterize the capacity region of MDPNs. Unlike classical switched networks, the MDPN capacity region depends on the long-run mix of service states induced by the control of the underlying service process. We show, via a counterexample, that MaxWeight is not throughput-optimal in this class, demonstrating the distinction between MDPNs and classical queueing models.
  To bridge this gap, we design a weighted average reward policy, a multiobjective MDP that leverages a two-timescale separation at the fluid scale. We prove throughput-optimality of the resulting policy. The techniques yield a clear capacity region description and apply to a broad family of two-sided matching systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of trained single layer neural networks to Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative convergence of shallow neural networks trained via gradient descent to their associated Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit.
  While previous work has established qualitative convergence under broad settings, precise, finite-width estimates remain limited, particularly during training.
  We provide explicit upper bounds on the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the network output and its Gaussian approximation at any training time $t \ge 0$, demonstrating polynomial decay with network width.
  Our results quantify how architectural parameters, such as width and input dimension, influence convergence, and how training dynamics affect the approximation error.</description>

      <title>Discrete flat disks: rigid quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Ferrari in the physics context of JT gravity, we introduce and enumerate a combinatorial family of quadrangulations of the disk, called rigid quadrangulations. These form a subclass of the flat quadrangulations in the sense that every inner vertex has degree 4, and therefore it can be viewed as a discrete model of flat metrics on the disk. Our main result is a bijection between rigid quadrangulations and certain colorful integer-labeled quadrangulations of the sphere, together with a dictionary relating a variety of natural statistics on both sides. Adaptions of the bijection to various boundary conditions allow us to import recent enumerative results for colorful quadrangulation obtained by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price. We discuss some consequences of the enumeration of rigid quadrangulations for a flat version of JT gravity at finite cutoff, and comment on potential scaling limits.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for rigid quadrangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of rigid quadrangulations, recently introduced by Budd and proven to be in bijection with colorful quadrangulations. The generating function for the latter has been derived in an algebraic manner by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price, which therefore also counts rigid quadrangulations. In this paper we will provide a direct, bijective proof, for this generating function. We will relate the rigid quadrangulations to some naturally appearing trees, decorated with certain natural data. By some slight bijective manipulation of the data, we get a decorated tree, for which the generating function can be found. This result opens the door to better understand the geometry of random rigid quadrangulations (and maybe even of random colorful quadrangulations), by studying the corresponding decorated trees. These properties are relevant the formulation of UV complete JT-gravity, following the work of Ferrari.</description>

      <title>A coarse-graining theory for elliptic operators and homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a coarse-graining theory for divergence-form elliptic operators. The construction centers on a pair of coarse-grained matrices defined on spatial blocks that encode a scale-dependent notion of ellipticity, transmit precise information from small to large scales, and yield coarse-grained counterparts of standard elliptic estimates. Under simplifying assumptions, we give a complete proof of the result of [arXiv:2405.10732] that homogenization is reached within at most $C\log^2(1+\Theta)$ dyadic length scales in the high-contrast regime, where $\Theta$ is the ellipticity contrast. We argue that this scale-local notion of ellipticity is genuinely iterable across arbitrarily many scales, providing a framework for a rigorous renormalization group analysis.</description>

      <title>On domains of elliptic operators with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show how one can use recently gained insights from the study of singular SPDEs, more particularly the study of singular operators via the theory of Paracontrolled Distributions, to construct domains for (singular) elliptic operators. Formally we consider \[ A (u) \text{"$=$''} (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V \cdot \nabla u + \xi u +
  {{div} (\rho u)}, \] where $V \in \mathcal{C}^{\delta}$, $\xi \in \mathcal{C}^{- 2 + \delta}$, $\rho \in \mathcal{C}^{- 1 + \delta},{div}\rho = 0$ and which satisfy a structural assumption that is notably satisfied when $\xi$ is a "sub-critical noise". We also show that under this assumption, one can construct a continuous change of variables $\Theta$ which satisfies \[ A \Theta - (1 - \Delta) \in \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; H^{\delta'}) \] which allows us to define $A$ rigorously and parametrise a domain. Moreover, for suitably regularised operators \[ A_{\varepsilon} (u) := (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V_{\varepsilon} \cdot
  \nabla u + (\xi_{\varepsilon} + c_{\varepsilon}) u +
  {{div} (\rho_{\varepsilon} \cdot u)}, \] we show that for a strongly converging regularised change of variables $\Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow \Theta$ we have \[ A_{\varepsilon} \Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow A \Theta \text{ in }
  \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; L^2) \] which in particular implies norm resolvent convergence to a limiting closed operator.</description>

      <title>A multiscale analysis of mean-field transformers in the moderate interaction regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space, an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results with some simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Gibbs Variational Principles for Irreversible Interacting Particle Systems with Applications to Attractor Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider irreversible translation-invariant interacting particle systems on the $d$-dimensional cubic lattice with finite local state space, which admit at least one Gibbs measure as a time-stationary measure. Under some mild degeneracy conditions on the rates and the specification we prove, that zero relative entropy loss of a translation-invariant measure implies, that the measure is Gibbs w.r.t. the same specification as the time-stationary Gibbs measure. As an application, we obtain the attractor property for irreversible interacting particle systems, which says that any weak limit point of any trajectory of translation-invariant measures is a Gibbs measure w.r.t. the same specification as the time-stationary measure. This extends previously known results to fairly general irreversible interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>The genealogy of nearly critical branching processes in varying environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the spinal decomposition technique in Foutel-Rodier and Schertzer (2022) we prove a Yaglom limit law for the rescaled size of a nearly critical branching process in varying environment conditional on survival. In addition, our spinal approach allows us toprove convergence of the genealogical structure of the population at a fixed time horizon -- when the sequence of trees are envisioned as a sequence of metric spaces -- in the Gromov--Hausdorff--Prohorov (GHP) topology. We characterize the limiting metric space as a time-changed version of the Brownian coalescent point process Popovic (2004).
  Beyond our specific model, we derive several general results allowing one to go from spinal decompositions to convergence of random trees in the GHP topology. As a direct application, we show how this type of convergence naturally condenses the limit of several interesting genealogical quantities: the population size, the time to the most-recent common ancestor, the reduced tree, and the tree generated by $k$ uniformly sampled individuals. As in a recent article by the authors (Foutel-Rodier and Schertzer 2022), we hope that our specific example illustrates a general methodology that could be applied to more complex branching processes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hypercube Queueing Models with Overlapping Service Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized hypercube queueing model extending Larson's (1974) framework to overlapping service regions such as police beats. Traditional hypercube models effectively capture light-traffic systems by tracking each server's busy or idle state. However, modern service operations often operate near capacity, where each server handles only a subset of calls and queues may form. This saturation invalidates the simple binary representation and necessitates a richer state-space analysis. Our model addresses this by formulating a Markov model with non-negative integer-valued state vectors and introducing a truncated hyperlattice queueing approximation. Exploiting the sparsity of the transition matrix, we efficiently compute the steady-state distribution and demonstrate that it closely approximates the original system under canonical dispatching policies. The model enables accurate evaluation of system performance metrics and can be adapted to diverse service systems. We validate the approach through simulations on synthetic service networks and a case study of the Atlanta police operations system, which faces high workload, staffing shortages, and boundary effects. Using real 911 calls-for-service data, we find that allowing overlapping patrol regions significantly mitigates congestion and improves deployment efficiency. Although our focus is on police districting, the generalized hypercube framework applies broadly to mobile-server systems and high-load service environments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider asymptotic behaviors of multiscale multivalued stochastic systems with small noises. First of all, for general, fully coupled systems for multivalued stochastic differential equations of slow and fast motions with small noises in the slow components, we prove an averaging principle in the strong convergence sense. Moreover, a convergence rate is given in a special case. Next, for these systems, we establish the large deviation principle by the weak convergence approach. Then for a special case the rate function is explicitly characterized. Finally, we explain our results by an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Wilson loop expectations in lattice Yang-Mills models with a compact Lie group $G$. Using tools recently introduced in a companion paper, we provide alternate derivations, interpretations, and generalizations of several recent theorems about Brownian motion limits (Dahlqvist), lattice string trajectories (Chatterjee and Jafarov) and surface sums (Magee and Puder). We show further that one can express Wilson loop expectations as sums over embedded planar maps in a manner that applies to any matrix dimension $N \geq 1$, any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$, and any lattice dimension $d \geq 2$.
  When $G=\mathrm{U}(N)$, the embedded maps we consider are pairs $(\mathcal M, \phi)$ where $\mathcal M$ is a planar (or higher genus) map and $\phi$ is a graph homomorphism from $\mathcal M$ to a lattice such as $\mathbb Z^d$. The faces of $\mathcal M$ come in two partite classes: $\textit{edge-faces}$ (each mapped by $\phi$ onto a single edge) and $\textit{plaquette-faces}$ (each mapped by $\phi$ onto a single plaquette). The weight of a lattice edge $e$ is the Weingarten function applied to the partition whose parts are given by half the boundary lengths of the faces in $\phi^{-1}(e)$. (The Weingarten function becomes quite simple in the $N\to \infty$ limit.) The overall weight of an embedded map is proportional to $N^\chi$ (where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic) times the product of the edge weights. We establish analogous results for $\mathrm{SU}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{SO}(N)$, and $\mathrm{Sp}(N/2)$, where the embedded surfaces and weights take a different form. There are several variants of these constructions. In this context, we present a list of relevant open problems spanning several disciplines: random matrix theory, representation theory, statistical physics, and the theory of random surfaces, including random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) in a dynamic context where the model uncertainty is captured by penalizing potential models in function of their adapted Wasserstein distance to a given reference model. We consider both discrete- and continuous-time settings and derive dynamic duality formulas that reformulate the worst-case expectation as a tractable minimax problem. The inner maximum can be computed recursively in discrete time, or solved by a path-dependent Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation in continuous time. We further extend these duality results from the worst-case expectation to the worst-case expected shortfall, a non-linear expectation. Finally, we apply the DRO framework to optimal stopping problems in discrete time. We recast the original problem as a classical Wasserstein DRO on a nested space by introducing a novel relaxation that considers stopping times with respect to general flitrations.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the quantitative contraction rates for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with multiplicative noise. Under suitable conditions on the coefficients of the SDE, this paper derives explicit quantitative contraction rates for the convergence in Wasserstein distances of McKean-Vlasov SDEs using the coupling method.The contraction results are then used to prove a propagation of chaos uniformly in time, which provides quantitative bounds on convergence rate of interacting particle systems, and establishes exponential ergodicity for McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

Abstract: For one-dimensional diffusions on the half-line, we study a specific type of conditioning to avoid zero. We introduce supermartingales defined via concave functions with respect to the scale function. A conditioning is formulated through the exit times of the supermartingale, and its existence is shown. We also investigate the absolute continuity relations of the limit laws at time infinity.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Law-of-large numbers for the Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Volterra Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and its stationary version. Based on a fine asymptotic analysis of the corresponding Volterra Riccati equation combined with the affine transformation formula, we first show that the finite-dimensional distributions of this process are asymptotically independent. Afterwards, we prove a law-of-large numbers in $L^p$(\Omega)$ with $p \geq 2$ and show that the stationary process is ergodic. As an application, we prove the consistency of the method of moments and study the maximum-likelihood estimation for continuous and discrete high-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>Multiscaling limit theorems for stochastic FPDE with cyclic long-range dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies solutions of stochastic partial differential equations with random initial conditions. First, it overviews some of the known results on scaled solutions of such equations and provides several explicit motivating examples. Then, it proves multiscaling limit theorems for renormalized solutions for the case of initial conditions subordinated to random processes with cyclic long-range dependence. Two cases of stochastic partial differential equations are examined. The spectral and covariance representations for the corresponding limit random fields are derived. Additionally, it is discussed why analogous results are not valid for subordinated cases with Hermite ranks greater than 1. Numerical examples that illustrate the obtained theoretical results are presented.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to allow each vertex to be adjacent to \(n_v\) edges. These objects can be formulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine the case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations of tiles in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of log-correlated Gaussian processes indexed by metric spaces is introduced, when the metric is conditionally negative definite. These processes arise as the limit of bi-fractional Brownian motions indexed by $(H,K)$ scaled by $K^{-1/2}$ as $K\downarrow 0$ with $H\in(0,1/2]$ fixed. When the metric is in addition a measure definite kernel, stochastic-integral representations of the generalized processes when evaluated at a test function are provided. The introduced processes are also shown to be the scaling limits of certain aggregated models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the homogenization property of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with rapid oscillation in a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, and driven by multiplicative cylindrical Wiener noise. Using two-scale convergence, stochastic compactness and the martingale representative theory, we show the solutions of original equations converge to a solution of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible version with constant coefficients. Additionally, a corrector result is provided, which strengthens the two-scale convergence from weak to strong within an appropriate regularity framework. Several challenges arising from stochastic effect and the limited regularity induced by the density function are addressed throughout the analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to exhibiting phase transitions, we investigate the local convergence near a stationary distribution for distribution dependent stochastic differential equations. By linearizing the nonlinear Markov semigroup associated with the distribution dependent equation around the stationary distribution, the local exponential convergence of the solution is related to the exponential convergence of a semigroup of linear operators. Our result can be used as a criteria for the locally exponential stability of stationary distributions. Concrete examples, including the granular media equation with double-wells landscapes and quadratic interaction, are given to illustrate our main result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of multiscale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems where the entire system depends on the distribution of the fast component. First of all, by the Poisson equation method we prove that the slow component converges to the solution of the averaging equation in the $L^p$ ($p\geq 2$) space with the optimal convergence rate 1/2. Then a central limit theorem is established by tightness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the unique weak and strong solvability for time inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations with the drift in subcritical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder spaces $L^p([0,T];{\mathcal C}_b^{\beta}({\mathbb R}^d;{\mathbb R}^d))$ and driven by $\alpha$-stable processes for $\alpha\in (0,2)$. The weak well-posedness is derived for $\beta\in (0,1)$, $\alpha+\beta&gt;1$ and $p&gt;\alpha/(\alpha+\beta-1)$ through Prohorov's theorem, Skorohod's representation and the regularity estimates of solutions for a class of fractional parabolic partial differential equations. The pathwise uniqueness and Davie's type uniqueness are proved for $\beta&gt;1-\alpha/2$ by using It\^{o}--Tanaka's trick. Moreover, we give a counterexample to the pathwise uniqueness for the supercritical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder drifts to explain the present result is sharp.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity and Learning Lower Bounds for Hierarchical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs. We show that if each function in the hierarchy is $\varepsilon$-far from linear, the noise stability is exponentially small in the depth of the hierarchy.
  Our results have immediate applications for agnostic learning. In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014), our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostically learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions.
  We also derive similar SQ lower bounds based on the indicators of crossing events in critical site percolation. These crossing events are not formally hierarchical as we define but still have some hierarchical features as studied in mathematical physics.
  Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022), our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.
  Finally in the Gaussian setting, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021), our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostic SQ learning.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes sharp dimension-free concentration inequalities and expectation bounds for the deviation of the sum of simple random tensors from its expectation. As part of our analysis, we use generic chaining techniques to obtain a sharp high-probability upper bound on the suprema of $L_p$ empirical processes. In so doing, we generalize classical results for quadratic and product empirical processes to higher-order settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study a time-changed variant of the Erlang queue with multiple arrivals where the time-changing component used is the first hitting time of a tempered stable subordinator. The system of fractional difference-differential equations that governs its state probabilities is derived which is solved to obtain their explicit expressions. An equivalent representation in terms of phases and the mean queue length is obtained. For a particular case, the distribution of inter-arrival times, inter-phase times, sojourn times, busy period and that of conditional waiting times are derived.</description>

      <title>Stability of backward propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to introduce and establish a notion of stability for the backward propagation of chaos with respect to (initial) data sets. Consider, for example, a sequence of discrete-time martingales converging to a continuous-time limit, and a system of mean-field BSDEs that satisfies the backward propagation of chaos, i.e. converges to a sequence of i.i.d. McKean-Vlasov BSDEs. Then, we say that the backward propagation of chaos is stable if the system of mean-field BSDEs driven by the discrete-time martingales converges to the sequence of McKean-Vlasov BSDEs driven by the continuous-time limit. We consider the convergence scheme of the backward propagation of chaos as the image of the corresponding data set under which this scheme is established. Then, using an appropriate notion of convergence for data sets, we are able to show a variety of continuity properties for this functional point of view. Along the way, we also provide stability results for mean-field and McKean-Vlasov BSDEs, which are of interest in their own right, for numerical approximations of these equations.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key ingredient is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point when the initial condition is of compact support.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we observe that the dynamical approach to lattice Yang-Mills set forth in [SZZ23] may also be applied to prove Wilson's area law in the 't Hooft regime of parameters. The main point is to verify the mass gap condition from [DF80], from which area law directly follows. Our results apply for gauge groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N), \mathrm{SU}(N), \mathrm{SO}(2N)\}$, which all have nontrivial center (which is one of the key assumptions in [DF80]).</description>

Abstract: We consider Sobolev-type distances on probability measures over separable Hilbert spaces involving the Schatten-$p$ norms, which include as special cases a distance first introduced by Bourguin and Campese (2020) when $p=2$, and a distance introduced by Gin\'e and Leon (1980) when $p=\infty$. Our analysis shows that, unless $p=\infty$, these distances fail to metrize convergence in distribution in infinite dimensions. This clarifies several inconsistencies and misconceptions in the recent literature that arose from confusion between different types of distances.</description>

      <title>Conditions for equality and stability in Shannon's and Tao's entropy power inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is equality in Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) if and only if the random variables involved are Gaussian, assuming nothing beyond the existence of differential entropies. This is done by justifying de Bruijn's identity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a re-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that there exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$ such that $h(X+Y) = \infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite entropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for any independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the continuity of $t \mapsto h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then establish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's EPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a quantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under log-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a compactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality and leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>It\^o formula for reduced rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The It\^o formula, also known as the change-of-variables formula, is a cornerstone of It\^o stochastic calculus. Over time, this formula has been extended to apply to random processes for which classical calculus is insufficient. Since every random process exhibits some degree of regularity, rough path theory provides a natural framework for treating them uniformly. In this paper, we extend the It\^o formula for reduced rough paths, broadening the range of roughness from the previously known case $\frac{1}{3} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ to the more singular regime $\frac{1}{4} &lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the joint value distribution of Dirichlet $L$-functions in the critical strip $\frac{1}{2} &lt; \sigma &lt; 1$. We show that the values of distinct Dirichlet $L$-functions are dependent in the sense that they do not behave like independently distributed random variables and they prevent each other from obtaining large values. Nevertheless, we show that distinct Dirichlet $L$-functions can achieve large values simultaneously infinitely often.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical inference of the drift parameters for the Volterra Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on R in the ergodic regime. For continuous-time observations, we derive the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators and show that they are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal locally uniformly in the parameters. For the case of discrete high-frequency observations, we prove similar results by discretization of the continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, for discrete low-frequency observations, we show that the method of moments is consistent. Our proofs are crucially based on the law of large numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing of contingent claims of American style, using indifference pricing by fully dynamic convex risk measures. We provide a general definition of risk-indifference prices for buyers and sellers in continuous time, in a setting where buyer and seller have potentially different information, and show that these definitions are consistent with no-arbitrage principles. Specifying to stochastic volatility models, we characterize indifference prices via solutions of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations reflected at Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and show that this characterization provides a basis for the implementation of numerical methods using deep learning.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Robbins-Siegmund theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem is one of the most important results in stochastic optimization, where it is widely used to prove the convergence of stochastic algorithms. We provide a quantitative version of the theorem, establishing a bound on how far one needs to look in order to locate a region of \emph{metastability} in the sense of Tao. Our proof involves a metastable analogue of Doob's theorem for $L_1$-supermartingales along with a series of technical lemmas that make precise how quantitative information propagates through sums and products of stochastic processes. In this way, our paper establishes a general methodology for finding metastable bounds for stochastic processes that can be reduced to supermartingales, and therefore for obtaining quantitative convergence information across a broad class of stochastic algorithms whose convergence proof relies on some variation of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We conclude by discussing how our general quantitative result might be used in practice.</description>

      <title>Mixing Any Cocktail with Limited Ingredients: On the Structure of Payoff Sets in Multi-Objective POMDPs and its Impact on Randomised Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-dimensional payoff functions in partially observable Markov decision processes. We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies (policies) and study what kind are needed to achieve a given expected payoff vector. In general, pure strategies (i.e., not resorting to randomisation) do not suffice for this problem.
  We prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Unified MDL-based Binning and Tensor Factorization Framework for PDF Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework for weak and strong convergence of matrix models to operator-valued semicircular systems parametrized by operator-valued covariance matrices $\eta = (\eta_{i,j})_{i,j \in I}$. Non-commutative polynomials are replaced by covariance polynomials that can involve iterated applications of $\eta_{i,j}$, leading to the notion of covariance laws. We give sufficient conditions for weak and strong convergence of general Gaussian random matrices and deterministic matrices to a $B$-valued semicircular family and generators of the base algebra $B$. In particular, we obtain operator-valued strong convergence for continuously weighted Gaussian Wigner matrices, such as Gaussian band matrices with a continuous cutoff, and we construct natural strongly convergent matrix models for interpolated free group factors.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Consistency in Machine Learning and Its Connection to Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e. the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets. Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Expectation-Maximisation and Applications to Gaussian Mixture Model Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach in different settings.</description>
