      <title>Neuro-imagerie n\'eonatale : quelle valeur pr\'edictive ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premature birth and various pre- and peri-natal stresses can lead to a variety of brain lesions and have clearly been identified as major risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, with variable but multiple consequences that can significantly alter the functional outcome of children in the short, medium and long term. The main aim of the various diagnostic and prognostic markers available, based in particular on clinical and neuroimaging data, is to facilitate early detection of the various disorders and to optimise the follow-up and management of these babies at risk of deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Human Brain from the Prenatal Period to Infancy Using 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human brain development is a complex and dynamic process that begins during the first weeks of pregnancy and lasts until early adulthood. This chapter focuses on the developmental window from prenatal period to infancy, probably the most dynamic period across the entire lifespan. The availability of non-invasive three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methodologies has changed the paradigm and allows investigations of the living human brain structure - e.g. micro- and macrostructural features of cortical and subcortical regions and their connections, including cortical sulcation/gyrification, area, and thickness, as well as white matter microstructure and connectivity - beginning in utero. Because of its relative safety, MRI is well-adapted to study individuals at multiple time points and to longitudinally follow the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the early stages of cognitive development.</description>

      <title>In silico discovery of representational relationships across visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.</description>
