      <title>Free and discrete subgroups generated by two quaternionic Heisenberg translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be two Heisenberg translations of ${\rm Sp}(2,1)$ with distinct fixed points. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the subgroup $\langle A, B \rangle $ is discrete and free by using Klein's combination theorem.</description>

      <title>Applications of Borel-definable homological algebra to locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\mathrm{Hom}$ functor from the category $\mathbf{LCPAb}$ of locally compact Polish abelian groups to the category $\mathbf{PAb}$ of Polish abelian groups has a total right derived functor, improving on Hoffmann and Spitzweck's construction of its cohomological right derived functor.
  We also apply the description of the left heart of subcategories of $\mathbf{PAb}$ in terms of groups with a Polish cover and Borel-definable group homomorphisms to completely characterize the injective and projective objects in the left heart of $\mathbf{LCPAb}$, as well as in the left heart of its full subcategories spanned by: compactly generated groups, Lie groups, totally disconnected groups, topological torsion groups, topological $p$-groups, locally compact groups of finite ranks, topological torsion groups of finite ranks, topological $p$-groups of finite ranks, and type $\mathbb{A}$ groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups of the $PSL_2(q)$ Commuting Involution Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and a conjugacy class of involutions $X$ of $G$, we define the commuting involution graph $\mathcal{C}(G,X)$ to be the graph with vertex set $X$ and $x,y \in X$ adjacent if and only if $x \neq y$ and $xy =yx$. In this paper the automorphism group of the graph $\mathcal{C}(G,X)$ is determined when $G = PSL_2(q)$.</description>

      <title>Roots in the substitution group and in the group of Riordan matrices with ones in the main diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and uniqueness of iterative roots of order $n$ within the substitution group of formal power series $\mathcal J(Z)$ -- with coefficients in a commutative ring with unity $Z$ -- employing a matrix-based framework grounded in the Riordan group. We analyse the relationship between the substitution group and the Lagrange subgroup -- a group of Riordan matrices -- and explore some classic questions concerning algebraic completeness and uniqueness of root extractions. This approach allows us to obtain various results about the roots in $\mathcal J(Z)$ for different choices of $Z$. Furthermore, the examination of the substitution group facilitates the analysis of roots within the Riordan matrix group.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on the perfect kernel of higher rank generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the space of subgroups of non-amenable generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS groups) of rank $d$, that is, groups acting cocompactly on an oriented tree with vertex and edge stabilizers isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our results generalize the study of Baumslag-Solitar groups, and of GBS groups of rank $1$. We give an explicit description of the perfect kernel of a non-amenable GBS group $G$ of rank $d$ and show the existence of a partition of the perfect kernel into a countably infinite set of pieces which are invariant under the action by conjugation of $G$, and such that each piece contains a dense orbit.</description>

      <title>Rotation sets and axes in the fine curve graph for torus homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the dictionary between the action of a torus homeomorphism on the fine curve graph and its rotation set. More precisely, we show that the fixed points at infinity of a loxodromic element determine the rotation set up to scale. A key ingredient is a metric version of the classical WPD property from geometric group theory. As a consequence we find new stable criteria for positive scl, and for two homeomorphisms to generate a free group.</description>

      <title>Products of strictly hyperbolic conjugacy classes in symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a conjugacy class of the symplectic group Sp$(2n, K)$ over a field $K$ strictly hyperbolic if its minimal polynomial is of the form $q(x) q^*(x)$, where the polynomial $q(x)$ is prime to its reciprocal $q^*(x) := x^n q(x^{-1})$. It is shown that the product of 2 cyclic, strictly hyperbolic conjugacy classes of Sp$(2n, K)$ contains all nonscalar elements of Sp$(2n, K)$. It follows that the projective symplectic group has a conjugacy class of covering number 2, i.e. PSp$(2n,K) = \Omega^2$ for some conjugacy class $\Omega$ of PSp$(2n,K)$. This verifies a conjecture of J. G. Thompson in the special case of a (finite) projective symplectic group.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Technique for the Wedderburn Decomposition of Rational Group Algebras of Nested GVZ $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Topological Invariants For Unnormalized Schatten $p$ multiplicative Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result of Dadarlat shows that nonzero even rational cohomology obstructs the matricial stability of many discrete groups. In the author's previous work, 2-cohomology is used to argue that certain groups are not stable in unnormalized Schatten $p$-norms for $p &gt; 1$, although 2-cohomology is known not to obstruct stability in the unnormalized 2-norm in general. The main result of this paper demonstrates that we should not expect $2k$ cohomology to obstruct in the unnormalized Schatten $p$-norm for $p\ge k$, because the invariant in Dadarlat's argument vanishes for maps that are asymptotically multiplicative in the Schatten $p$-norm.</description>

      <title>The type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups. Invoking work of Baggett-Kleppner, we characterize the closed points of the unitary dual of such a group $G$ purely in terms of the group structure. An algebraic criterion characterizing when $G$ is a type I group is derived. We show that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of vector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the commutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are type I groups. We also discuss the type I dichotomy for $p$-torsion contraction groups, and exhibit, for each prime $p$, uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic such groups that are not type I. This answers a recently posed question by the second author. Finally, we adapt a recent construction of Chirvasitu to obtain numerous examples of two-step nilpotent torsion locally compact groups that are not type I, but that embed as closed cocompact normal subgroups in two-step nilpotent groups that are type I.</description>

      <title>Cubic Fourfolds with an Order-$7$ Automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study smooth cubic fourfolds admitting an automorphism of order $7$. It is known that the possible symplectic automorphism groups of such cubic fourfolds are precisely $F_{21}$, $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{F}_7)$, and $A_7$. In this paper, we determine all possible full automorphism groups of smooth cubic fourfolds with an automorphism of order $7$. We also investigate the moduli spaces of cubic fourfolds whose automorphism group is either $F_{21}$ or $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{F}_7)$, describing them both as GIT quotients and as locally symmetric varieties. In particular, we give an explicit description of the singular cubic fourfolds that appear in the boundary of the corresponding GIT quotients. For these two cases, we determine the commensurability classes of the monodromy groups by explicitly identifying certain arithmetic subgroups. As an interesting consequence, we prove that the period domain for cubic fourfolds equipped with an order-$7$ automorphism is isogenous to a Hilbert modular surface.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in braid groups and Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study several natural decision problems in braid groups and Artin groups. We classify the Artin groups with decidable submonoid membership problem in terms of the non-existence of certain forbidden induced subgraphs of the defining graph. Furthermore, we also classify the Artin groups for which the following problems are decidable: the rational subset membership problem, semigroup intersection problem, and the fixed-target submonoid membership problem. In the case of braid groups our results show that the submonoid membership problem, and each and every one of these problems, is decidable in the braid group $\mathbf{B}_n$ if and only if $n \leq 3$, which answers an open problem of Potapov (2013). Our results also generalize and extend results of Lohrey &amp; Steinberg (2008) who classified right-angled Artin groups with decidable submonoid (and rational subset) membership problem.</description>
