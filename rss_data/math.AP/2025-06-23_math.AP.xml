      <title>Propagation of chaos for the Landau equation with very soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process of $N$ stochastic particles and show that its empirical measure converges, as $N\rightarrow\infty$, to the solution of the Landau equation. We work in the regime of very soft potentials, which had never been covered before, using a tightness/uniqueness method. To claim uniqueness, we need high integrability estimates that we obtain by crucially exploiting the dissipation of the Fisher information at the level of the particle system. To be able to exploit these estimates as $N\rightarrow\infty$, we prove the affinity in infinite dimension of the entropy production and Fisher information dissipation (and general higher-order versions of the Fisher information through an abstract theorem), results which were up to now only known for the entropy and the Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Sharp Well-Posedness and Parameter Asymptotics for a Nonlocal Model of Thin Film Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the mathematical analysis of the Cauchy problem associated with a two-dimensional equation describing the dynamics of a thin fluid film flowing down an inclined flat plate under the influence of gravity and an electric field. As a first objective, we study the sharp global well-posedness of solutions within the framework of Sobolev spaces. Specifically, we show that the equation is well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for $s&gt;-2$, and ill-posed for $s&lt;-2$. Our main contribution is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions with respect to the physical parameters of the model. This behavior is not only of mathematical interest but also of physical relevance. We rigorously show that, as the effects of the electric field vanish and the inclination angle increases, the model converges to a related one describing thin film flow down a vertical plane.</description>

      <title>Crystalline elastic flow of polygonal curves: long time behaviour and convergence to stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a planar crystalline anisotropy, we study the crystalline elastic flow of immersed polygonal curves, possibly also unbounded. Assuming that the segments evolve by parallel translation (as it happens in the standard crystalline curvature flow), we prove that a unique regular flow exists until a maximal time when some segments having zero crystalline curvature disappear. Furthermore, for closed polygonal curves, we analyze the behaviour at the maximal time, and show that it is possible to restart the flow finitely many times, yielding a globally in time evolution, that preserves the index of the curve. Next, we investigate the long-time properties of the flow using a Lojasiewicz-Simon-type inequality, and show that, as time tends to infinity, the flow fully converges to a stationary curve. We also provide a complete classification of the stationary solutions and a partial classification of the translating solutions in the case of the square anisotropy.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of the non-local Massari functional and applications to inhomogeneous Allen-Cahn equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several asymptotic results concerning the non-local Massari Problem for sets with prescribed mean curvature. In particular, we show that the fractional Massari functional $\Gamma$-converges to the classical one, and this convergence preserves minimizers in the $L^1_{\mbox{loc}}$-topology. This returns useful information about the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the inhomogeneous Allen-Cahn equation in the forced and the mass-prescribed settings. In this context, a new geometric object, which we refer to as "non-local hybrid mean curvature", naturally appears.</description>

      <title>Average estimate for Eigenfunctions along geodesics in the quantum completely integrable case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the upper bound of the integral of $L^2$-normalized joint eigenfunctions over geodesics in a two-dimensional quantum completely integrable system. For admissible geodesics, we rigorously establish an asymptotic decay rate of $O(h^{1/2}|\ln h|^{1/2})$. This represents a polynomial improvement over the previously well known $O(1)$ bound.</description>

      <title>Transporting a Dirac mass in a mean field planning problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mean field planning problem in which the initial density is a Dirac mass. We show that there exists a unique solution which converges to a self-similar profile as time tends to $0$. We proceed by studying a continuous rescaling of the solution, and characterizing its behavior near the initial time through an appropriate Lyapunov functional.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of a perturbation problem for the Abels-Garcke-Gr\"un model in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Abels-Garcke-Gr\"un model that describes the motion of two viscous incompressible fluids with unmatched densities in the presence of a uniform gravitational field. For the perturbated system with respect to a given equilibrium state in three dimensions, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of a strong solution using a suitable iteration scheme and the energy method. This work lays the foundation for further studies on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem of nonhomogeneous two-phase flows within the framework of diffuse interface models.</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequality and its extremal functions for homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=(X_1,X_{2},\ldots,X_m)$ be a system of homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we establish connections between the volume growth rate set of subunit balls and the admissible conjugate Sobolev exponents set on arbitrary open subsets $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. By analyzing further properties of these sets, we derive Sobolev inequalities and provide explicit conditions for the optimality of the corresponding Sobolev exponents, particularly for bounded and certain classes of unbounded domains. Furthermore, by developing a refined concentration-compactness lemma, specifically adapted to degenerate cases, we prove that the optimal Sobolev constant is attained when the maximal level set of the pointwise homogeneous dimension is spanned by the translation directions of $X$.</description>

      <title>Critical curve for the weakly coupled system of damped wave equations with mixed nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to consider the Cauchy problem for a weakly coupled system of semi-linear damped wave equations with mixed nonlinear terms. Our main objective is to draw conclusions about the critical curve of this problem using tools from Harmonic Analysis. Precisely, we obtain a new critical curve $pq = 1+ \frac{2}{n}$ for $n =1,2$ by proving global (in time) existence of small data Sobolev solutions when $pq &gt; 1 +\frac{2}{n}$ and blow-up of weak solutions in finite time even for small data when $pq &lt; 1+ \frac{2}{n}$ for $n \geq 1$. From this, we infer the impact of the nonlinearities of time derivative-type on the critical curve associated with the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Leray- Trudinger Type inequality in the anisotropic setting induced by a strongly convex Finsler norm F. The result generalizes classical exponential integrability inequalities for Sobolev functions to the framework of anisotropic Sobolev spaces $W^{1,n}_0(\Omega)$, where the standard Euclidean norm is replaced by F and associated polar norm $F^o$. Moreover, in the class of anisotropically radial functions, we obtain the optimal constant in the spirit of Moser's sharp inequality.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for 2D compressible radially symmetric Navier-Stokes equations with swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the radially symmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations with swirl in two-dimensional disks, where the shear viscosity coefficient \(\mu = \text{const}&gt; 0\), and the bulk one \(\lambda = \rho^\beta(\beta&gt;0)\). When \(\beta \geq 1\), we prove the global existence and asymptotic behavior of the large strong solutions for initial values that allow for vacuum. One of the key ingredients is to show the uniform boundedness of the density independent of the time. When \(\beta\in(0,1)\), we prove the same conclusion holds when the initial value satisfies \(\norm{\rho_0}_{L^\infty} \leq a_0\), where \(a_0\) is given by \eqref{def a_0} as in Theorem \ref{Thm3}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the global existence of large strong solutions for 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equation with real non-slip (non Navier-slip) boundary conditions when $\beta\ge1$ and the first result on the global existence of strong solutions when $\beta\in(0,1)$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions for matrix-valued two-phase harmonic map flows with optimal lifespan, which arises as the limiting system of the matrix-valued Rubinstein-Sternberg-Keller problem studied by ({\em Invent. Math.}, 233(1):1--80, 2023). Our approach employs a modified minimizing movement scheme, discretizing the time domain and constructing approximate solutions by interpolating solutions to the associated functional problem within each small time interval.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for higher order schr\"odinger operators with threshold eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;2m$, $m\in \mathbb N$ when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue. We adapt our recent results for $m\geq 1$ when $n&gt;4m$ to lower dimensions $2m&lt;n\leq 4m$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue and no resonances, the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-1}$ when $n$ is odd and $1\leq p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-2}$ when $n$ is even. We further show that if the zero energy eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x^\alpha V(x)$ for all $|\alpha|&lt;k_0$, then the wave operators are bounded on $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m-k_0}$ when $k_0&lt;2m$ in all dimensions $n&gt;2m$. The range is $p\in [1,\infty)$ and $p\in[1,\infty]$ when $k_0=2m$ and $k_0&gt;2m$ respectively. The proofs apply in the classical $m=1$ case as well and streamlines existing arguments in the eigenvalue only case, in particular the $L^\infty(\mathbb R^n)$ boundedness is new when $n&gt;3$.</description>

We avoid the use of a monotonicity formula (which is unknown if $p \neq 2$) by using a blow-up argument instead.</description>

Using the lower and upper solutions method combined with the Brouwer fixed point theorem we demonstrate the existence of a positive solution and obtain the desired solution by using a sequence of solutions to a sequence of nonsingular second-order equations and passing to the limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with a problem which describes tuberculosis granuloma formation \begin{align*} \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v) - uv - u + \beta, &amp;x \in \Omega,\ t&gt;0, \\  v_t = \Delta v + v -uv + \mu w, &amp;x \in \Omega,\ t&gt;0, \\  w_t = \Delta w + uv - wz - w, &amp;x \in \Omega,\ t&gt;0, \\  z_t = \Delta z - \nabla \cdot (z \nabla w) + f(w)z -z, &amp;x \in \Omega,\ t&gt;0 \end{cases} \end{align*} under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and initial conditions, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\ge 2$) is a smooth bounded domain, $\beta,\mu&gt;0$ and $f$ is some function, and shows that if initial data are small in some sense then the solution $(u,v,w,z)$ of the problem exists globally and convergences to $(\beta,0,0,0)$ exponentially when $\beta&gt;1$ and the reproduction number $R_0 := \frac{\mu \beta + 1}{\beta}$ satisfies $R_0&lt;1$.</description>

Abstract: We find a large solution to a semilinear Dirichlet problem in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain for a non-local operator $\phi(-\Delta\vert_{D})$, an extension of the infinitesimal generator of a subordinate killed Brownian motion. The setting covers and extends the case of the spectral fractional Laplacian. The upper bound for the explosion rate of the large solution is obtained, and is given in terms of the renewal function, distance to the boundary, and the Keller-Osserman-type transformation of the semilinearity. Additionally, we prove interior higher regularity results for this operator.</description>

      <title>Controllability of a Fluid-Structure Interaction System Governed by the Heat and Damped Beam Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the null-controllability and observability properties of a bi-dimensio\-nal fluid-structure interaction system, governed by the heat equation coupled with the damped beam equation. To do so, we prove a global Carleman estimate for the coupled system, making explicit the dependence on the damping parameter. In the course of the study, we demonstrate several inequalities for the beam equation alone, valid for different damping parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Density estimates for Ginzburg-Landau energies with degenerate double-well potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Allen-Cahn equations associated with Ginzburg-Landau energies involving degenerate double-well potentials that vanish of order $m$ at the minima \begin{equation}
  J(v,\Omega)=\int_{\Omega}\Big\{|\nabla v|^{p}+(1-v^{2})^{m}\Big\}dx,\quad 1&lt;p&lt;m, \end{equation} and establish density estimates for the level sets of nontrivial minimizers $|v| \leq 1$. This extends a result of Dipierro-Farina-Valdinoci where the density estimates for such degenerate potentials were obtained for a bounded range of $m$'s. The original estimates for the classical case $p=m=2$ were established by Caffarelli-C\'ordoba.</description>

      <title>Large-amplitude periodic solutions to the steady Euler equations with piecewise constant vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider steady solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in a two-dimensional channel with rigid walls. The flow consists of two periodic layers of constant vorticity separated by an unknown interface. Using global bifurcation theory, we rigorously construct curves of solutions that terminate either with stagnation on the interface or when the conformal equivalence between one of the layers and a strip breaks down in a $C^1$ sense. We give numerical evidence that, depending on parameters, these occur either as a corner forming on the interface or as one of the layers developing regions of arbitrarily thin width. Our proof relies on a novel formulation of the problem as an elliptic system for the velocity components in each layer, conformal mappings for each layer, and a horizontal distortion which makes these mappings agree on the interface. This appears to be the first local formulation for a multi-layer problem which allows for both overhanging wave profiles and stagnation points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the optimal higher-order Sobolev inequality $H_k^2(M^n)\hookrightarrow L^{\frac{2n}{n-2k}}(M^n)$ on a closed Riemannian manifold when the remainder term is the $L^2-$norm. Unlike the case $k=1$, the optimal inequality does not hold in general for $k&gt;1$. We prove conditions for the validity and non-validity that depend on the geometry of the manifold. Our conditions are sharp when $k=2$ and in small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Shock formation in 1D conservation laws I: Inviscid structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability and structure of shock formation in 1D hyperbolic conservation laws. We show that shock formation is stable near shocking simple waves: perturbations form a shock nearby in spacetime. We also characterize the boundary of the classical development in a spacetime neighborhood of the first time singularity. Finally, we describe the precise nature of nondegenerate shock formation through an expansion in homogeneous functions of fractional degree. We use these results in a companion paper to study the vanishing viscosity limit near shock formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting \cite{strz3}, we define generalized $p$-harmonic maps into Riemannian homogeneous targets, a notion of solutions not belonging to the energy space. Restricting our attention to the subcritical range $p$ greater than the domain dimension $n$, we show a uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity result for a sequence of such maps in the limit $p \searrow n$, assuming a uniform $n$-energy bound on its elements. The method of the proof follows the exact same lines as in \cite{strz3} but we need to check uniformity of estimates not previously considered there.</description>

      <title>Shock formation in 1D conservation laws II: Vanishing viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of weak viscosity on shock formation in 1D hyperbolic conservation laws. Given an inviscid solution that forms a nondegenerate shock, we add a small viscous regularization and study the limit as the viscosity vanishes. Using a matched asymptotic expansion, we determine the sharp rate of convergence in strong norms up to the time of inviscid shock formation, and we identify universal viscous behavior near the first singularity. To treat the complex interactions between multiple characteristics and the viscosity, we develop an approximation scheme that exploits a certain decoupling between shocking and nonshocking characteristics. Our analysis makes minimal assumptions on the equation, and in particular applies to the compressible Navier--Stokes equations with degenerate physical viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize Sacks-Uhlenbeck's existence result for harmonic spheres, constructing for $n \ge 2$, regular, non-trivial, $n$-harmonic $n$-spheres into suitable target manifolds. We obtain an infinite family of new null-homotopic such maps. The proof follows a similar perturbative argument, which in high dimensions leads to a degenerate and double-phase-type Euler-Lagrange system, making the uniform regularity needed to formalize the bubbling harder to achieve. Then, we develop a refined neck-analysis leading to an energy identity along the approximation, assuming a suitable Struwe-type entropy bound along a sequence of critical points. Finally, we combine these results to solve quite general min-max problems for the $n$-energy modulo bubbling.</description>

      <title>The effect of target orientation on the mean first passage time of a Brownian particle to a small elliptical absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a high order asymptotic expansion for the mean first passage time (MFPT) of the capture of Brownian particles by a small elliptical trap in a bounded two dimensional region. This new result describes the effect that trap orientation plays on the capture rate and extends existing results that give information only on the role of trap position on the capture rate. Our results are validated against numerical simulations which confirm the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation. In the case of the unit disk domain, we identify a bifurcation such that the high order correction to the global MFPT (GMFPT) is minimized when the trap is orientated in the radial direction for traps centered at $0&lt;r&lt;r_c :=\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}$. When centered at position $r_c&lt;r&lt;1$, the GMFPT correction is minimized by orientating the trap in the angular direction. In the scenario of a general two-dimensional geometry, we identify the orientation that minimizes the GMFPT in terms of the regular part of the Neumann Green's function. This theory is demonstrated on several regular domains such as disks, ellipses and rectangles.</description>

Abstract: We study the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in dimension $2$ : \[ \partial_t u + \partial_x \left( \Delta u + u^3 \right) = 0 \] where $u : (t, (x, y)) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto u(t, x, y) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2$ is the full Laplacian. We prove that solutions for small and localized initial data scatter for large time. Our proof relies on the method of space-time resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an Alhfors-regularity result for minimizers of a multiphase optimal design problem. It is a variant of the classical variational problem which involves a finite number of chambers $\mathcal{E}(i)$ of prescribed volume that partition a given domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. The cost functional associated with a configuration $\left(\{\mathcal{E}(i)\}_i,u\right)$ is made up of the perimeter of the partition interfaces and a Dirichlet energy term, which is discontinuous across the interfaces. We prove that the union of the optimal interfaces is $(n-1)$-Alhfors-regular via a penalization method and decay estimates of the energy.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple Black Holes from Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations that contain no trapped surfaces, yet whose future development admits multiple causally independent trapped surfaces. Assuming the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, this implies the formation of multiple black holes in finite time. The initial data are obtained by surgically modifying a vacuum geometrostatic manifold equipped with the Brill-Lindquist metric: the data agree exactly with the Brill-Lindquist metric outside a collection of balls centered at its multiple poles, and each ball is replaced by a constant-time slice of a well-prepared dynamical spacetime. The construction is based on Christodoulou's short-pulse framework, a stability analysis in the finite future of the short-pulse region, the geometry of geometrostatic manifolds with small mass and large separation, and the obstruction-free annular gluing method developed by Mao-Oh-Tao. The absence of trapped surfaces in the initial data is verified via a standard mean curvature comparison argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of heterotopic energy defined as the limit of Sobolev energies of Sobolev mappings in a given homotopy class approximating almost everywhere a given Sobolev mapping. We show that the heterotopic energy is finite if and only if the mappings in the corresponding homotopy classes are homotopic on a codimension one skeleton of a triangulation of the domain. When this is the case, the heterotopic energy of a mapping is the sum of its Sobolev energy and its disparity energy, defined as the minimum energy of a bubble to pass between these homotopy classes. At the more technical level, we rely on a framework that works when the target and domain manifolds are not simply connected and there is no canonical isomorphism between homotopy groups with different basepoints.</description>

Abstract: In two dimensions, we consider the problem of reconstructing a vector field from partial knowledge of its zeroth and first moment ray transforms. Different from existing works the data is known on a subset of lines, namely the ones intersecting a given arc. The problem is non-local and, for partial data, severely ill-posed. We present a reconstruction method which recovers the vector field in the convex hull of the arc. An algorithm based on this method is implemented on some numerical experiments. While still ill-posed the discretization stabilizes the numerical reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a self-gravitating perfect relativistic fluid satisfying the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of a weak null terminal spacetime singularity. This type of singularities is expected in the interior of generic dynamical black holes. In the vacuum case, weak null singularities have been constructed locally by Luk, where the metrics extend continuously to the singularities while the Christoffel symbols fail to be square integrable in any neighborhood of any point on the singular boundaries. We prove that this type of singularities persists in the presence of a self-gravitating fluid. Moreover, using the fact that the speed of sound is strictly less than the speed of light, we prove that the fluid variables also extend continuously to the singularity.</description>

      <title>Comparison of substructured non-overlapping domain decomposition and overlapping additive Schwarz methods for large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Helmholtz problems discretized with high-order finite elements is notoriously difficult, especially in 3D where direct factorization of the system matrix is very expensive and memory demanding, and robust convergence of iterative methods is difficult to obtain. Domain decomposition methods (DDM) constitute one of the most promising strategy so far, by combining direct and iterative approaches: using direct solvers on overlapping or non-overlapping subdomains, as a preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method on the original Helmholtz system or as an iterative solver on a substructured problem involving field values or Lagrange multipliers on the interfaces between the subdomains. In this work we compare the computational performance of non-overlapping substructured DDM and Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz (ORAS) preconditioners for solving large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple sources, as is encountered, e.g., in frequency-domain Full Waveform Inversion. We show on a realistic geophysical test-case that, when appropriately tuned, the non-overlapping methods can reduce the convergence gap sufficiently to significantly outperform the overlapping methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1311.7549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N\geq 1$ and $s\in (0,1)$. In the present work we characterize bounded open sets $\Omega$ with $ C^2$ boundary (\textit{not necessarily connected}) for which the following overdetermined problem \begin{equation*} ( -\Delta)^s u = f(u) \text{ in $\Omega$,} \qquad u=0 \text{ in $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Omega$,} \qquad(\partial_{\eta})_s u=Const. \text{ on $\partial \Omega$} \end{equation*} has a nonnegative and nontrivial solution, where $\eta $ is the outer unit normal vectorfield along $\partial\Omega$ and for $x_0\in\partial\Omega$ \[ \left(\partial_{\eta}\right)_{s}u(x_{0})=-\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{u(x_{0}-t\eta(x_0))}{t^s}. \]
  Under mild assumptions on $f$, we prove that $\Omega$ must be a ball. In the special case $f\equiv 1$, we obtain an extension of Serrin's result in 1971. The fact that $\Omega$ is not assumed to be connected is related to the nonlocal property of the fractional Laplacian.
  The main ingredients in our proof are maximum principles and the method of moving planes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.01917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the overdetermined problem for a large family of non-local operators given by generators of subordinate Brownian motions. In particular, this family includes the fractional Laplacian, relativistic stable operators etc. We consider these problems in bounded domains, exterior domains, and in annular domains and we show that under suitable conditions, the domains and solutions are both radially symmetric. Our method uses both analytic and probabilistic tools.</description>

      <title>Higher order Schauder estimates for degenerate or singular parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the analysis initiated in [AFV24] establishing some higher order $C^{k+2,\alpha}$ Schauder estimates ($k \in \mathbb{N}$) for a a class of parabolic equations with weights that are degenerate/singular on a characteristic hyperplane. The $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimates are obtained through a blow-up argument and a Liouville theorem, while the higher order estimates are obtained by a fine iteration procedure. As a byproduct, we present two applications. First, we prove similar Schauder estimates when the degeneracy/singularity of the weight occurs on a regular hypersurface of cylindrical type. Second, we provide an alternative proof of the higher order boundary Harnack principles established in [BG16,Kuk22].</description>

Abstract: We analyze the sharpness of the Sobolev order for left-invariant vector fields on compact Riemannian manifolds. Utilizing techniques from pseudo-differential operator theory and microlocal analysis, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues associated with these vector fields.

      <title>Vanishing viscosity solution to a 2 x 2 system of conservation laws with linear damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems of the first order partial differential equations with singular solutions appear in many multiphysics problems and the weak formulation of solutions involve in many cases product of distributions. In this paper we study such a system derived from Eulerian droplet model for air particle flow. This is a 2 x 2 non - strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws with linear damping. We first study a regularized viscous system with variable viscosity term and obtain a weak asymptotic solution with general initial data and also get solution in the Colombeau algebra. We also study the vanishing viscosity limit and show that this limit is a distribution solution. Further we study the large time asymptotic behaviour of the viscous system. This important system, is not very well studied due to complexities in the analysis. As far as we know the only work done on this system is for Riemann type of initial data. The significance of this paper is that we work on the system having general initial data and not just initial data of the Riemann type.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Time-Dependent Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel Feynman-Kac formula and investigate learning-based methods for approximating general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations which may be high-dimensional. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose learning-based approaches for numerical approximations. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct numerical experiments in both low- and high-dimensional settings, complemented by a convergence analysis. These results address the open problem concerning deep-BSDE methods for numerical approximations of high-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (cf. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15 (2018), pp. 8505-8510] and [Frontiers Sci. Awards Math. (2024), pp. 1-14] by Han, Jentzen, and E).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fractional Plateau's problem dealing with sets with prescribed non-local mean curvature. This problem can be seen as a non-local counterpart of the classical Massari's Problem. We obtain existence and regularity results, relying on a suitable version of the non-local theory for almost minimal sets. In this framework, the fractional curvature term in the energy functional can be interpreted as a perturbation of the fractional perimeter. In addition, we also discuss stickiness phenomena for non-local almost minimal sets.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity theory of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in a Lipschitz domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u=f(X)\cdot u^{-\gamma} \end{equation} in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, with the Dirichlet boundary condition and a positive, bounded function $f(X)$. A distinguishing feature is that the vanishing boundary condition introduces a singularity in the equation.
  We focus on the well-posedness of the equation and the growth rate of solutions near the boundary. The key is to classify the limiting cone of a boundary point into three categories based on its "frequency", and obtain distinct growth rate estimates for each case.
  Additionally, we discuss the boundary Harnack principle for the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation, which is essential in deriving the boundary growth rate estimate. To our knowledge, the boundary Harnack principle we derive is the first Kemper-type estimate for singular semi-linear equations. It notably differs from the classical one for linear equations, in particular, the boundedness of the ratio \(u/v\) does not imply its continuity.
  To address the lack of a suitable upper barrier, we introduce new techniques, including constructing upper barriers iteratively. We also construct a subharmonic auxiliary function $V(X)$ related to the solution $u$ in the limiting cone. The growth rate of $u(X)$ is then obtained inductively from the growth rate of the auxiliary function $V(X)$. Our results and methods offer novel insights into the behavior of singular elliptic equations in non-smooth domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work deals with a Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with potential consumption, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for cell density and chemical signal, and of Dirichlet type for the velocity field, over a bounded three-dimensional domain.
  The paper aims to develop a time discretization scheme converging to weak solutions of the system,
  which are uniformly bounded at infinite time.
  While global existence results are already known for simplified cases, either in absence of fluid flow or for linear consumption, the existence of global weak solutions for the fully coupled system with potential consumption has remained as an open problem.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of highly concentrated vorticity around rings in the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations is studied in a regime for which the leapfrogging dynamics predicted by Helmholtz is expected to occur. We provide in this paper the first result deriving this phenomenon for a general class of initial data in the suitable regime. The singular interaction of rings requires significant improvements of weak and strong localization estimates obtained in prior works. Our method is based on the combination of a new variational argument and a recently introduced double iterative procedure.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniqueness of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem has been a long standing problem in convex geometry. In the groundbreaking paper by Brendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos (Acta Math, {\bf219}, 2017), a full uniqueness result was shown for the subcritical exponents $p\in(-n-1,1]$. In the supercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even on the planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews in (J. Amer. Math. Soc., {\bf16}, 2003), where he established that the uniqueness holds in the range $p\in(-7,-2)$ and fails to hold for the other supercritical exponents $p\in(-\infty,-7)$. In this paper, we study the same uniqueness problem in the full supercritical range $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher dimensional cases $n\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\S}^n$. The uniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426), where non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions have been constructed for all $p\in(-\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general solutions which may not be symmetric, the uniqueness set $\Gamma$ of $p$ for which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed in the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.</description>

Then we prove those properties of the acoustic single layer potential that are necessary to analyze the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ and solutions in the space of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$, \textit{i.e.}, in a space of functions that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Namely, a Neumann problem that does not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamical restriction for Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a dynamical restriction principle, asserting that every restriction estimate satisfied by the Fourier transform in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is also valid for the propagator of certain Schr\"odinger equations. We consider smooth Hamiltonians with an at most quadratic growth, and also a class of nonsmooth Hamiltonians, encompassing potentials that are Fourier transforms of complex (finite) Borel measures. Roughly speaking, if the initial datum belongs to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for $p$ in a suitable range of exponents, the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ (for each fixed $t$, with the exception of certain particular values) can be meaningfully restricted to compact curved submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The underlying property responsible for this phenomenon is the boundedness of the propagator $L^p\to(\mathcal{F}L^p)_{\rm loc}$, with $1\leq p\leq2$, which is derived from almost diagonalization and dispersive estimates in function spaces defined in terms of wave packet decompositions in phase space.</description>

      <title>Modified wave operators for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one space dimension with large scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct modified wave operators for the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in one space dimension without size restriction on scattering data. In the proof, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the linearization of the NLS around a prescribed asymptotic profile. For the linearized equation which is a system of Schr\"odinger equations with non-symmetric, time-dependent long-range potentials, we show a modified energy identity, as well as an associated energy estimate, which allow us to apply a simple energy method to construct the modified wave operators. As a byproduct, we also obtain in the focusing case an improved explicit upper bound for the size of scattering data to ensure the existence of modified wave operators. Our argument relies neither on the complete integrability nor on the smoothness of nonlinearity, and also works for short-range perturbations of the cubic nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a functional defined on the class of piecewise constant functions, combining a jump penalization, which discourages discontinuities, with a fidelity term that penalizes deviations from a given linear function, called the forcing term.
  In one dimension, it is not difficult to see that local minimizers form staircases that approximate the forcing term. Here we show that in two dimensions symmetry breaking occurs, leading to the emergence of exotic minimizers whose level sets are not simple stripes with boundaries orthogonal to the gradient of the forcing term.
  The proof relies on a suitable adaptation of the calibration method for free discontinuity problems; as a side benefit, our version requires less regularity than the classical one.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity results in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces for linear elliptic equations with $L^1$- or measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been well known that if $\Omega$ is a bounded $C^1$-domain in $\R^n,\ n \ge 2$, then for every Radon measure $f$ on $\Omega$ with finite total variation, there exists a unique weak solution $u\in W_0^{1,1}(\Omega )$ of the Poisson equation $-\Delta u=f$ in $\Omega$ satisfying $\nabla u \in L^{n/(n-1),\infty}(\Omega;\R^n )$. In this paper, optimal regularity properties of the solution $u$ are established in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces $L_{\alpha}^{p,q}(\Omega )$ of order $ \alpha$ less than but arbitrarily close to $2$. More precisely, for any $0 \le \alpha&lt;1$, we show that $u\in L_{\alpha+1}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$, where $p(\alpha )= n/(n-1+\alpha )$. Moreover, using an embedding result for Sobolev-Lorentz spaces $L_{\alpha}^{p,q}(\Omega )$ into classical Besov spaces $B_\alpha^{p,q}(\Omega )$, we deduce that $u\in B_{\alpha+1}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$. Indeed, these regularity results are proved for solutions of the Dirichlet problems for more general linear elliptic equations with nonhomogeneous boundary data.
  On the other hand, it is known that if $\Omega$ is of class $C^{1,1}$, then for each $G\in L^1 (\Omega ;\R^n )$ there exists a unique very weak solution $v\in L^{n/(n-1),\infty} (\Omega )$ of $-\Delta v= {\rm div}\, G$ in $\Omega$ satisfying the boundary condition $v=0$ in some sense. We prove that $v$ has the optimal regularity property, that is, $v\in L_{\alpha}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )\cap B_{\alpha}^{p(\alpha),\infty}(\Omega )$ for every $0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. This regularity result is also proved for more general equations with nonhomogeneous boundary data.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of global large-data solutions for the Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the Cauchy problem for the classical Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes (CNS) system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong, classical, and arbitrarily smooth solutions under large initial data, which has not been addressed in the existing literature. The key idea is to first derive an entropy-energy estimate for initial data with low regularity, by leveraging the intrinsic entropy structure of the system. Building on this foundation, we then obtain higher-order energy estimates for smoother initial data via a bootstrap argument, in which the parabolic nature of the CNS system plays a crucial role in the iterative control of regularity.</description>

      <title>Tracking Brownian fluid particles in large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Rust Implementation of Finite Element Exterior Calculus on Coordinate-Free Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of a novel finite element library in Rust based on the principles of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). The library solves partial differential equations formulated using differential forms on abstract, coordinate-free simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions, employing an intrinsic Riemannian metric derived from edge lengths via Regge Calculus. We focus on solving elliptic Hodge-Laplace eigenvalue and source problems on the nD de Rham complex. We restrict ourselves to first-order Whitney basis functions. The implementation is partially verified through convergence studies.</description>
