      <title>A Naive Encoding of Russell's Paradox in Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Russell's paradox is the most easily understandable way to illustrate the inconsistency of na\"ive set theory. This note proposes a direct encoding of Russell's paradox with type-in-type universe, sigma types, and either extensional identity or intensional identity with the uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP).</description>

      <title>Satisfiability in {\L}ukasiewicz logic and its unbounded relative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unbounded {\L}ukasiewicz logic is a substructural logic that combines features of infinite-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic with those of abelian logic. The logic is finitely strongly complete w.r.t.~the additive $\ell$-group on the reals expanded with a distinguished element $-1$. We show that the existential theory of this structure is NP-complete. This provides a complexity upper bound for the set of theorems and the finite consequence relation of unbounded {\L}ukasiewicz logic. The result is obtained by reducing the problem to the existential theory of the MV-algebra on the reals, the standard semantics of {\L}ukasiewicz logic. This provides a new connection between both logics. The result entails a translation of the existential theory of the standard MV-algebra into itself.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Also they posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to generalize the link between Heyting algebras and Nelson algebras, established independently by Fidel and Vakarelov at the end of the 1970s, in the framework of bounded distributive hemi-implicative lattices. For this purpose, we introduce the variety of hemi-Nelson algebras. Moreover, we characterize the lattice of congruences of a hemi-Nelson algebra in terms of certain implicative filters. We also esta\-blish an equivalence between the algebraic category of bounded distributive hemi-implicative lattices and the one of centered hemi-Nelson algebras.</description>

Abstract: We construct a model of $\mathsf{MA_{\aleph_1}}+\mathsf{OCA}_T$ where Baumgartner's Axiom fails, settling a question of Farah. Moreover, in the same model there is an $\aleph_1$-dense set of reals which is neither reversible nor increasing, answering a question of Marun, Shelah, and Switzer.</description>

      <title>Towards a Simplified Theory of Double Boolean Algebras: Axioms and Topological Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Boolean algebras (dBas), introduced by Wille, are based on twenty-three identities. We present a simplified axiom system, the D-core algebra, and prove it is equivalent to Wille's original definition. This reduction allows improved structural results, including a refined Boolean representation theorem showing fewer conditions suffice to represent a dBa as a pair of Boolean algebras linked by adjoint maps. We generalize the glued-sum construction to possibly overlapping Boolean algebras, characterize them via a generalized order, and establish a Stone-type topological representation: every dBa is quasi-isomorphic to a dBa of clopen subsets of a Stone space. Simplified logical systems for contextual and pure dBas are developed with soundness and completeness.</description>

      <title>Iterating PP-packages without Choice: A Cohen symmetric seed and a localization framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Partition Principle $\mathsf{PP}$ asserts that whenever there is a surjection $A\twoheadrightarrow B$, there is an injection $B\hookrightarrow A$. Russell conjectured in 1906 that $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice $\mathsf{AC}$; while $\mathsf{AC}\Rightarrow \mathsf{PP}$ is immediate, the converse has remained open. We show that $\mathsf{PP}$ does not imply $\mathsf{AC}$ by constructing a transitive model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  Starting from a Cohen symmetric model $\mathcal{N}$ of $\mathrm{Add}(\omega,\omega_1)$ built with a countable-support symmetry filter, we fix parameters $S:=A^\omega$ and $T:=\mathcal{P}(S)$ and perform a class-length countable-support symmetric iteration. At successor stages we use orbit-symmetrized packages that split targeted surjections, yielding $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T$ and $\mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, while preserving $\mathsf{DC}$ and ensuring that $A$ remains non-well-orderable. A diagonal-cancellation/diagonal-lift infrastructure supplies a proper $\omega_1$-complete normal filter at limit stages. Finally, Ryan--Smith localization shows that under $\mathsf{SVC}^+(T)$, $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T \wedge \mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, so the final model satisfies $\mathsf{PP}$ but not $\mathsf{AC}$.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Unital Classification Theorem for $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the $KK$-equivalence relation on unital $C^*$-algebras, in the sense of descriptive set theory. We prove that $KK$-equivalence is analytic, which in turn shows that the set of separable $C^*$-algebras satisfying the UCT is analytic. This allows us to prove a game-theoretic refinement of the unital classification theorem: there is a transfer of strategies between Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games (of various lengths) on classifiable $C^*$-algebras and their invariants.</description>

      <title>Partition theorems for expanded trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look for partition theorems for large subtrees for suitable uncountable trees and colourings. We concentrate on sub-trees of $^{\kappa \ge} 2$ expanded by a well ordering of each level. Unlike earlier works, we do not ask the embedding to preserve the height of the tree but the equality of levels is preserved. We get consistency results without large cardinals.
  The intention is to apply it to model theoretic problems.</description>

      <title>Relational Algebraic Approach to the Real Numbers: The Least-Upper-Bound Property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation of a real number object, i.e., an object representing the real numbers, in categories of relations. Our axiomatization is based on a relation algebraic version of Tarski's axioms of the real numbers. It was already shown that the addition of such an object forms a dense, linear ordered abelian group. In the current paper we will focus on the least-upper-bound property of such an object.</description>

Abstract: We show that the VC-density of any partitioned formula in a pair of ordered vector spaces is bounded above by twice the number of parameter variables.

      <title>On the global linear Zarankiewicz problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The `global' Zarankiewicz problem for hypergraphs asks for an upper bound on the number of edges of a finite $r$-hypergraph $V$ in terms of the number $|V|$ of its vertices, assuming the edge relation is induced by a fixed $K_{k, \dots, k}$-free $r$-hypergraph $E$, for some $k\in\mathbb N$. In [4], such bounds of size $O(|V|^{r-1})$ were achieved for a semilinear $E$, namely, definable in a linear o-minimal structure. We establish the same bounds in five new settings: when $E$ is definable in (a) a semibounded o-minimal structure and the vertex set of $V$ is `sufficiently distant', (b) a model of Presburger arithmetic, (c) the expansion $\langle\mathbb R,&lt;,+, \mathbb Z\rangle$ of the real ordered group by the set of integers, (d) a stable 1-based structure without the finite cover property, and (e) a locally modular regular type in a stable theory, such as the generic type of the solution set of the Heat differential equation.
  Our methods include techniques for reducing Zarankiewicz's problem to the setting of arbitrary subgroups of powers of groups, used in geometric cases (a)--(c). They also include an abstract version of Zarankiewicz's problem for general saturated `linear structures' that yields the desired bounds in the model-theoretic settings (d)--(e), as well as a parametric version in (b). Furthermore, the bounds in (a) characterise those o-minimal structures that do not recover a global field, and in (c) they yield new versions of Zarankiewicz's problem for certain ordered abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A logic of co-valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A co-valuation is, essentially, a minimal finite cover. We introduce a logic based on co-valuations, which play the role of valuations of free variables in classical first-order logic, and show that the fundamental tools of model theory -- such as ultraproducts, compactness, and omitting types -- can be developed in this setup. Using a recently discovered duality between certain countable posets and second-countable compact $T_1$ spaces, we show that these spaces are counterparts of countable universes in first-order logic. Thus, although no topology appears in the initial formulation, the logic of co-valuations turns out to be naturally suited for studying compact topological objects. Standard topological notions, such as connectedness and covering dimension, are easily expressible, and model-theoretic properties, such as atomicity, can be effectively analyzed. The framework also interacts well with Fra\"iss\'e-type constructions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25] and studies Goldstern's principle, a principle about unions of continuum many null sets, further. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Moreover, we show that this version holds provided that the measurable cardinal exists. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <title>MSO logic of the real order with the set quantifier ranging over Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated 1969 theorem of Michael Rabin is that the MSO theory of the real order where the monadic quantifier is allowed only to range over the sets of rational numbers, is decidable. In 1975 Saharon Shelah proved that if the monadic quantifier is allowed to range over all subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is undecidable. He conjectured that when we allow the monadic quantifier to range over the Borel subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is decidable. We confirm this conjecture. Namely, the MSO theory of the real order where the set quantifier is allowed to range over the Borel sets, is decidable.</description>

      <title>Di- is for Directed: First-Order Directed Type Theory via Dinaturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how dinaturality plays a central role in the interpretation of directed type theory where types are interpreted as (1-)categories and directed equality is represented by $\hom$-functors. We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-L\"of type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-L\"of type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>
