      <title>Representation of Typical Droplet Shapes in 2D Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the clustering of 5000 droplets, each originating from one of five distinct droplet classes, each representing a unique geometry. The shape coordinates of the droplets are mapped to a 2D latent space through a two-step, fully reversible process involving Fourier series and autoencoders. Thus, each droplet contour sampled by 400 points is represented by 2 scalar numbers. We present data mapping 5000 droplets in two-dimensional space, which reveals ringlike clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a distinct droplet class, with the classification based on the droplet morphology, which is known a priori. Further, we find that well-known clustering algorithms like DBSCAN show limited success in identifying these ring-shaped clusters underscoring the need to explore alternative clustering approaches, particularly those tailored to handle ring-shaped distributed data.</description>

      <title>An ensemble of Gaussian fields with multifractal statistics for turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate field statistics continues to be one of the major challenges in turbulence theory and modeling. From the various existing modeling approaches, multifractal models have been successful in capturing intermittency in velocity gradient and increment distributions. On the other hand, superstatistical models from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics have shown the capacity to model PDFs of various statistical turbulent quantities as ensembles of simpler stochastic processes. Here, we present an approach that generates field statistics in the form of a characteristic functional by promoting a model for multifractal increment statistics to an ensemble of Gaussian fields. By carefully designing the correlation function and the corresponding weight of each subensemble, we are able to define a functional that exhibits multifractal two-point inertial-range and dissipation-range statistics, and that blends into realistic large-scale behavior. Additionally, the method is capable of producing multifractal statistics with any of the widely used singularity spectra. We characterize the fidelity of our approach through comparisons to literature results from direct numerical simulations. Overall, our framework thereby bridges between three different perspectives to turbulence: superstatistics, multifractals, and functional approaches to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Correlation between One-Dimensional Periodically Oscillating Detonation Waves and Two-Dimensional Regular Cellular Detonation Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to establish a quantitative relationship between one-dimensional (1D) periodically oscillating detonation waves and two-dimensional (2D) regular cellular detonation waves. Numerical simulations were conducted for stoichiometric hydrogen-air detonation waves using the conservative Euler equations coupled with a single-step overall chemical reaction model. The evolution of both 1D periodically oscillating detonation waves and 2D regular cellular detonation waves was analyzed through flux-vector analysis. The results reveal that the period of forming a 2D detonation cell is equivalent to the period of the 1D periodically oscillating detonation wave. Furthermore, 2D regular cellular detonation waves exhibit two distinct time scales:(1) the collision period of triple-points, and (2) the ignition delay time of the heated gas behind the incident shock wave. These two time scales reach a balance for regular cellular detonation waves. The findings demonstrate that the ignition delay time is the key physical parameter for establishing a direct quantitative correlation between the two systems.</description>

      <title>Film-wise condensation of pure vapour in flattened tubes: A numerical study of the combined influence of aspect ratio and rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vapor condensation is a physical phenomenon that finds application in heat removal systems. The traditional design of these systems involves round tubes but experience shows that this geometry is not optimal for heat transfer. Flattened tubes on the other hand, have been found to offer potential for improvement as their geometry increases the condensation surface, which fosters higher heat transfer rates. However, the effects of tube shape (aspect ratio) and orientation (rotation angle) on film-wise condensation dynamics are not fully understood. In this work, we numerically simulate a model of the condensed vapor layer thickness distribution on the flattened tube inner surfaces taking into account bulk and surface forces (gravity, surface tension, shear stress) for a thin layer of liquid. We consider various configurations of aspect ratios (circular, and AR = 2, 4, and 6) and rotation angles (0{\deg}, 10{\deg}, 20{\deg}, 30{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 75{\deg}, and 90{\deg}). Our simulations allow for an improved understanding of how these geometric parameters as well as their interplay, influence the thickness distribution of the condensate film on the tube's inner surface, and facilitate the identification of configurations that maximize heat transfer efficiency. Considering water as a working fluid, results show a possible heat transfer enhancement of up to 74% compared to the round tube geometry for an aspect ratio of 6 and a rotation angle of 90{\deg}.</description>

      <title>Experiments on geostrophic convection: the role of the Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows at planetary scales are generally driven by buoyancy and influenced by rotation. Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRBC) is a practical and simple model that can be used to describe these systems. In RRBC, thermally induced convection occurs, which is influenced by the constant rotation it experiences. We study RRBC in a cylinder in the geostrophic regime, where the dominant force balance is between Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces. Experiments are performed to assess the dependence of the Nusselt number $Nu$ (efficiency of convective heat transfer) on the Prandtl number $Pr$ (ratio of kinematic viscosity over thermal diffusivity), a relation that is not explored much for geostrophic convection. By using water at different mean temperatures we can reach $2.8\le Pr\le 6$. We study the relation between $Pr$ and $Nu$ at constant Ekman number $Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ (an inverse measure for strength of rotation) for two different diameter-to-height aspect ratios ($\Gamma=1/5$ and $1/2$) of the setup. The corresponding constant Rayleigh numbers (strength of thermal forcing) are $Ra=1.1\times 10^{12}$ and $1\times 10^{11}$, respectively. Additionally, we measure the relation between the Rayleigh number $Ra$ and $Nu$ for $4\times10^{10}\le Ra\le 7\times10^{11}$, $Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ and $Pr=3.7$. It is found that $Nu$ exhibits a significant dependence on $Pr$, even within this limited range. Increasing $Pr$ by a factor 2 resulted in a decrease of $Nu$ of about $25 \%$. We hypothesize that the decrease of $Nu$ is caused by the changing ratio of the thermal and kinetic boundary layer thicknesses as a result of increasing $Pr$. We also consider the anticipated contributions of the wall mode to the heat transfer using sidewall temperature measurements.</description>

      <title>Pressure shifts in large-amplitude pulsatile shear flow: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>Radial Variations in Residence Time Distribution for Pipe Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of low-diffusing particles in pipe flows exhibit a difference in age at different radial positions. Particles near the channel walls have higher residence times than the cross-sectional average. We quantify this effect using Monte-Carlo simulations, and show the existence of two different regimes: a "transitional" regime where delay compounds with channel length, and a "far-field" regime where diffusion counterbalances advection. The results presented therein can be used to quantify residence time distributions near the walls of the tube. This effect is important to consider in experiments involving the kinetics of nanometer-scale particles using modern inline analytical tools. This work also provide a radially resolved extension of classical Taylor dispersion results.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb and McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth's QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to shear flow turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depending on the type of flow the transition to turbulence can take one of two forms, either turbulence arises from a sequence of instabilities, or from the spatial proliferation of transiently chaotic domains, a process analogous to directed percolation. The former scenario is commonly referred to as a supercritical transition and frequently encountered in flows destabilized by body forces, whereas the latter subcritical transition is common in shear flows. Both cases are inherently continuous in a sense that the transformation from ordered laminar to fully turbulent fluid motion is only accomplished gradually with flow speed. We here show that these established transition types do not account for the more general setting of shear flows subject to body forces. Counterintuitively the combination of the two continuous scenarios leads to the attenuation of spatial coupling and with forcing amplitude the transition becomes increasingly sharp and eventually discontinuous. We argue that the suppression of laminar-turbulent coexistence and the approach towards a discontinuous phase transition potentially apply to a broad range of situations including flows subject to e.g. buoyancy, centrifugal or electromagnetic forces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an internally actuated weakly elastic sphere translating parallel to a rigid wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of a weakly elastic spherical particle translating parallel to a rigid wall in a quiescent Newtonian fluid in the Stokes limit. The particle motion is constrained parallel to the wall by applying a point force and a point torque at the centre of its undeformed shape. The particle is modelled using the Navier elasticity equations. The series solutions to the Navier and the Stokes equations are utilised to obtain the displacement and velocity fields in the solid and fluid, respectively. The point force and the point torque are calculated as series in small parameters $\alpha$ and $1/H$, using the domain perturbation method and the method of reflections. Here, $\alpha$ is the measure of elastic strain induced in the particle resulting from the fluid's viscous stress, and $H$ is the non-dimensional gap width, defined as the ratio of the distance of the particle centre from the wall to its radius. The results are presented up to $\textit{O}(1/H^3)$ and $\textit{O}(1/H^2)$, assuming $\alpha \sim 1/H$, for cases where gravity is aligned and non-aligned with the particle velocity, respectively. The deformed shape of the particle is determined by the force distribution acting on it. The hydrodynamic lift due to elastic effects (acting away from the wall) appears at $\textit{O}(\alpha/H^2)$, in the former case. In an unbounded domain, the elastic effects in the latter case generate a hydrodynamic torque at \textit{O}($\alpha$) and a drag at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$). Conversely, in the former case, the torque is zero, while the drag still appears at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$).</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulations of conjugate heat transfer in boundary layers over laser-scanned ice roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of ice accretion is important for safe and efficient design of aircraft and wind turbine systems. Heat transfer predictions obtained from fluid flow solvers are used as input in ice accretion codes. In glaze ice conditions, freezing rates and resulting ice shapes are highly sensitive to input values of the heat transfer coefficient. Hence, accurate prediction of heat transfer on iced airfoils is crucial for correctly predicting the ice accretion process. In this study, we perform conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) over surfaces characterized by ice roughness. The results show that WMLES with CHT accurately captures surface temperature distributions and heat fluxes across a range of roughness geometries. For cases considered, large roughness-to-boundary-layer thickness ratios disrupt outer-layer similarity, leading to substantial errors in estimating equivalent sandgrain roughness when applying traditional empirical models based on surface statistics. The simulations further show that local heat fluxes vary significantly across roughness elements due to low thermal conductivity of the solid; in particular, roughness crests exhibit reduced fluxes in contrast to slopes and valleys. Notably, as roughness height increases, wall heat flux at the crest diminishes, even leading to heat flux reversal in some cases, where thermal energy is transferred from fluid to solid. These effects are not captured in isothermal wall simulations, which overestimate the Stanton number, especially at roughness peaks. By enabling calculation of Stanton number using heat flux distributions, not directly available in experiments, the present simulations augment experimental results and highlight the importance of including solid conduction effects for accurately modeling heat transfer over rough, low-conductivity surfaces such as ice.</description>

Abstract: Neither molecular kinetics nor continuum fluid dynamics alone is adequate to describe multiscale gas flows across different regimes. Bridging these regimes within a single self-consistent framework has long been a central challenge in fluid mechanics. We propose a unified gas kinetic framework that classifies molecules by their collision histories over an observation timescale. This formulation recovers the Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations as limiting cases, providing a transparent connection between kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. Beyond practical advantages for multiscale modeling, this framework offers a new perspective on Hilbert's sixth problem by linking microscopic dynamics to continuum mechanics through a tunable observational scale.</description>

      <title>A novel generalized inner product-based wave scattering from an underwater source in a compressible ocean</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to underwater explosions and volcanic eruptions, this paper considers the evolution of an initial pressure disturbance in the ocean, including effects due to the dynamic and static compression of water and the free surface. In order to solve the equations of motion of a linear compressible ocean, a special inner product is introduced, which allows us to apply self-adjoint operator theory. What results is a Hilbert space in which the acoustic-gravity modes are orthogonal in the generalised sense. This allows the time-domain evolution of the free surface and subsurface pressure field resulting from an initial disturbance to be calculated. Our simulations show initial radial propagation of the pressure pulse and subsequent reflection from the water surface and the rigid ocean floor, eventually leading to horizontal propagation away from the source point. The solutions with and without the inclusion of the static compression are compared, and the effect of static compression is shown to be small but not negligible.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic AI Framework with Explicit Time Integration for Long-Term Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems - governed by partial differential equations - present unique challenges regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels. As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. We demonstrate significant gains in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better scaling to more complex dynamics.

      <title>A General Model for Static Contact Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.</description>
