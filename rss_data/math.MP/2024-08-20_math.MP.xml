      <title>A Kac-Weyl Character Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit quantization of Chern-Simons theory leads to an identity between sums of the Kac-Weyl characters. One can use this identity to prove inequalities that constrain the fusion coefficients $N_{\mu\nu}^l$ in the case of RCFTs that descend from current algebras. It also leads to a statement regarding the conjugacy symmetry of the sums of squares of fusion coefficients for current algebras admitting complex representations.</description>

      <title>Matrix structure of classical ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded algebra $\mathfrak g$ with a bracket $[|. , . |]$ that satisfies certain graded versions of the symmetry and Jacobi identity. In particular, despite the common terminology, $\mathfrak g$ is not a Lie algebra. We construct classes of ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebras corresponding to the classical Lie algebras, in terms of their defining matrices. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $A$, the construction coincides with the previously known class. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $B$, $C$ and $D$ our construction is new and gives rise to interesting defining matrices closely related to the classical ones but undoubtedly different. We also give some examples and possible applications to parastatistics.</description>

      <title>Infinite Bifurcations in Thomas system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are going to make an analytical and numerical analysis for the Thomas system.
  Physically, this system describes a particle, driving by a system of oscillators, dissipated by a dissipation term b &gt; 0. Mathematically, this system is very interesting because it contains rich dynamics in it which is generated by only one bifurcation parameter b. Depending on the value of b, the system is undergo through a stable regime, limit cycles, infinite amount of bifurcations, a series growing to infinity of fixed points, and chaos containing multiple attractors. Another interesting behaviour of the system is in the limit of b goes to zero, which means that there is no dissipation term. The system is then containing an infinite number of fixed points and behaves like a Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional quantum central limit theorem by quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks, mathematical models referred to as the quantum counterparts of random walks, have garnered significant attention in recent years with the advancement of quantum computing. The weak limit theorem for quantum walks, analogous to the central limit theorem for random walks, is one of the most important theorems in this field. In this study, we investigated the weak limit theorem for a two-state discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional square lattice. As a result, we derived a two-dimensional probability distribution whose support is the intersection of two ellipses. The probability distribution we obtained resembles the distribution of one-dimensional quantum walks while possessing a unique form specific to two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion of the Eigenvalues of a Bathtub Potential with Quadratic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of a one-dimensional semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator, where the potential consist of two quadratic ends (that is, looks like a harmonic oscillator at each infinite end), possibly with a flat region in the middle. Such a potential notably has a discontinuity in the second derivative. We derive an asymptotic expansion, valid either in the high energy regime or the semiclassical regime, with a leading order term given by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, and an asymptotic expansion consisting of negative powers of the leading order term, with coefficients that are oscillatory in the leading order term. We apply this expansion to study the results of the Gutzwiller Trace formula and the heat kernel asymptotic for this class of potentials, giving an idea into what results to expect for such trace formulas for non-smooth potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study isometries of quantum Wasserstein distances and divergences on the quantum bit state space. We describe isometries with respect to the symmetric quantum Wasserstein divergence $d_{sym}$, the divergence induced by all of the Pauli matrices. We also give a complete characterization of isometries with respect to $D_z$, the quantum Wasserstein distance corresponding to the single Pauli matrix $\sigma_z$.</description>

      <title>Shape Evolution of Fluid Deformable Surfaces under Active Geometric Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for fluid deformable surfaces provide valid theories to describe the dynamics of thin fluidic sheets of soft materials. To use such models in morphogenesis and development requires to incorporate active forces. We consider active geometric forces which respond to mean curvature gradients. Due to these forces perturbations in shape can induce tangential flows which can enhance the perturbation leading to shape instabilities. We numerically explore these shape instabilities and analyse the resulting dynamics of closed surfaces with constant enclosed volume. The numerical approach considers surface finite elements and a semi-implicit time stepping scheme and shows optimal convergence properties, which have been proven for Stokes flow on stationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Comparing two different types of stochastic parametrisation in geophysical flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of stochastic variations in bathymetry on the solutions of the thermal quasigeostrophic (TQG) equations. These stochastic perturbations generate a variety of different types of ensemble spread in the solution behaviour whilst also preserving the deterministic Lie Poisson structure and Casimir conservation laws. We numerically compare the solution sensitivity, to another type of structure-preserving stochastic perturbation where instead of bathymetry, the velocity is stochastically perturbed.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport on null hypersurfaces and the null energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of the present work is to study optimal transport on null hypersurfaces inside Lorentzian manifolds. The challenge here is that optimal transport along a null hypersurface is completely degenerate, as the cost takes only the two values $0$ and $+\infty$.
  The tools developed in the manuscript enable to give an optimal transport characterization of the null energy condition (namely, non-negative Ricci curvature in the null directions) for Lorentzian manifolds in terms of convexity properties of the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy along null-geodesics of probability measures.
  We obtain as applications: a stability result under convergence of spacetimes, a comparison result for null-cones, and the Hawking area theorem (both in sharp form, for possibly weighted measures, and with apparently new rigidity statements).</description>

      <title>Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar domain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length spectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular support of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\pm$ the length spectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct large families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard orbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the microlocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in our previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary curvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such periodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible wave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in using the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that the Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical objects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.</description>

      <title>Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains undergoing boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system, described by a dissipation-projected Hamiltonian of the original system. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of $XXX$ and $XXZ$ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the nonequilibrium steady state spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. This leads, in particular, to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression in the NESS spectrum of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</description>

Abstract: The Landau-Nordita conference that was held in Moscow in 1981 was the first place where I met Lars. This "marvellous meeting", as Lars quoted in one of his reminiscence article, was organised by Alan Luther. It was an event that generated a long-lasting friendship of scientists from East and West, provided a background for the future collaborations and, in particular, my own collaboration with Lars on a supersymmetric high-spin extension of the Poincar\'e group.</description>

      <title>The modified Toda hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, modified Toda (mToda) equation is generalized to form an integrable hierarchy in the framework of Sato theory, which is therefore called mToda hierarchy. Inspired by the fact that Toda hierarchy is 2--component generalization of usual KP hierarchy, mToda hierarchy is constructed from bilinear equations of 2--component 1st modified KP hierarchy, where we provide the corresponding equivalence with Lax formulations. Then it is demonstrated that there are Miura links between Toda and mToda hierarchies, which means the definition of mToda hierarchy here is reasonable. Finally, Darboux transformations of the Toda and mToda hierarchies are also constructed by using the aforementioned Miura links.</description>

      <title>Toda Darboux transformations and vacuum expectation values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinant formulas for vacuum expectation values $\langle s+k+n-m,-s|e^{H(\mathbf{t})}\beta_m^{*}\cdots\beta_1^{*}\beta_n\cdots\beta_1g|k\rangle $ are given by using Toda Darboux transformations. Firstly notice that 2--Toda hierarchy can be viewed as the 2--component bosonizations of fermionic KP hierarchy, then two elementary Toda Darboux transformation operators $T_{+}(q)=\Lambda(q)\cdot\Delta\cdot q^{-1}$ and $T_{-}(r)=\Lambda^{-1}(r)^{-1}\cdot\Delta^{-1}\cdot r$ are constructed from the changes of Toda (adjoint) wave functions by using 2--component boson--fermion correspondence. Based on this, the above vacuum expectation values now can be realized as the successive applications of Toda Darboux transformations. So the corresponding determinant formulas can be derived from the determinant representations of Toda Darboux transformations. Finally by similar methods, we also give the determinant formulas for $\langle n-m|e^{\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x})}\beta_m^{*}\cdots\beta_1^{*}\beta_n\cdots\beta_1g|k\rangle $ related with KP tau functions.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Hermitian Yang-Mills Instantons on Coset Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In four dimensions, 't Hooft symbols offer a compact and powerful framework for describing the self-dual structures fundamental to instanton physics. Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin Bases for Elliptic Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the level-0 representations of the elliptic quantum group $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We give a classification theorem of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ in terms of the theta function analogue of the Drinfeld polynomial for the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We also construct the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for the level-0 $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$-modules following the work by Nazarov-Tarasov for the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_N)$-modules. This is a construction in terms of the Drinfeld generators. For the case of tensor product of the vector representations, we give another construction of the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases in terms of the $L$-operators and make a connection between the two constructions. We also compare them with those obtained by the first author by using the $\mathfrak{S}_n$-action realized by the elliptic dynamical $R$-matrix on the standard bases. As a byproduct, we obtain an explicit formula for the partition functions of the corresponding 2-dimensional square lattice model in terms of the elliptic weight functions of type $A_{N-1}$.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Sigma Models and Yang-Baxter Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter deformation with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct a multi-parameter family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. We show that every model in this family is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for its equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of solutions to Tolman-Openheimer-Volkoff equation with linear equation of state modeling relativistic cloud of interacting particles is proved for mass parameter below certain threshold. For the intermediate values of mass parameters multiplicity result holds. For the small mass parameter the uniqueness is guaranteed. Moreover, there is a threshold value of the mass, which can not be exceeded. It is achieved by considering the related dynamical system in the rescaled mass-density variables which is governed by the global Lyapunov function with sink. Some preliminary extensions to nonlinear equation of state are discussed with numerical density profiles.</description>

      <title>Holographic M-Brane Super-Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature.
  Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embedding of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds. The result seems to be novel and shows that the holographic M-probes, static with respect to the Poincar\'e chart, must sit exactly at the throat radius.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Generalised Skew-Symmetric Replicator Equations via Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a one-to-one mapping between oriented directed graphs and zero-sum replicator dynamics (Lotka-Volterra equations) and that furthermore these dynamics are Hamiltonian in an appropriately defined nonlinear Poisson bracket. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether these dynamics are Liouville-Arnold integrable, building on prior work graph in graph decloning by Evripidou et al. [J. Phys. A., 55:325201, 2022] and graph embedding by Paik and Griffin [Phys. Rev. E. 107(5): L052202, 2024]. Using the embedding procedure from Paik and Griffin, we show (with certain caveats) that when a graph producing integrable dynamics is embedded in another graph producing integrable dynamics, the resulting graph structure also produces integrable dynamics. We also construct a new family of graph structures that produces integrable dynamics that does not arise either from embeddings or decloning. We use these results to classify the dynamics generated by almost all oriented directed graphs on six vertices, with three hold-out graphs that generate integrable dynamics and are not part of a natural taxonomy arising from known families and graph operations. These hold-out graphs suggest more structure is available to be found. Moreover, the work suggests that oriented directed graphs leading to integrable dynamics may be classifiable in an analogous way to the classification of finite simple groups, creating the possibility that there is a deep connection between integrable dynamics and combinatorial structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the eddy diffusivity in a pollutant dispersion model in the planetary boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, eddy diffusivity is derived from the energy spectra for the stable and convective regimes in the planetary boundary layer. The energy spectra are obtained from a spectral model for the inertial subrange that considers the anomalous behavior of turbulence. This spectrum is expressed as a function of the Hausdorff fractal dimension. The diffusivity eddies are employed in a classical Eulerian dispersion model, where the derivatives are of integer order and in fractional dispersion model, where the derivatives are of fractional order. The eddy diffusivity proposed considers the anomalous nature of geophysical turbulent flow. The results obtained with the fractional and classic dispersion models using the eddy diffusivity proposed is satisfactory when compared with the experimental data of the Prairie Grass and Hanford experiments in a stable regime, and the Copenhagen experiment in a convective regime.</description>

      <title>On particular integrability for (co)symplectic and (co)contact Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization and extension of our previous paper [Escobar-Ruiz and Azuaje, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 105202 (2024)], in this work, the notions of particular integral and particular integrability in classical mechanics are extended to the formalisms of cosymplectic, contact and cocontact geometries. This represents a natural scheme to study nonintegrable time-dependent systems where only a part of the whole dynamics satisfies the conditions for integrability. Specifically, for Hamiltonian systems on cosymplectic, contact and cocontact manifolds, it is demonstrated that the existence of a particular integral allows us to f ind certain integral curves from a reduced, lower dimensional, set of Hamilton equations. In the case of particular integrability, these trajectories can be obtained by quadratures. Notably, for dissipative systems described by contact geometry, a particular integral can be viewed as a generalization of the important concept of dissipated quantity as well.</description>

Abstract: We provide an analytic method for estimating the entanglement of the non-gaussian energy eigenstates of disordered harmonic oscillator systems. We invoke the explicit formulas of the eigenstates of the oscillator systems to establish bounds for their $\epsilon$-R\'enyi entanglement entropy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Our methods result in a logarithmically corrected area law for the entanglement of eigenstates, corresponding to one excitation, of the disordered harmonic oscillator systems.</description>

Abstract: We give a rigorous derivation of the free energy of (i) the classical Ising model on the triangular lattice with translation-invariant coupling constants, and (ii) the one-dimensional quantum Ising model. We use the method of Kac and Ward. The novel aspect is that the coupling constants may have negative signs. We describe the logarithmic singularity of the specific heat of the classical model and the validity of the Cimasoni--Duminil-Copin--Li formula for the critical temperature. We also discuss the quantum phase transition of the quantum model.</description>

      <title>A theory for the zeros of Riemann $\zeta$ and other $L$-functions (updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1407.4358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures we first review the important properties of the Riemann $\zeta$-function that are necessary to understand the nature and importance of the Riemann hypothesis (RH). In particular this first part describes the analytic continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler product formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip to the distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of zeros on the strip $N(T)$, and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical line. We then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and describe several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an electrostatic analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line $\Re (z) =1$ is a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main new result is that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one correspondence with the zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a transcendental equation for the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends only on $n$. If there is a unique solution to this equation for every $n$, denoting $N_0 (T)$ the number of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) = N(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the critical line. These results are generalized to two infinite classes of functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions based on modular forms. We present extensive numerical analysis of the solutions of these equations. We apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn $L$-function, which is known to have zeros off of the line, and explain why the RH fails in this case. We also present a new approximation to the $\zeta$-function that is analogous to the Stirling approximation to the $\Gamma$-function.
  In this updated version we added references to subsequent publications that made progress on open questions posed in the previous version from 10 years ago.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of BPS Moduli Spaces and Asymptotics of Supersymmetric Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a prototype for Wilsonian analysis of asymptotics of supersymmetric partition functions of non-abelian gauge theories. Localization allows expressing such partition functions as an integral over a BPS moduli space. When the limit of interest introduces a scale hierarchy in the problem, asymptotics of the partition function is obtained in the Wilsonian approach by $i)$ decomposing (in some suitable scheme) the BPS moduli space into various patches according to the set of light fields (lighter than the scheme dependent cut-off $\Lambda$) they support, $ii)$ localizing the partition function of the effective field theory on each patch (with cut-offs set by the scheme), and $iii)$ summing up the contributions of all patches to obtain the final asymptotic result (which is scheme-independent and accurate as $\Lambda\to\infty$). Our prototype concerns the Cardy-like asymptotics of the 4d superconformal index, which has been of interest recently for its application to black hole microstate counting in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain the most general asymptotic expression for the index of gauge theories in the Cardy-like limit, encompassing and extending all previous results.</description>

      <title>Zero-Temperature Chaos in Bidimensional Models with Finite-Range Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a finite-range potential on a bidimensional full shift on a finite alphabet that exhibits a zero-temperature chaotic behavior as introduced by van Enter and Ruszel. This is the phenomenon where there exists a sequence of temperatures that converges to zero for which the whole set of equilibrium measures at these given temperatures oscillates between two sets of ground states. Br\'emont's work shows that the phenomenon of non-convergence does not exist for finite-range potentials in dimension one for finite alphabets; Leplaideur obtained a different proof for the same fact. Chazottes and Hochman provided the first example of non-convergence in higher dimensions $d\geq3$; we extend their result for $d=2$ and highlight the importance of two estimates of recursive nature that are crucial for this proof: the relative complexity and the reconstruction function of an extension.
  We note that a different proof of this result was found by Chazottes and Shinoda, at around the same time that this article was initially submitted and that a strong generalization has been found by Gayral, Sablik and Taati.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the polynuclear growth model is a completely integrable Markov process in the sense that its transition probabilities are given by Fredholm determinants of kernels produced by a scattering transform based on the invariant measures modulo the absolute height, continuous time simple random walks. From the linear evolution of the kernels, it is shown that the $n$-point distributions are determinants of $n\times n$ matrices evolving according to the two dimensional non-Abelian Toda lattice.</description>

Abstract: We compute the precise logarithmic corrections to Alexander-Orbach behaviour for various quantities describing the geometric and spectral properties of the four-dimensional uniform spanning tree. In particular, we prove that the volume of an intrinsic $n$-ball in the tree is $n^2 (\log n)^{-1/3+o(1)}$, that the typical intrinsic displacement of an $n$-step random walk is $n^{1/3} (\log n)^{1/9-o(1)}$, and that the $n$-step return probability of the walk decays as $n^{-2/3}(\log n)^{1/9-o(1)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every regular graph, we define a sequence of integers, using the recursion of the Martin polynomial. This sequence counts spanning tree partitions and constitutes the diagonal coefficients of powers of the Kirchhoff polynomial. We prove that this sequence respects all known symmetries of Feynman period integrals in quantum field theory. We show that other quantities with this property, the $c_2$ invariant and the extended graph permanent, are essentially determined by our new sequence. This proves the completion conjecture for the $c_2$ invariant at all primes, and also that it is fixed under twists. We conjecture that our invariant is perfect: Two Feynman periods are equal, if and only if, their Martin sequences are equal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos and Coherence: Random Parametric Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The survival probability of an initial Coherent Gibbs State (CGS) is a natural extension of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) to open quantum systems. To quantify the interplay between quantum chaos and decoherence away from the semi-classical limit, we investigate the relation of this generalized SFF with the corresponding $l_1$-norm of coherence. As a working example, we introduce Parametric Quantum Channels (PQC), a discrete-time model of unitary evolution mixed with the effects of measurements or transient interactions with an environment. The Energy Dephasing (ED) dynamics arises as a specific case in the Markovian limit. We demonstrate our results in a series of random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Leapfrogging vortex rings as scaling limit of Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an incompressible fluid with axial symmetry without swirl, assuming initial data such that the initial vorticity is very concentrated inside $N$ small disjoint rings of thickness $\varepsilon$, each one of vorticity mass and main radius of order $|\log\varepsilon|$. When $\varepsilon \to 0$, we show that, at least for small but positive times, the motion of the rings converges to a dynamical system firstly introduced in [NoDEA Nonlinear Diff. Eq. Appl. 6 (1999), 473-499]. In the special case of two vortex rings with large enough main radius, the result is improved reaching longer times, in such a way to cover the case of several overtakings between the rings, thus providing a mathematical rigorous derivation of the leapfrogging phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Double or nothing: a Kolmogorov extension theorem for multitime (bi)probabilities in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multitime probability distributions obtained by repeatedly probing a quantum system via the measurement of an observable generally violate Kolmogorov's consistency property. Therefore, one cannot interpret such distributions as the result of the sampling of a single trajectory. We show that, nonetheless, they do result from the sampling of one pair of trajectories. In this sense, rather than give up on trajectories, quantum mechanics requires to double down on them. To this purpose, we prove a generalization of the Kolmogorov extension theorem that applies to families of complex-valued bi-probability distributions (that is, defined on pairs of elements of the original sample spaces), and we employ this result in the quantum mechanical scenario. We also discuss the relation of our results with the quantum comb formalism.</description>

      <title>$(2,2p+1)$ minimal string and intersection theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto equation from three-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of the commutative graph complex and the top weight cohomology of $\mathcal M_g$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distribution of open Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes on an Interval as a marginal of a two-layer ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on an interval with open boundaries. We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for the two-layer weight function.</description>
