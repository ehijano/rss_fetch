      <title>The bulk-edge correspondence for curved interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-edge correspondence is a condensed matter theorem that relates the conductance of a Hall insulator in a half-plane to that of its (straight) boundary. In this work, we extend this result to domains with curved boundaries.
  Under mild geometric assumptions, we prove that the edge conductance of a topological insulator sample is an integer multiple of its Hall conductance. This integer counts the algebraic number of times that the interface (suitably oriented) enters the measurement set. This result provides a rigorous proof of a well-known experimental observation: arbitrarily truncated topological insulators support edge currents, regardless of the shape of their boundary.</description>

      <title>Acronal Localization, Representations of the Causal Logic for massive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On plain physical grounds localization of relativistic quantum particles is extended to the acronal regions of Minkowski spacetime. Acronal localization fulfills automatically the requirements of causality. It constitutes the frame which complies most completely with the principle of causality for quantum mechanical systems. Acronal localization is equivalent to the localization in the regions of the causal logic. Representations of the causal logic are constructed for the systems with mass spectrum of positive Lebesgue measure and every definite spin. Apparently no representation of the causal logic for a real mass system has been achieved in the past.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the non-linear supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-linear supersymmetric hyperbolic sigma models with long-range interactions on boxes in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and on a hierarchical lattice. We prove that the random field associated to a marginal in horospherical coordinates has asymptotically arbitrarily small fluctuations for large enough interactions, uniformly in the size of the boxes. This can be viewed as a strong version of spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz boost symmetry.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Representation-theoretical characterization of canonical custodial symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider graphs derived from aperiodically ordered tilings of the plane, by treating each corner of each tile as a vertex and each side of each tile as an edge. We calculate the average degree of these graphs. For the Ammann A2 tiling, we present a closed-form formula for the average degree. For the Kite and Dart Penrose tiling, the Rhomb Penrose Tiling, and the Ammann-Beenker tiling we present numerical calculations for the average degree.</description>

Abstract: Consider two balls with radius $r&gt;0$ whose centers are at a distance $2$, positioned symmetrically with respect to the origin in ${\mathbb{R}}^d$. Suppose that the initial velocities are independent standard normal vectors. When $r\to0$, the collision probability goes to 0 as $r^{d-1}$, and the asymptotic collision location distribution is a (defective) $t$-distribution. This distribution is rotationally symmetric about the origin for no apparent reason.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Optimal-speed unitary time evolution of pure and quasi-pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a characterization of the Hamiltonians that generate optimal-speed unitary time evolution and the associated dynamical trajectory, where the initial states are either pure states or quasi-pure quantum states. We construct the manifold of pure states as an orbit under the conjugation action of the Lie group $\SU(n)$ on the manifold of one-dimensional orthogonal projectors, obtaining an isometry with the flag manifold $\SU(n)/\textnormal{S}(\textnormal{U}(1)\times \textnormal{U}(n-1 ))$. From this construction, we show that Hamiltonians generating optimal-speed time evolution are fully characterized by equigeodesic vectors of $\SU(n)/\textnormal{S}(\textnormal{U}(1)\times \textnormal{U}(n-1))$. We later extend that result to quasi-pure quantum states.</description>

      <title>Time correlations in the inverse-gamma polymer with flat initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in the KPZ universality class have gained significant attention, following the conjectures in [Ferr-Spoh'16]. Building on prior work in the zero temperature setting [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], we address the time correlation problem with flat initial conditions in the positive temperature regime. Our study focuses on the inverse-gamma polymer, where we establish an upper bound for the correlation between two free energies whose endpoints are far apart in time. In contrast to the previous work [Basu-Gang-Zhan'21], our work not only extends the result to positive temperatures but also eliminates the reliance on integrable probability inputs related to the Airy process. This advancement allows us to address local scales, where the short time remains fixed while the large time grows arbitrarily, a scenario beyond the reach of the Airy scaling limit.</description>

      <title>A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model for the learning with errors problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a crucial computational challenge with significant implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model (HAWI) to address the LWE problem. Our approach involves transforming the LWE problem into the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. We then identify the low-energy levels of the Hamiltonian to extract the solution, making it suitable for implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We prove that the number of qubits required is less than $m(3m-1)/2$, where $m$ is the number of samples in the algorithm. Our algorithm is heuristic, and its time complexity depends on the specific quantum algorithm employed to find the Hamiltonian's low-energy levels. If the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is used to solve the Ising Hamiltonian problem, and the number of iterations satisfies $y &lt; O\left(m\log m\cdot 2^{0.2972k}/pk^2\right)$, our algorithm will outperform the classical Block Korkine-Zolotarev (BKZ) algorithm, where $k$ is the block size related to problem parameters, and $p$ is the number of layers in QAOA. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a real quantum device with $5$ qubits, showing its potential for solving meaningful instances of the LWE problem in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence associated with the $q$-difference sixth Painlev\'e equation in the crystal limit, i.e. $q\rightarrow 0$, and show two main results. First, the limit of this generically highly transcendental mapping is shown to exist. Second, we show that the limiting map is bi-rational and describe it explicitly.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for resonant states near a bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states near a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix is subject to a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of cylinders on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.</description>

      <title>Response of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference is often determined using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, it is usually difficult to identify the constitutive relation of the associated stress-free reference, without performing a destructive testing. In this paper, we introduce three approaches to determine the response of the stress-free, or any arbitrary initially stressed reference, using the response of a given initially stressed reference. The first and third approaches directly find out the constitutive relations for one stressed reference from another. The second approach uses the response of a given stressed reference, to identify the stress-free material, and thereafter determines the response of any stressed reference. Quite interestingly, it appears that the stress-free material, or the arbitrarily stressed references, can be implicit, although the given (known) initially stressed state is Green elastic. We also obtain a few simple cases of explicit constitutive relations. These approaches of changing the reference configuration do not begin from the stress-free state. Using the present framework and the concept of symmetry, we also explore the dependence or independence of constitutive relation on the choice of reference. The present work also develops the universal relations for stress-free isotropic implicit elastic materials.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for {\it quantum} A-polynomials of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple geometric way is suggested to derive the Ward identities in the Chern-Simons theory, also known as quantum $A$- and $C$-polynomials for knots. In quasi-classical limit it is closely related to the well publicized augmentation theory and contact geometry. Quantization allows to present it in much simpler terms, what could make these techniques available to a broader audience. To avoid overloading of the presentation, only the case of the colored Jones polynomial for the trefoil knot is considered, though various generalizations are straightforward. Restriction to solely Jones polynomials (rather than full HOMFLY-PT) is related to a serious simplification, provided by the use of Kauffman calculus. Going beyond looks realistic, however it remains a problem, both challenging and promising.</description>

      <title>A modern approach to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on circular vortex sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We represent the outermost shear interface of an eddy by a circular vortex sheet in two dimensions, and provide a new proof of linear instability via the Birkhoff-Rott equation. Like planar vortex sheets, circular sheets are found to be susceptible to a violent short-wave instability known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, with some modifications due to vortex sheet geometry. This result is in agreement with the classical derivation of (Moore 1974, Saffman 1992), but our modern approach provides greater clarity. We go on to show that the linear evolution problem can develop a singularity from analytic initial data in a time proportional to the square of the vortex sheet radius. Numerical evidence is presented that suggests this linear instability captures the wave-breaking mechanism observed in nonlinear point vortex simulations. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can contribute to the development of secondary instability for eddies in two-dimensional turbulent flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) are standard examples of generalized symmetries in quantum field theory. Integrable lattice incarnations of these TDLs, such as those provided by spin/anyonic chains, provide a crucial playground to investigate their properties, both analytically and numerically. Here, a family of parameter-dependent integrable lattice models is presented, which realize different TDLs in a given CFT as the parameter is varied. These models are based on the general quantum-inverse scattering construction, and involve inhomogeneities of the spectral parameter. Both defect hamiltonians and (defect) line operators are obtained in closed form. By varying the inhomogeneities, renormalization group flows between different TDLs (such as the Verlinde lines associated with the Virasoro primaries $(1,s)$ and $(s,1)$ in diagonal minimal CFTs) are then studied using different aspects of the Bethe-ansatz as well as ab-initio numerical techniques. Relationships with the anisotropic Kondo model as well as its non-Hermitian version are briefly discussed</description>

      <title>Weak gauge PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise AKSZ sigma models to the case of general local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE where the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among such objects one can find a minimal one which is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arise from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle BV formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs which correspond to local theories.</description>

      <title>Aliasing and Label-Independent Decomposition of Risk: Beyond the bias-variance trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict function values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. We introduce an alternative paradigm called the generalized aliasing decomposition. We explain the asymptotically small error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in the over-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the contribution due to aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error we call the invertibility failure of very large models on few training points. Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate this approach using several examples, including classical regression problems and a cluster expansion model used in materials science.</description>

      <title>Exact Hydrodynamic Manifolds for the Linear Boltzmann BGK Equation I: Spectral Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a complete spectral analysis of the linear three-dimensional Boltzmann BGK operator resulting in an explicit transcendental equation for the eigenvalues. Using the theory of finite-rank perturbations, we confirm the existence of a critical wave number $k_{\rm crit}$ which limits the number of hydrodynamic modes in the frequency space. This implies that there are only finitely many isolated eigenvalues above the essential spectrum at each wave number, thus showing the existence of a finite-dimensional, well-separated linear hydrodynamic manifold as a combination of invariant eigenspaces. The obtained results can serve as a benchmark for validating approximate theories of hydrodynamic closures and moment methods and provides the basis for the spectral closure operator.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Localization for the Singular Anderson Model in $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that once one has the ingredients of a ``single-energy multiscale analysis (MSA) result'' on the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ lattice, several spectral and dynamical localization results can be derived, the most prominent being strong dynamical localization (SDL). In particular, given the recent progress at the bottom of the spectrum for the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$ cases with Bernoulli single site probability distribution, our results imply SDL in these regimes.</description>

      <title>Contact geometric mechanics: the Tulczyjew triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the classical Tulczyjew triple as a geometric tool in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms which serves for contact manifolds. The r\^ole of the canonical symplectic structures on cotangent bundles in Tulczyjew's case is played by the canonical contact structures on the bundles $J^1L$ of first jets of sections of line bundles $L\to M$. Contact Hamiltonians and contact Lagrangians are understood as sections of certain line bundles, and they determine (generally implicit) dynamics on the contact phase space $J^1L$. We also study a contact analog of the Legendre map and the Legendre transformation of generating objects in both contact formalisms. Several explicit examples are offered.</description>

      <title>The Baker-Coon-Romans $N$-point amplitude and an exact field theory limit of the Coon amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N$-point Coon amplitude discovered first by Baker and Coon in the 1970s and then again independently by Romans in the 1980s. This Baker-Coon-Romans (BCR) amplitude retains several properties of tree-level string amplitudes, namely duality and factorization, with a $q$-deformed version of the string spectrum. Although the formula for the $N$-point BCR amplitude is only valid for ${q &gt; 1}$, the four-point case admits a straightforward extension to all ${q \geq 0}$ which reproduces the usual expression for the four-point Coon amplitude. At five points, there are inconsistencies with factorization when pushing ${q &lt; 1}$. Despite these issues, we find a new relation between the five-point BCR amplitude and Cheung and Remmen's four-point basic hypergeometric amplitude, placing the latter within the broader family of Coon amplitudes. Finally, we compute the $q \to \infty$ limit of the $N$-point BCR amplitudes and discover an exact correspondence between these amplitudes and the field theory amplitudes of a scalar transforming in the adjoint representation of a global symmetry group with an infinite set of non-derivative single-trace interaction terms. This correspondence at $q = \infty$ is the first definitive realization of the Coon amplitude (in any limit) from a field theory described by an explicit Lagrangian.</description>
