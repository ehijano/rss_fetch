      <title>Robust flat bands of the honeycomb wire network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that periodic honeycomb networks of ballistic conducting channels generically host exact flat bands spanning the entire Brillouin zone. These flat bands are independent of microscopic vertex scattering, persist for any number of transverse modes, and occur in a universal $1\colon 2$ ratio with dispersive bands. Their existence is enforced by local $D_3$ vertex symmetry and lattice translations. We construct compact localized states obeying a Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition and demonstrate that flat bands survive in realistic antidot lattices, establishing honeycomb wire networks as a robust flat band platform relevant to gated high-mobility 2D electron gases and molecule-patterned metallic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Highly-Indistinguishable Single-Photons at 1550 nm from a Two-photon Resonantly Excited Purcell-enhanced Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal scattering and generalized unitarity in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Einstein-de Haas Effect Induced by Chiral Phonons in Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.</description>

      <title>Wavefront-Dislocation Evolution via Quadratic Band Touching Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront dislocations (WDs) -- phase singularities observed in quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments -- have been widely interpreted as the definitive real-space signatures of Berry phases in graphene-family systems. Here, we disentangle the roles of topological charge and pseudospin texture in WD experiments. By investigating various way of the annihilation of quadratic band touchings (QBTs) in bilayer graphene and magneto-spin-orbit graphene systems, we demonstrate that WD evolution is governed exclusively by changes in the underlying pseudospin winding, while remaining insensitive to the topological charge (i.e., vorticity) of the band touching itself. Our results imply that WD measures wavefunction pseudospin texture rather than a diagnostic of topological charge and provide solid-state platforms in which WD evolution can be engineered and observed.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in an optomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in a cavity optomechanical system utilizing a partly resolved sideband regime. Optomechanical coupling provides a delayed nonlinear backaction to the mechanical modes, resulting in nonlinear mechanical damping. This optically induced nonlinear damping is observed in the frequency and time domains, and we show using both theory and experiment that it can be tuned via laser detuning. We also observe optically mediated cross-nonlinear damping between two mechanical modes: the amplitude of one mode modulates the damping of the other. The presented results show a fully tunable scheme of nonlinear mechanical damping that will be applicable to various non-trivial systems, governed by nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing valley quantum oscillations via the spin Seebeck effect in transition metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnet hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-valley-locked tunneling transport in a transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field, driven by the spin Seebeck effect. We demonstrate that spin-valley coupling together with the magnetic-field-induced valley-asymmetric Landau-level structure enables the generation of a valley-polarized spin current from valley-selective spin excitation. We compare the spin current and the valley-polarized spin current in the conduction and valence bands and clarify their distinct microscopic origins. We predict pronounced quantum oscillations of the valley-polarized spin current, providing a clear experimental signature of quantized valley states.</description>

      <title>Chirality Driven Ratchet Currents in Two-Dimensional Tellurene with an Asymmetric Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the terahertz (THz) ratchet effect is a rapidly expanding field of research that utilizes broken spatial symmetry in low-dimensional materials to rectify alternating current (AC) induced by THz fields into direct current (DC). This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.</description>

      <title>Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</description>

      <title>Direct laser writing of high aspect ratio nanochannels for nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanochannels with high width-to-height aspect ratios are desirable for many applications, particularly those requiring optical access, but remain challenging to fabricate. In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Spin splitting, Kondo correlation and singlet-doublet quantum phase transition in a superconductor-coupled InSb nanosheet quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, offering theoretical insights for the experimental manipulation of bound states.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the N\'eel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lam\'{e} coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</description>

      <title>Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable for characterizing MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.</description>

      <title>Gating upconversion electroluminescence in a single molecule via adsorption-induced interaction of unpaired spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules with unpaired spins (radicals) offer promising alternatives to closed-shell molecules as they are less limited regarding the spin statistics in their electroluminescence. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence and density functional theory to study single vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules, which are stable neutral radicals. Two distinct adsorption geometries of the molecule on NaCl/Au(111) lead to a difference in the interaction of the unpaired electron with the substrate, which in turn allows us to investigate its effects on the light emission process. Remarkably, we observe that up-conversion electroluminescence is gated by the adsorption geometry of the molecule, an effect we attribute to a reordering of excited states and enhanced excited state transition probabilities. The profound influence of the unpaired electron via state reordering opens new possibilities for tuning not only molecular electroluminescence but also many other spin dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1\text{g}}$ Raman Mode in MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When combined into van der Waals heterostructures, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers enable the exploration of novel physics beyond their unique individual properties. However, for interesting phenomena such as interlayer charge transfer and interlayer excitons to occur, precise control of the interface and ensuring high-quality interlayer contact is crucial. Here, we investigate bilayer heterostructures fabricated by combining chemical-vapor-deposition-grown MoS$_2$ and exfoliated WS$_2$ monolayers, allowing us to form several heterostructures with various twist angles within one preparation step. In case of sufficiently good interfacial contact, evaluated by photoluminescence quenching, we observe a twist-angle-dependent enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ Raman mode. In contrast, other WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ Raman modes (in particular, the MoS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode) do not show a clear enhancement under the same experimental conditions. We present a systematic study of this mode-selective effect using nonresonant Raman measurements that are complemented with ab-initio calculations of Raman spectra. We find that the selective enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode exhibits a strong dependence on interlayer distance. We show that this selectivity is related to the A$_{1g}$ eigenvectors in the heterolayer: the eigenvectors are predominantly localized on one of the two layers; yet, the intensity of the MoS$_2$ mode is attenuated because the WS$_2$ layer is vibrating (albeit with much lower amplitude) out of phase, while the WS$_2$ mode is amplified because the atoms on the MoS$_2$ layer are vibrating in phase. To separate this eigenmode effect from resonant Raman enhancement, our study is extended with near-resonant Raman measurements.</description>

      <title>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbit-Orbit Torques: Highly Efficient Torques on Orbital Moments Induced by Orbital Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. We term such an exotic effect as the orbit-orbit torque (OOT). Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.</description>

Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of transport and its resilience to backscattering are key features for leveraging topological matter in applications that demand stringent noise mitigation, such as metrology and quantum information processing. Due to the bosonic nature of light, engineering such robust, ``one-way'' channels in synthetic photonic systems imposes the implementation of topological models with broken time-reversal symmetry; this is challenging since photons possess neither an electric charge nor a magnetic moment. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to realizing photonic Chern insulators - topological insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry - by encoding a Haldane-like model in the synthetic frequency dimension of an optical fiber loop platform. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results open new avenues for harnessing topologically protected light propagation in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems, with applications ranging from precision metrology to photonic quantum processors.</description>

      <title>HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Benchmark of Spatial Multigraphs from the Energy Spectra of Non-Hermitian Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is transforming scientific research by revealing new ways to understand complex physical systems, but its impact remains constrained by the lack of large, high-quality domain-specific datasets. A rich, largely untapped resource lies in non-Hermitian quantum physics, where the energy spectra of crystals form intricate geometries on the complex plane -- termed as Hamiltonian spectral graphs. Despite their significance as fingerprints for electronic behavior, their systematic study has been intractable due to the reliance on manual extraction. To unlock this potential, we introduce Poly2Graph: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that automates the mapping of 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Using this tool, we present HSG-12M: a dataset containing 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic Hamiltonian spectral graphs across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, distilled from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Crucially, HSG-12M is the first large-scale dataset of spatial multigraphs -- graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. This simultaneously addresses a critical gap, as existing graph benchmarks overwhelmingly assume simple, non-spatial edges, discarding vital geometric information. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning spatial multi-edges at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics, new opportunities in geometry-aware graph learning and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spurious Strange Correlators in Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Focusing on 1D gapped bosonic/spin systems described by matrix product states (MPS), we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations (abbreviated as \emph{irrep}) in the eigenspace corresponding to the entanglment spectrum (entanglement space); (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.</description>

      <title>Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with two microwave pulses. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed thermal state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~750 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>
