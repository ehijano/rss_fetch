      <title>Revisiting multiple trapping and release electronic transport in amorphous semiconductors exemplified by a-Si:H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple trapping and release (MTR) is a typical transport mechanism of electron carriers in amorphous and other disordered semiconductors where localized states are significant. Quantitative description of MTR, however, has been based on an "abrupt" mobility edge model, which relies on two underpinning simplifications: (i) states above the conduction band mobility edge are extended and any of them is omnipresent in space, whereas states below the mobility edge are localized and they exist in space as pointlike sites; (ii) all states are evenly distributed in space, and the local density of states (DOS) distribution is spatially invariant. The prequel to this paper [Y. Luo and A. J. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)] demonstrates that neither of these simplifications is valid. Hence, this paper reinvestigates MTR transport and focuses on two similar scenarios: steady DC conduction and non-dispersive time-of-flight conduction. We have managed to reveal that, first, the experimentally measured mobility edge is an effective quantity which is different from the actual critical energy that demarcates extended states and localized states of an amorphous semiconductor. Second, the experimentally derived extended-state mobility is also an effective quantity which turns out to be higher than the actual mobility of free electrons in the material. These two effective quantities are quantified using the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) discussed in the prequel paper as an example.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced delocalization and reentrance in a Chern-Hopf insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chern-Hopf insulator is an unconventional three-dimensional topological insulator with a bulk gap and gapless boundary states without protection from global discrete symmetries. This study investigates its fate in the presence of disorder. We find it stable up to moderate disorder by analyzing the surface states and the zero energy bulk density of states using large-scale numerical simulation and the self-consistent Born approximation. The disordered Chern-Hopf insulator shows reentrant behavior: the disorder initially enhances the topological phase before driving it across an insulator-diffusive metal transition. We examine the associated critical exponents via finite-size scaling of the bulk density of states, participation entropy, and two-terminal conductance. We estimate the correlation length exponent $\nu\simeq 1.0(1)$, consistent with the clean two-dimensional Chern universality and distinct from the integer quantum Hall exponent.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of ~ 10T, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved but can be even enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bayes-optimal learning of an extensive-width neural network from quadratically many samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a single hidden layer neural network, with a quadratic activation function after the first layer, and random weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimension and the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui &amp; al '23] established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn such a function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension. That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal test error in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic in the dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations and derive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. We also provide an algorithm, that we call GAMP-RIE, which combines approximate message passing with rotationally invariant matrix denoising, and that asymptotically achieves the optimal performance. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a link with recent works on optimal denoising of extensive-rank matrices and on the ellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence of noise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights, leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test error equal to the Bayes-optimal one.</description>

      <title>Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced topological quantum phase transitions in multi-gap Euler semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of disorder in systems having a non-trivial Euler class. As these recently proposed multi-gap topological phases come about by braiding non-Abelian charged band nodes residing between different bands to induce stable pairs within isolated band subspaces, novel properties may be expected. Namely, a~modified stability and critical phases under the unbraiding to metals can arise, when the disorder preserves the underlying $C_2\cal{T}$ or $\cal{P}\cal{T}$ symmetry on average. Employing elaborate numerical computations, we verify the robustness of associated topology by evaluating the changes in the average densities of states and conductivities for different types of disorders. Upon performing a scaling analysis around the corresponding quantum critical points we retrieve a universality for the localization length exponent of $\nu = 1.4 \pm 0.1$ for Euler-protected phases, relating to two-dimensional percolation models. We generically find that quenched disorder drives Euler semimetals into critical metallic phases. Finally, we show that magnetic disorder can also induce topological transitions to quantum anomalous Hall plaquettes with local Chern numbers determined by the initial value of the Euler invariant.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolded Local Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. Our findings demonstrate that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>
