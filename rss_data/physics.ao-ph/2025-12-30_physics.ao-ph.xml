      <title>The Complete Anatomy of the Madden-Julian Oscillation Revealed by Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately defining the life cycle of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the dominant mode of intraseasonal climate variability, remains a foundational challenge due to its propagating nature. The established linear-projection method (RMM index) often conflates mathematical artifacts with physical states, while direct clustering in raw data space is confounded by a "propagation penalty." Here, we introduce an "AI-for-theory" paradigm to objectively discover the MJO's intrinsic structure. We develop a deep learning model, PhysAnchor-MJO-AE, to learn a latent representation where vector distance corresponds to physical-feature similarity, enabling objective clustering of MJO dynamical states. Clustering these "MJO fingerprints" reveals the first complete, six-phase anatomical map of its life cycle. This taxonomy refines and critically completes the classical view by objectively isolating two long-hypothesized transitional phases: organizational growth over the Indian Ocean and the northward shift over the Philippine Sea. Derived from this anatomy, we construct a new physics-coherent monitoring framework that decouples location and intensity diagnostics. This framework reduces the rates of spurious propagation and convective misplacement by over an order of magnitude compared to the classical index. Our work transforms AI from a forecasting tool into a discovery microscope, establishing a reproducible template for extracting fundamental dynamical constructs from complex systems.</description>

      <title>Neural ocean forecasting from sparse satellite-derived observations: a case-study for SSH dynamics and altimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for short-term forecasting of global sea surface dynamics based on sparse satellite altimetry data. Building on two state-of-the-art architectures: U-Net and 4DVarNet, originally developed for image segmentation and spatiotemporal interpolation respectively, we adapt the models to forecast the sea level anomaly and sea surface currents over a 7-day horizon using sequences of sparse nadir altimeters observations. The model is trained on data from the GLORYS12 operational ocean reanalysis, with synthetic nadir sampling patterns applied to simulate realistic observational coverage. The forecasting task is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence mapping, with the input comprising partial sea level anomaly (SLA) snapshots and the target being the corresponding future full-field SLA maps. We evaluate model performance using (i) normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), (ii) averaged effective resolution, (iii) percentage of correctly predicted velocities magnitudes and angles, and benchmark results against the operational Mercator Ocean forecast product. Results show that end-to-end neural forecasts outperform the baseline across all lead times, with particularly notable improvements in high variability regions. Our framework is developed within the OceanBench benchmarking initiative, promoting reproducibility and standardized evaluation in ocean machine learning. These results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of end-to-end neural forecasting models for operational oceanography, even in data-sparse conditions.</description>

      <title>Emerging trend in the east-west Dipole Pattern in Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and the associated impact on Regional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, during the monsoon season, more rainfall is received along the Western Ghats, the Northern Gangetic plains, the central belt, and northeast India. However, recently, there has been a shift in this canonical monsoon rainfall pattern on the monthly to seasonal scale. In this study, we quantify an east-west asymmetric trend in monthly to seasonal rainfall due to the increased rainfall over the northwestern part of the country. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been performed to understand the spatial and temporal variation of the monsoon. EOF mode 3 shows such a distinct east-west dipole pattern, highlighting the existence of a modal feature representing the recent trend in the rainfall distribution. The physical nature of this mode is also established. The regression pattern of the rainfall anomalies to the Webster-Yang Index (Webster and Yang, 1992) exhibits a similar east-west pattern that further confirms the physical existence of this east-west rainfall modal dipole pattern. Since rainfall across the northwest is directly linked to the Arabian Sea and rainfall over the eastern region to the Bay of Bengal, the characteristics of these two regions are studied separately. Over the Arabian Sea, there is a significant negative trend in the Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies and an increase in the specific humidity, causing greater moisture convergence. In contrast, over the Bay of Bengal, the SLP shows an increasing trend. The SST warming over the Arabian Sea is higher than that of the Bay of Bengal. Further, while investigating the zonal wind(u) at 850hPa, it shows an increasing trend along the northern branch that is more directed towards the northwestern part of the country. These factors together create dynamically favorable conditions for enhanced convection and thus receive more rainfall across the northwest compared to the northeast India.</description>

      <title>Climate change alters teleconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal modes of climate variability, such as El Ni\~no and the North Atlantic Oscillation, can have strong influences upon distant weather patterns, effects that are referred to as "teleconnections". The extent to which anthropogenic climate change has and will continue to affect these teleconnections, however, remains uncertain. Here, we employ a covariance fingerprinting approach to demonstrate that shifts in teleconnection patterns affecting monthly temperatures between the periods 1960-1990 and 1990-2020 are attributable to anthropogenic forcing. We further apply multilinear regression to assess the regional contributions and statistical significance of changes in five key climate modes: the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In many regions, observed changes exceed what would be expected from natural variability alone, further implicating an anthropogenic influence. Finally, we provide projections of how these teleconnections will alter in response to further changes in climate.</description>

      <title>Contrasting different noise models for representing westerly wind bursts in a recharge oscillator model of ENSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been known to have a major impact on the development of El Ni\~no events. In particular, they amplify these events, with stronger events associated with a higher number of WWBs. We further find indications that WWBs lead to a more monotonically increasing evolution of warming events. We consider here a noise-driven recharge oscillator model of ENSO. Commonly, WWBs are represented by a state-dependent Gaussian noise which naturally reproduces the amplification of warm events. However, we show that many properties of WWBs and their effects on sea surface temperature (SST) are not well captured by such Gaussian noise. Instead, we show that conditional additive and multiplicative (CAM) noise presents a promising alternative. In addition to recovering the sporadic nature of WWBs, CAM noise leads to an asymmetry between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events without the need for deterministic nonlinearities. Furthermore, CAM noise generates a more monotonic increase of extreme warming events with a higher frequency of WWBs accompanying the largest events. This suggests that extreme warm events are better modelled by CAM noise. To cover the full spectrum of warm events we propose a conditional noise model in which the wind stress is modelled by additive Gaussian noise for sufficiently small SSTs and by additive CAM noise once the SST exceeds a certain threshold. We show that this conditional noise model captures the observed properties of WWBs reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Using a rare event sampling technique to quantify extreme El Ni\~no event statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme El Ni\~no events, such as occurred in 1997--1998, can induce severe weather on a global scale, with significant socioeconomic impacts that motivate efforts to understand them better. However, extreme El Ni\~no events are rare, and even in a very long direct numerical simulation (DNS) occur too infrequently for robust statistical characterization. This study seeks to generate extreme El Ni\~no event model data at a lower cost, while preserving statistical fidelity, using a rare event sampling technique, which preferentially devotes computational resources toward extreme events by generating a large, branched ensemble of interrelated trajectories through successive targeted perturbations. We specifically use the ``trying-early adaptive multi-level splitting'' (TEAMS) algorithm, which is well-suited for El Ni\~no's relative timescales of predictability and event duration. We apply TEAMS to the Zebiak-Cane model, an intermediate-complexity ENSO model for which it is feasible to run a long DNS (500000 years) for validation. We compare extreme El Ni\~no event return time estimates from TEAMS to those from the long DNS to assess TEAMS' accuracy and efficiency. We find that TEAMS accurately reproduces the return time estimates of the DNS at about one fifth the computational cost. Therefore, TEAMS is an efficient approach to study rare ENSO events that can be plausibly applied to full-complexity climate models.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Distillation: Distilling 10,000 Years of Simulated Climate into Long Timestep AI Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic "student" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive "teacher" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.</description>
