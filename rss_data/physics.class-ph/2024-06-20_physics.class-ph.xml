      <title>The Paradox of the Recoil Force Acting on a Leaking Water Tank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the article, we will outline the paradoxical picture that arises when attempting to calculate the recoil force of water that leaks at the bottom of a water tank. We will present three different options for recoil force acting on the water tank as a result of this leakage (in Chapters 1, 2 and 3). In the second part of the article, we will present an experiment that resolves this question (in Chapter 4). Finally (in Chapter 5), we will present a coherent picture of the description of the leakage and the result recoil force.</description>

      <title>New Reservoir Computing Kernel Based on Chaotic Chua Circuit and Investigating Application to Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this project was to develop a new Reservoir Computer implementation, based on a chaotic Chua circuit. In addition to suitable classification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied to Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application investigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the Learning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve this, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical circuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the results of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was considered and mitigated.
  The benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current literature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with Errors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently complex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future work would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple Chua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such architectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve the Learning with Errors problem.
  This project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based Reservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to challenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also original by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their impact on performance. It demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a mass-producible, inexpensive, low-power consumption hardware neural network. It also enables the next stages in research to occur, paving the road for using Chua-based Reservoir Computers across various applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation of sympathetic cooling efficiency in a linear Paul trap driven by alternative waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling of ions or other charged particles in electromagnetic traps is an essential tool to achieve control over their degrees of freedom on the quantum level. For many objects, there is no viable route for direct cooling, such as an accessible laser cooling transition. In such a case, the sympathetic cooling can be used, where a particle with such a direct route is used to cool down the other particle via Coulomb interaction. On the downside, this cooling process often is inefficient. Here, we numerically evaluate the sympathetic cooling performance in a quadrupole ion trap for different driving waveforms. We find that using different driving waveforms and optimized trap parameters the sympathetic cooling performance can be enhanced. These results will open up the way to achieve larger sympathetic cooling rates from which many techniques, such as aluminum ion clocks, might profit.</description>

      <title>Does $E=mc^2$ Require Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is universally believed that with his 1905 paper "Does the inertia of a body depend on its energy content?" Einstein first demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy by making use of his special theory of relativity. In the final step of that paper, however, Einstein equates the kinetic energy of a body to its Newtonian value, indicating that his result is at best a low-velocity approximation. Today, several characters debate whether a mid-nineteenth century physicist, employing only physics available at the time, could plausibly arrive at the celebrated result. In other words, is Einsteinian relativity necessary to derive ${\mc E}=mc^2$?</description>
