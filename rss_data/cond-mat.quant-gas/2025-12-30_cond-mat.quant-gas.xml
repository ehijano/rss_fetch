      <title>Fast collisional $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional gates in optical superlattices have recently achieved record fidelities, but their operation times are typically limited by tunneling. Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schr\"odinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\sim 21\,\mu\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\gtrsim 99\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Optical Trapping of a Metal Hydride Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interplays Between $^3\text{P}_2$ Neutron Superfluid Vortices and $^1\text{S}_0$ Proton Fluxtubes in the Outer Core of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the outer core of neutron stars, $^3$P$_2$ superfluid neutrons and $^1$S$_0$ superconducting protons are deemed to exist, forming quantum vortices and magnetic fluxtubes, respectively. Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube.</description>

      <title>Orbital homology of p and t2g orbitals in models and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.</description>

      <title>Soliton formation in a bound state in the continuum GaN waveguide polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.</description>

      <title>Tunable Molecular Interactions Near an Atomic Feshbach Resonance: Stability and Collapse of a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

Abstract: Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules is a cornerstone of quantum chemistry. While the laboratory creation of degenerate molecular gases comprised of bosonic atoms has unlocked powerful new platforms for quantum simulation, progress is limited by the absence of a robust theoretical framework for characterizing inter-molecular interactions. This is in stark contrast to the situation for Fermi gases. In this Letter, we present such a framework providing universal expressions for these molecular scattering lengths as functions of experimentally measurable quantities. Our discoveries are crucial for understanding molecular condensate formation. Calculations of the compressibility reveal that a sign change in such molecular scattering lengths is directly correlated with the instability of these condensates. These results offer fresh insight with broad applications for atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics, as well as quantum chemistry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermalization and time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate formation in ultracold Dy-164 using a nonlinear boson diffusion equation. As compared to alkali atoms such as K-39 or Rb-87, the strong magnetic dipole interaction modifies the scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients that govern thermalization and condensate formation. A prediction for the time-dependent condensate fraction in Dy-164 is made.</description>

      <title>Floquet control of interactions and edge states in a programmable quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators based on trapped ions enable the study of spin systems and models with rich dynamical phenomena. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for fermions in one dimension is a canonical example that can support a topological insulator phase when couplings between sites are dimerized, featuring long-lived edge states. Here, we experimentally implement a spin-based variant of the SSH model using one-dimensional trapped-ion chains with tunable interaction range, realized in crystals containing up to 22 interacting spins. Using an array of individually focused laser beams, we apply site-specific, time-dependent Floquet fields to induce controlled bond dimerization. Under conditions that preserve inversion symmetry, we observe edge-state dynamics consistent with SSH-like behavior. We study the propagation and localization of spin excitations, as well as the evolution of highly excited configurations across different interaction regimes. These results demonstrate how precision Floquet engineering enables the exploration of complex spin models and dynamics, laying the groundwork for future preparation and characterization of topological and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>
