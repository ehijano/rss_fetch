      <title>Challenges and perspectives in recurrence analyses of event time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of event time series is in general challenging. Most time series analysis tools are limited for the analysis of this kind of data. Recurrence analysis, a powerful concept from nonlinear time series analysis, provides several opportunities to work with event data and even for the most challenging task of comparing event time series with continuous time series. Here, the basic concept is introduced, the challenges are discussed, and the future perspectives are summarised.</description>

      <title>Computing Lyapunov Exponents using Weighted Birkhoff Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system measure the average rate of exponential stretching along an orbit. Positive exponents are often taken as a defining characteristic of chaotic dynamics. However, the standard orthogonalization-based method for computing Lyapunov exponents converges slowly -- if at all. Many alternatively techniques have been developed to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits, though most do not compute the exponents. We compute the Lyapunov spectrum in three ways: the standard method, the weighted Birkhoff average (WBA), and the ``mean exponential growth rate for nearby orbits'' (MEGNO). The latter two improve convergence for nonchaotic orbits, but the WBA is fastest. However, for chaotic orbits the three methods convergence at similar, slow rates. Though the original MEGNO method does not compute Lyapunov exponents, we show how to reformulate it as a weighted average that does.</description>

      <title>A laminar chaotic saddle within a turbulent attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittent switchings between weakly chaotic (laminar) and strongly chaotic (bursty) states are often observed in systems with high-dimensional chaotic attractors, such as fluid turbulence. They differ from the intermittency of a low-dimensional system accompanied by the stability change of a fixed point or a periodic orbit in that the intermittency of a high-dimensional system tends to appear in a wide range of parameters. This paper considers a case where the skeleton of a laminar state $L$ exists as a proper chaotic subset $S$ of a chaotic attractor $X$, that is, $S\ \subsetneq\ X$. We characterize such a laminar state $L$ by a chaotic saddle $S$, which is densely filled with periodic orbits of different numbers of unstable directions. This study demonstrates the presence of chaotic saddles underlying intermittency in fluid turbulence and phase synchronization. Furthermore, we confirm that chaotic saddles persist for a wide range of parameters. Also, a kind of phase synchronization turns out to occur in the turbulent model.</description>

      <title>Control, bi-stability and preference for chaos in time-dependent vaccination campaign</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, effects of constant and time-dependent vaccination rates on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) seasonal model are studied. Computing the Lyapunov exponent, we show that typical complex structures, such as shrimps, emerge for given combinations of constant vaccination rate and another model parameter. In some specific cases, the constant vaccination does not act as a chaotic suppressor and chaotic bands can exist for high levels of vaccination (e.g., $&gt; 0.95$). Moreover, we obtain linear and non-linear relationships between one control parameter and constant vaccination to establish a disease-free solution. We also verify that the total infected number does not change whether the dynamics is chaotic or periodic. The introduction of a time-dependent vaccine is made by the inclusion of a periodic function with a defined amplitude and frequency. For this case, we investigate the effects of different amplitudes and frequencies on chaotic attractors, yielding low, medium, and high seasonality degrees of contacts. Depending on the parameters of the time-dependent vaccination function, chaotic structures can be controlled and become periodic structures. For a given set of parameters, these structures are accessed mostly via crisis and in some cases via period-doubling. After that, we investigate how the time-dependent vaccine acts in bi-stable dynamics when chaotic and periodic attractors coexist. We identify that this kind of vaccination acts as a control by destroying almost all the periodic basins. We explain this by the fact that chaotic attractors exhibit more desirable characteristics for epidemics than periodic ones in a bi-stable state.</description>

      <title>Study of quantum phase transition and entanglement in coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries under Floquet formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an effective time-independent Hamiltonian of a coupled kicked-top (CKT) system derived using the Van Vleck-based perturbation theory at the high-frequency driving limit under Floquet formalism. The effective Hamiltonian is a non-integrable system due to the presence of nonlinear torsional terms in the individual top and also due to the coupling between two tops. Here, we study classical and quantum versions of this coupled top system for torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases. The former model is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. At the quantum limit, depending on the system parameters, both systems satisfy BDI, or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, which is one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. We study the role of underlying symmetry on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we also investigate the interrelations among quantum phase transitions, entanglement between the tops, and the stability of the underlying classical dynamics for the system with torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases.</description>

      <title>Boundary Chaos: Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix spectral correlations is a defining feature of quantum chaos. Here, we study such correlations in a minimal model of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics where interactions are confined to the system's boundary, dubbed \textit{boundary chaos}, in terms of the spectral form factor and its fluctuations. We exactly calculate the latter in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ for different classes of random boundary interactions and find it to coincide with random matrix theory, possibly after a non-zero Thouless time. The latter effect is due to a drastic enhancement of the spectral form factor, when integer time and system size fulfill a resonance condition. We compare our semiclassical (large $q$) results with numerics at small local Hilbert space dimension ($q=2,3$) and observe qualitatively similar features as in the semiclassical regime.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the heterochaos baker maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterochaos baker maps are piecewise affine maps of the unit square or cube introduced in [Nonlinearity 34, 2021, 5744--5761], to provide a hands-on, elementary understanding of complicated phenomena in systems of large degrees of freedom. We review recent progress on a dynamical systems theory of the heterochaos baker maps, and present new results on properties of measures of maximal entropy and the underlying Lebesgue measure. We address several conjectures and questions that may illuminate new aspects of heterochaos and inspire future research.</description>
