      <title>Co-evolving networks for opinion and social dynamics in agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of digital social media has strengthened the coevolution of public opinions and social interactions, that shape social structures and collective outcomes in increasingly complex ways. Existing literature often explores this interplay as a one-directional influence, focusing on how opinions determine social ties within adaptive networks. However, this perspective overlooks the intrinsic dynamics driving social interactions, which can significantly influence how opinions form and evolve. In this work, we address this gap, by introducing the co-evolving opinion and social dynamics using stochastic agent-based models. Agents' mobility in a social space is governed by both their social and opinion similarity with others. Similarly, the dynamics of opinion formation is driven by the opinions of agents in their social vicinity. We analyze the underlying social and opinion interaction networks and explore the mechanisms influencing the appearance of emerging phenomena, like echo chambers and opinion consensus. To illustrate the model's potential for real-world analysis, we apply it to General Social Survey data on political identity and public opinion regarding governmental issues. Our findings highlight the model's strength in capturing the coevolution of social connections and individual opinions over time.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This paper explains why this happens and introduces solutions to this problem. It presents the OSMnx package's algorithms to automatically simplify graph models of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster, parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts/densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. Then it validates these algorithms and conducts a worldwide empirical assessment of count bias to quantify the motivating problem's prevalence. A full accounting of this bias and better methods to attenuate misrepresentations of intersections are necessary for data-driven, evidence-informed transport planning.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>

      <title>Indirect social influence and diffusion of innovations: An experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental feature for understanding the diffusion of innovations through a social group is the manner in which we are influenced by our own social interactions. It is usually assumed that only direct interactions, those that form our social network, determine the dynamics of adopting innovations. Here, we put this assumption to the test by experimentally and theoretically studying the role of direct and indirect influences in the adoption of innovations. We perform experiments specifically designed to capture the influence that an individual receives from their direct social ties as well as from those socially close to them, as a function of the separation they have in their social network. The results of 21 experimental sessions with more than 590 participants show that the rate of adoption of an innovation is significantly influenced not only by our nearest neighbors but also by the second and third levels of influences an adopter has. Using a mathematical model that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions in a network, we fit the experimental results and determine the way in which influences decay with social distance. The results indicate that the strength of peer pressure on an adopter coming from its second and third circles of influence is approximately 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, relative to their closest neighbors. Our results strongly suggest that innovation adoption is a complex process in which an individual feels significant pressure not only from their direct ties but also by those socially close to them.</description>

      <title>Finding Hidden Swing Voters in the 2022 Italian Elections Twitter Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global proliferation of social media platforms has transformed political communication, making the study of online interactions between politicians and voters crucial for understanding contemporary political discourse. In this work, we examine the dynamics of political messaging and voter behavior on Twitter during the 2022 Italian general elections. Specifically, we focus on voters who changed their political preferences over time (swing voters), identifying significant patterns of migration and susceptibility to propaganda messages. Our analysis reveals that during election periods, the popularity of politicians increases, and there is a notable variation in the use of persuasive language techniques, including doubt, loaded language, appeals to values, and slogans. Swing voters are more vulnerable to these propaganda techniques compared to non-swing voters, with differences in vulnerability patterns across various types of political shifts. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of social media on political opinion in Italy.</description>

      <title>An Exhaustive Study of Two-Node McCulloch-Pitts Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks are widely used in computational biology, evolutionary studies, and social sciences. However, the set of all Boolean-function-defined networks are harder to study as a whole. On the other hand, McCulloch-Pitts gates are sparsely parameterized using only a few number of link strengths, making it possible to study and compare different networks models. We treat two-node McCulloch-Pitts systems as a minimal complex system. When the link strengths are discretized, $3^4=81$ network models or rules are organized in the rule space The limiting dynamics of each rule may depend on the choice of binary state value ([-1,1] or [0,1]), and on the treatment at the threshold point, leading to at least six variants. One variant with [-1,1] as the binary state value (V1 model) tends to have a more diverse dynamical behaviors with a mixture of multiple cycles and fixed points at the limiting state, whereas other variants tend to fall only to fixed-point limiting dynamics. We use V1 models to study the organization of rules with different dynamics in the rule space and robustness of limiting dynamics with respect to a mutation in the rule table, as well as the related phenomena of phase transition and edge-of-chaos. We use another variant (V4 models) with only the fixed-point limiting dynamics to study the robustness of limiting state with respect to perturbation of initial states. The two types of robustness do not seem to be associated with each other. Other aspects of fully discretized two-node MaCulloch-Pitts networks are also studied, including: the proposal of a seventh variant based on a difference equation; relation to Rene Thomas' two types of feedback loops; spectrum properties of state space transition matrix; and asynchronous updating. Our works also expand the concept of network motifs by allowing more finer details.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>

      <title>Social Isolation, Digital Connection: COVID-19's Impact on Twitter Ego Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most impactful measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in its early first years was the lockdown, implemented by governments to reduce physical contact among people and minimize opportunities for the virus to spread. As people were compelled to limit their physical interactions and stay at home, they turned to online social platforms to alleviate feelings of loneliness. Ego networks represent how people organize their relationships due to human cognitive constraints that impose limits on meaningful interactions among people. Physical contacts were disrupted during the lockdown, causing socialization to shift entirely online, leading to a shift in socialization into online platforms. Our research aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown measures on online ego network structures potentially caused by the increase of cognitive expenses in online social networks. In particular, we examined a large Twitter dataset of users, covering 7 years of their activities. We found that during the lockdown, there was an increase in network sizes and a richer structure in social circles, with relationships becoming more intimate. Moreover, we observe that, after the lockdown measures were relaxed, these features returned to their pre-lockdown values.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on demographic mortality at high ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10279v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of modeling and therefore predicting the trend of demographic mortality is of great scientific and social interest. The article presents and discusses the hypothesis that the demographic distribution of mortality in advanced ages converges asymptotically to an S-system distribution as lifespan increases. The statistical distribution of the S-system was introduced by the author in a 2022 paper and was derived by applying the methods of Fermi statistics to a cellular automaton acting as an "arbitrary oscillator". This distribution is here recalled and formalized analytically and its characteristics are described. The conjecture is based on two case studies: mortality in the United States from 1900 to 2017 and mortality in Italy from 1974 to 2019. The conjecture, applied to both case studies, appears reasonable. Tables and comparison figures are provided to support this. Finally, an attempt to predict demographic mortality behavior and limitations for the years to come is provided.</description>

      <title>Complex Networks characterization of Indian Water Dam Systems and its topographic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper a Complex Network approach is taken to understand the salient features of Indian Water Dam Networks. Detailed analysis of 15 river basin networks have been carried out. The data has been taken from "River Basin Atlas of India" compiled by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India. The paper also investigates the correlation between various structural properties of the networks like total number of nodes, Link Density, Clustering Coefficient amongst each other and also with the Irrigation Potential and topographical features like the Elevation gradient of the region measured in meters. A mathematical model has also been proposed to understand the relation between irrigation potential measured in thousand hectares unit with the number of nodes, i.e. dams and barrages, to get a more quantitative understanding of the system. The paper also tries to observe the response of the network properties to actual topographical features of the region. This lays down a basic foundational work in understanding these water dam networks through a complex network approach over which further work can be done to make the predictions more efficient.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems in fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences often involve interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise ones. Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges, delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs' states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states, with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.</description>

      <title>From News Sharers to Post Viewers: How Topic Diversity and Conspiracy Theories Shape Engagement With Misinformation During a Health Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engagement with misinformation on social media poses unprecedented threats to societal well-being, particularly during health crises when susceptibility to misinformation is heightened in a multi-topic context. This paper focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses a critical gap in understanding online engagement with multi-topic misinformation at two user levels: news sharers who share source news items on social media and post viewers who engage with online news posts. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 7273 fact-checked source news claims related to COVID-19 and their associated posts on X, through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. We find that false news, particularly when accompanied by conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity than true news. At the news sharer level, false news has a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news. Additionally, the integration of conspiracy theories is significantly associated with a longer lifetime for COVID-19 misinformation. However, topic diversity has no significant association with news sharer engagement in terms of news lifetime and the number of posts. At the post viewer level, contrary to the news sharer level, news posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more replies compared to false news posts without conspiracy theories. Our findings suggest that news sharers and post viewers exhibit different engagement patterns on social media regarding topic diversity and conspiracy theories, offering valuable insights into designing targeted misinformation intervention strategies at both user levels.</description>
