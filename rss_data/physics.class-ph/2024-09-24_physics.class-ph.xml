      <title>Slowing and stopping the speed of sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal interference between direct and surface-reflected paths induces large variation in the group speed of an acoustic signal between a source and receiver. This speed goes to zero when the source and receiver approach one another and are within $c \tilde{\delta t}/2$ of the surface, where $c$ is the in-situ speed of sound and $\tilde{\delta t}$ is the smallest temporal separation between the paths at which interference initiates. At greater depths, the group speed can drop by many orders of magnitude. The effect diminishes far from a receiver as the size of the delay shrinks relative the overall time of propagation. The phenomenon is of great importance for methods designed to locate sounds via time differences of arrival (TDOA) as the group speed between a sound and each receiver may differ by orders of magnitude, a phenomenon that invalidates the geometrical interpretation of location by hyperboloids. Isodiachronic geometries are required to derive valid locations. Analogous to gravitational black holes, where the speed of light is zero at the event horizon, ``three-dimensional acoustical black holes'' an be present at acoustical receivers.</description>

      <title>Study of the asymptotic motion of a sporting projectile taking into account the Magnus force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classic problem of the motion of a projectile thrown at an angle to the horizon is studied. Air resistance force and Magnus force are taken into account with the use of the quadratic laws. We consider the asymptotic motion of the projectile, i.e., the motion on a sufficiently large time interval. The equations of motion are written both in Cartesian coordinates and in natural axes. The aim of the study is the analytical determination of the characteristics of asymptotic motion - the limiting angle of inclination of the trajectory to the horizontal and the terminal velocity, and obtaining an analytical representation for the velocity hodograph. No restrictions are imposed on the initial throwing conditions and other parameters. The equations of motion in Cartesian coordinates are used to find the angle of inclination of the trajectory and the terminal velocity. The equations of motion in natural axes are used to determine velocity hodograph. The velocity hodograph is defined in the form an approximate implicit analytical formula linking the trajectory angle of the projectile to its velocity. The motion of a golf ball, is presented as example. Numerical calculations show a complete coincidence of analytically found values of required quantities with numerically found values. The proposed analytical formulas can be useful for all researchers of this classical problem</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. I Field representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a study of the possibility of using a homogeneous basis and a new generalization of coupled modes theory to describe inhomogeneous accelerating sections. It was shown that the single mode representation describes the electromagnetic fields with small errors in the regular part of the section. In the couplers the accuracy is worse, but it is small enough to be used in calculations. Solving the equations of generalized coupled modes theory requires calculating the derivatives of the fields with respect to various geometrical parameters. Procedures for calculating these derivatives have been developed.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation instabilities via internal resonance in a multimode membrane as a mechanism for frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore self-induced parametric coupling, also called internal resonances (IRs), in a membrane nanoelectromechanical system. Specifically, we focus on the formation of a limit cycle manifesting as a phononic frequency comb. Utilizing a pump-noisy-probe technique and theoretical modeling, we reveal the behavior of mechanical excitations revealing themselves as sidebands of the stationary IR response. We find that when the energy-absorbing excitation of a lower mode is parametrically-upconverted to hybridize with a higher mode, significant squeezing and bimodality in the upper mode occurs. Instead, when the upconverted absorbing excitation hybridizes with an emitting sideband of the higher mode, a Hopf bifurcation occurs and a limit cycle forms, manifesting as a frequency comb. We thus reveal a unique mechanism to obtain frequency combs in parametrically-coupled modes. We furthermore demonstrate a rich variety of IR effects, the origin of which significantly extends beyond standard linear parametric coupling phenomena. Our findings enhance the understanding of energy transfer mechanisms with implications for advanced sensing technologies and novel phononic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>The classical Doppler effect revisited by the mathematical description of the phase function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to shed some more light on one of the best known phenomena in the field of physics, the Doppler effect, in particular, on its classical version. Although, as mentioned, it is a phenomenon already described more than 150 years ago, the general case, even considering constant velocities, continues to be the subject of very recent bibliographical works which either show it incompletely or start from a not entirely accurate description of it. Here, general expressions of both frequency shift and aberration are obtained by geometrical description and, more interestingly, by describing the phase of the wave in the reference frame in which the propagating medium is at rest. The coherence between the two points of view permits to contrast the validity of the proposed results, and allows for a generalization of the resulting expressions for any reference frame, even those where the propagating medium is not still.</description>

      <title>Lienard-Wiechert Potentials due to a 'classically' spinning point-charge in Non-Relativistic arbitrary motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li'enard-Wiechert potentials have been derived for a moving and 'classically' spinning point-charge; assuming it to be a small rigid charged-sphere in combined non-relativistic translational and rotational motion, and subsequently reducing its dimensions to 'point-particle' limit. The paper demonstrates that when the effect of rotation were taken into account, together with causality, expressions for the LW potentials accompany additional correction terms that contain spin-angular-momentum (or simply the 'classical-spin') of the point-charge.</description>

      <title>Allosteric propagation of curvature along filament</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can a filament transmit the curvatures across the constituting modules and control them at one of its end? Inspired by the observation of protofilament - constituent biopolymer of microtubule - this question is addressed by a constructive approach. In our model a simple allosteric element in each module couples with the neighboring modules at its interfaces, which gives rise to a single degree of freedom to control the global shape of the filament. The model can be analyzed in analogy with discrete-time dynamical systems having a bifurcation of trans-critical type.</description>

      <title>The topological dynamics of continuum lattice grid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum lattice grid structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework of the topological dynamics of continuum lattice grid structures, and discover the topological edge and corner modes in these structures. We rigorously identify the infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps via a theorem, with a clear criterion for the infinite number of topological phase transitions. Then, we obtain analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the topological phases that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to a broad range of continuum lattice grid structures including bridge-like frames, square frames, kagome frames, continuous beams on elastic springs. The frequencies of the topological modes are precisely obtained, applicable to all the bands from low- to high-frequencies. Continuum lattice grid structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topological modes at multiple frequencies on demand. Their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Physical Modeling of Piano Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a comprehensive physical model and numerical simulation schemes for a grand piano. The model encompasses various subsystems, including hammer felt, hammer shank, string, soundboard, air and room barriers, each modeled in three dimensions to approach their realistic dynamics. A general framework for 3D elastic solids accounting for prestress and prestrain is introduced, particularly addressing the the nonlinearities arising from the large deformation of piano strings and the one-sided nature of hammer felt-string contact. The study also examines coupling between subsystem through mechanisms of surface force transmission and displacement/velocity continuity. To facilitate numerical simulations, strong PDEs are translated into weak ODEs via a flexible space discretization approach. Modal transformation of system ODEs is then employed to decouple and reduce DOFs, and an explicit time discretization scheme is customized for generating digital audio in the time domain. The study concludes with a discussion of the piano models capabilities, limitations, and potential future enhancements.</description>

      <title>The Racah Algebra of Rank 2: Properties, Symmetries and Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goals of this paper are threefold. First, we provide a new ''universal'' definition for the Racah algebra of rank 2 as an extension of the rank-1 Racah algebra where the generators are indexed by subsets and any three disjoint indexing sets define a subalgebra isomorphic to the rank-1 case. With this definition, we explore some of the properties of the algebra including verifying that these natural assumptions are equivalent to other defining relations in the literature. Second, we look at the symmetries of the generators of the rank-2 Racah algebra. Those symmetries allows us to partially make abstraction of the choice of the generators and write relations and properties in a different format. Last, we provide a novel representation of the Racah algebra. This new representation requires only one generator to be diagonal and is based on an expansion of the split basis representation from the rank-1 Racah algebra.</description>

      <title>Predicting multi-parametric dynamics of externally forced oscillator using reservoir computing and minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical systems exhibit complex dynamical behavior from harmonic oscillations to chaotic motion. The dynamics undergo qualitative changes due to changes to internal system parameters like stiffness and changes to external forcing. Mapping out complete bifurcation diagrams numerically or experimentally is resource-consuming, or even infeasible. This study uses a data-driven approach to investigate how bifurcations can be learned from a few system response measurements. Particularly, the concept of reservoir computing (RC) is employed. As proof of concept, a minimal training dataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with harmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate that the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the external forcing seen during training, but it also provides qualitatively accurate and robust system response predictions for completely unknown multi-parameter regimes outside the training data. Particularly, while being trained solely on regular period-2 cycle dynamics, the proposed framework correctly predicts higher-order periodic and even chaotic dynamics for out-of-distribution forcing signals.</description>
