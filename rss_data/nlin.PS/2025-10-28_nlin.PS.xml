      <title>Linear coupling effect induced beating non-degenerate vector solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to generate a new class of beating vector solitons. Unlike earlier procedures that use dark-bright or bright-dark soliton solutions to generate beating solitons, the method described here utilizes non-degenerate vector soliton solutions of the Manakov system. It involves linear superposition of such soliton solutions along with an intensity switching mechanism facilitated by cross-coupling between the optical modes. We find that the obtained beating solitons collide elastically with themselves and keep their beating feature unchanged after the collision. We also find that their beating nature can be controlled by allowing them to collide with degenerate beating solitons exhibiting energy-sharing collisions. The results presented in this work will provide new insights into beating solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, and related areas of research.</description>

      <title>Midveins regulate the shape formation of drying leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.</description>

      <title>Constrained instantons in scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instantons, localised saddle points of the action, play an important role in describing non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories, for example vacuum decay or violation of conservation laws associated with anomalous symmetries. However, there are theories in which no saddle point exists. In this paper, we revisit the idea of constrained instantons, proposed initially by Affleck in 1981, and develop it into a complete method for computing the vacuum decay rate in such cases. We apply this approach to the massive scalar field theory with a negative quartic self-interaction using two different constraints. We solve the field equations numerically and find a two-branch structure, with two distinct solutions for each value of the constraint. By counting the negative modes, we identify one branch of solutions as the constrained instantons and the other as the minima of the action subject to the constraint. We discuss their significance for the computation of the vacuum decay rate.</description>

      <title>Strongly chirped dissipative solitons in normal and anomalous dispersion regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an adiabatic theory for strongly chirped dissipative solitons governed by the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and analyze their existence regions in both normal- and anomalous-dispersion regimes. Closed-form expressions for the spectrum, peak power, and energy allow a compact dimensionless parameterization of the dissipative soliton parametric space. The analysis reveals that dissipative-soliton resonance, i.e., chirp-driven temporal stretching with bounded peak power, naturally emerges on the scalable branch, providing a direct pathway to high-energy femtosecond oscillators without the need for external amplification. We establish a basis for interpreting these results within a thermodynamic framework that connects energy ``condensation'' in the soliton to a BEC-like metaphor, providing quantitative indicators for energy scalability limits and breakup onsets, and aligning with a recently formulated thermodynamic methodology for dissipative solitons. Beyond immediate laser design guidance, our approach suggests a generalized thermodynamic theory of strongly chirped dissipative solitons, including measurable entropy/temperature proxies and a phase diagram that delineates single- versus multi-soliton states. This unifies practical laser-engineering criteria with many-body concepts, pointing to optics-based, metaphorical simulations of condensate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Soft Robot Control via Adiabatic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness in tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a high-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and a Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm. Notably, we find that five- or six-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to $10$ across all closed-loop control tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry, strong second harmonic generation, and ferroelectricity with nonlinear phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.</description>

      <title>Soliton interaction and bound state formation in coupled Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soliton dynamics in coupled Kerr microcavities is an important aspect of frequency comb technologies, with applications in optical communication and precision metrology. We investigate a minimal system consisting of two nearly identical coupled Kerr microresonators, each operating in the soliton regime and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and stability. Numerical simulations indicate that asymmetric perturbations can alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings highlight previously unexplored regimes of dissipative soliton organization and suggest new strategies for controlling soliton ensembles in integrated photonic platforms.</description>
