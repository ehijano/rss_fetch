      <title>A pair of possible supernovae Refsdal in the Pantheon+ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On December 1980, supernova 1980N was discovered in NGC 1316, a galaxy of the Fornax cluster. Three months later, supernova 1981D was observed in the same galaxy. The light curves of these two supernovae Ia were found to be virtually identical, suggesting that they are images of the same event, the delay between them being due to strong gravitational lensing. If so, as anticipated by Sjur Refsdal, the distance to the lens can be determined accurately, namely, 90 $\pm$ 1 kpc, meaning that it belongs to the outer halo of the Milky Way.
  Interestingly, there is another pair of possible images in the Pantheon+ sample, namely, supernovae 2013aa and 2017cbv, the distance to the lens being 702 $\pm$ 1 kpc, that is, nearly the same as the distance to the Andromeda galaxy.
  In both cases, given the relatively large angle of deviation of the supernova light by the lens, namely, 271" and 325", respectively, the lens has to be a compact object, with a mass to radius ratio over 150 M$_\odot$ R$_\odot^{-1}$. It is likely to be an ultra massive white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Orbital distributions, intrinsic shapes, and mass profiles for MAGPI-like Eagle galaxies using Schwarzschild dynamical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schwarzschild dynamical models are now regularly employed in large surveys of galaxies in the local and distant Universe to derive information on galaxies' intrinsic properties such as their orbital structure and their (dark matter and stellar) mass distribution. Comparing the internal orbital structures and mass distributions of galaxies in the distant Universe with simulations is key to understanding what physical processes are responsible for shaping galaxy properties. However it is first crucial to understand whether observationally derived properties are directly comparable with intrinsic ones in simulations. To assess this, we build Schwarzschild dynamical models for MUSE-like IFS cubes (constructed to be like those obtained by the MAGPI survey) of 75 galaxies at z ~ 0.3 from the Eagle simulations. We compare the true particle-derived properties with the galaxies' model-derived properties. In general, we find that the models can recover the true galaxy properties qualitatively well, with the exception of the enclosed dark matter, where we find a median offset of 48%, which is due to the assumed NFW profile not being able to reproduce the dark matter distribution in the inner region of the galaxies. We then compare our model-derived properties with Schwarzschild models-derived properties of observed MAGPI galaxies and find good agreement between MAGPI and Eagle: the majority of our galaxies (57%) have non-oblate shapes within 1 effective radius. More triaxial galaxies show higher fractions of hot orbits in their inner regions and tend to be more radially anisotropic.</description>

      <title>Dust-UV offsets in high-redshift galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn III simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial offsets between dust and ultraviolet (UV) emission in high-redshift galaxies using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation. Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at z=5-7, compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. Our simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model, naturally reproduces these offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies (log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm{DM}}$/M$_{\odot}$)&gt;11.5, M$_{\rm{AB1500}}$&lt;-20). We find that dust-UV offsets increase with halo mass and UV brightness, reaching up to $\sim 2$ pkpc for the most massive systems, in good agreement with observational data from the ALPINE and REBELS surveys. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. The dust remains well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between star formation, dust distribution, and observed galaxy morphologies during the epoch of reionization, highlighting the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: a complete census of the bright and red distant Universe with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin$^2$ from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (&gt;70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W&gt;2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2&lt;z&lt;7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across $1&lt;z_{phot}&lt;10$ with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at $z_{phot}&gt;3$ using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range ($z_{spec}\sim1-9$), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive ($M_*\sim10^{10-11.5} M_\odot$) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.</description>

      <title>Effects of stellar feedback on cores in STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form in dense cores within molecular clouds and newly formed stars influence their natal environments. How stellar feedback impacts core properties and evolution is subject to extensive investigation. We performed a hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) analysis of a STARFORGE simulation modelling a giant molecular cloud to identify gas overdensities (cores) and study changes in their radius, mass, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter with respect to stellar feedback. We binned these cores on the basis of the fraction of gas affected by protostellar outflows, stellar winds, and supernovae and analysed the property distributions for each feedback bin. We find that cores that experience more feedback influence are smaller. Feedback notably enhances the velocity dispersion and virial parameter of the cores, more so than it reduces their radius. This is also evident in the linewidth-size relation, where cores in higher feedback bins exhibit higher velocities than their similarly sized pristine counterparts. We conclude that stellar feedback mechanisms, which impart momentum to the molecular cloud, simultaneously compress and disperse the dense molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Radiation Fields in Star-Forming Disk Galaxies: Numerical Simulations with TIGRESS-NCR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With numerical simulations that employ adaptive ray-tracing (ART) for radiative transfer at the same time as evolving gas magnetohydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and photochemistry, it is possible to obtain a high resolution view of ultraviolet (UV) fields and their effects in realistic models of the multiphase interstellar medium. Here, we analyze results from TIGRESS-NCR simulations, which follow both far-UV (FUV) wavelengths, important for photoelectric heating and PAH excitation, and the Lyman continuum (LyC), which photoionizes hydrogen. Considering two models, representing solar neighborhood and inner galaxy conditions, we characterize the spatial distribution and time variation of UV radiation fields, and quantify their correlations with gas. We compare four approximate models for the FUV to simulated values to evaluate alternatives when full ART is infeasible. By convolving FUV radiation with density, we produce mock maps of dust emission. We introduce a method to calibrate mid-IR observations, for example from JWST, to obtain high resolution gas surface density maps. We then consider the LyC radiation field, finding most of the gas exposed to this radiation to be in ionization-recombination equilibrium and to have a low neutral fraction. Additionally, we characterize the ionization parameter as a function of environment. Using a simplified model of the LyC radiation field, we produce synthetic maps of emission measure (EM). We show that the simplified model can be used to extract an estimate of the neutral fraction of the photoionized gas and mean free path of ionizing radiation from observed EM maps in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing the high frequency variability of NGC 5044: the key to AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray bright intragroup medium (IGrM), as well as parsec scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) high frequency observations of NGC5044 to assess the time variability of the mm-waveband emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) from the radio to sub-millimeter band. The SED is well described by advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with tau ~1kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1pc, and the magnetic field to 4.7mG in the jets and and 870G in the accretion disk. A longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies with Unusually Bright Globular Cluster Luminosity Functions via a Mark-Dependently Thinned Point Process (MATHPOP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textsc{Mathpop}, a novel method to infer the globular cluster (GC) counts in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and low-surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). Many known UDGs have a surprisingly high ratio of GC number to surface brightness. However, standard methods to infer GC counts in UDGs face various challenges, such as photometric measurement uncertainties, GC membership uncertainties, and assumptions about the GC luminosity functions (GCLFs). \textsc{Mathpop} tackles these challenges using the mark-dependent thinned point process, enabling joint inference of the spatial and magnitude distributions of GCs. In doing so, \textsc{Mathpop} allows us to infer and quantify the uncertainties in both GC counts and GCLFs with minimal assumptions. As a precursor to \textsc{Mathpop}, we also address the data uncertainties coming from the selection process of GC candidates: we obtain probabilistic GC candidates instead of the traditional binary classification based on the color--magnitude diagram. We apply \textsc{Mathpop} to 40 LSBGs in the Perseus cluster using GC catalogs from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging program. We then compare our results to those from an independent study using the standard method. We further calibrate and validate our approach through extensive simulations. Our approach reveals two LSBGs having GCLF turnover points much brighter than the canonical value with Bayes' factor being $\sim4.5$ and $\sim2.5$, respectively. An additional crude maximum-likelihood estimation shows that their GCLF TO points are approximately $0.9$~mag and $1.1$~mag brighter than the canonical value, with $p$-value $\sim 10^{-8}$ and $\sim 10^{-5}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Census of the beta Pic Moving Group and Other Nearby Associations with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I have used the third data release of the Gaia mission to improve the reliability and completeness of membership samples in the beta Pic moving group (BPMG) and other nearby associations with ages of 20-50 Myr (Sco Body, Carina, Columba, chi1 For, Tuc-Hor, IC 2602, IC 2391, NGC 2547). I find that Carina, Columba, and chi1 For are physically related and coeval, and that Carina is the closest fringe of a much larger association. Similarly, Tuc-Hor and IC 2602 form a coeval population that is spatially and kinematically continuous. Both results agree with hypotheses from Gagne et al. (2021). I have used the new catalogs to study the associations in terms of their initial mass functions, X-ray emission, ages, and circumstellar disks. For instance, using the model for Li depletion from Jeffries et al. (2023), I have derived an age of 24.7+0.9/-0.6 Myr for BPMG, which is similar to estimates from previous studies. In addition, I have used infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to check for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the members of the associations, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of known disks around M stars at ages of 30-50 Myr and a significant improvement in measurements of excess fractions for those spectral types and ages. Most notably, I find that the W3 excess fraction for M0-M6 initially declines with age to a minimum in BPMG &lt;0.015), increases to a maximum in Carina/Columba chi1 For (0.041+0.009/-0.007, 34 Myr), and declines again in the oldest two associations (40-50 Myr). The origin of that peak and the nature of the M dwarf disks at &gt;20 Myr are unclear.</description>

      <title>The Abundance and Properties of Barred Galaxies out to $z \sim$ 4 Using $\textit{JWST}$ CEERS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze $\textit{JWST}$ CEERS NIRCam images to present {the first estimate} of the observed fraction and properties of bars out to $z \sim 4$. We analyze a sample of 1770 galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star &gt; 10^{10} M_\odot$ at $0.5 \leq z \leq 4$ and identify barred galaxies via ellipse fits and visual classification of both F200W and F444W images. Our results apply mainly to bars with projected semi-major axis $a_{\rm bar}$ $&gt; 1.5 $ kpc ($\sim$ 2 $\times$ PSF in F200W images) that can be robustly traced by ellipse fits. For such bars, the {observed} bar fraction at $z\sim$ 2-4 is low ($\lesssim 10\%$), and they appear to be emerging at least as early as $z\sim 4$ when the Universe was $\sim$ 13\% of its present age. At $z\sim$ 2-4, compared to our results, TNG50 simulations {predict} a significantly larger bar fraction due to a large population of small bars with $a_{\rm bar}$ $&lt; 1.5$ kpc {that we cannot robustly detect}. If such a population exists, the true bar fraction may be significantly higher than our results. At $z \ge 1.5$, many barred galaxies show nearby neighbors, suggesting bars may be tidally triggered. {From $z \sim 4$ to $z \sim 0.5$, the observed bar fraction, average projected bar length, and projected bar strength rise.} Our results highlight the early emergence and evolution of barred galaxies and the rising importance of bar-driven secular evolution from $z \sim$4 to today.</description>

      <title>FAST Ultra-Deep Survey (FUDS): Data Release for FUDS0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to make a blind ultra-deep survey for neutral hydrogen (HI). We present the complete results from the first of six fields (FUDS0). This observation of 95 hours allowed us to achieve a high sensitivity ($\sim 50~\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$) and a high frequency resolution (22.9 kHz) over an area of 0.72 deg$^2$. We detected 128 galaxies in HI distributed over the redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.4$ with HI masses in the range of $6.67 \leq \log(M_{\rm HI}/h_{70}^{-2} \rm M_\odot) \leq 10.92$, and three faint high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with peak column density of $N_{\rm HI} \leq 3.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$. Of the galaxies, 95 are new detections and six have $z &gt; 0.38$, where no unlensed HI emission has previously been directly detected. Estimates of completeness and reliability are presented for the catalog. Consistency of continuum and HI flux estimates with NVSS and AUDS, respectively, confirms the accuracy of calibration method and data reduction pipeline developed for the full FUDS survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe II/Mg II emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to alpha-element abundances in the broad line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe II/Mg II ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(L_bol[erg s^-1])~47.3 and cover a redshift range of z=6.0-6.6. The median value of the measured Fe II/Mg II ratios is ~7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ~2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe II/Mg II in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z=3.5-4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z=1.0-2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe II/Mg II ratio over the wide redshift range from z=1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Physical Processes Behind the Co-Evolution of Halos, Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes in the IllustrisTNG Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the co-evolution of dark matter halos, their central galaxies, and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulation. We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.</description>

      <title>Sifting the debris: Patterns in the SNR population with unsupervised ML methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) carry vast amounts of mechanical and radiative energy that heavily influence the structural, dynamical, and chemical evolution of galaxies. To this day, more than 300 SNRs have been discovered in the Milky Way, exhibiting a wide variety of observational features. However, existing classification schemes are mainly based on their radio morphology. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning pipeline to analyse a representative subsample of the Galactic SNR population ($\sim$ 50% of the total) with the aim of finding a connection between their multi-wavelength features and their physical properties. The pipeline involves two stages: (1) a representation learning stage, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder that feeds on imagery from infrared and radio continuum surveys (WISE 22$\mu$m, Hi-GAL 70 $\mu$m and SMGPS 30 cm) and produces a compact representation in a lower-dimensionality latent space; and (2) a clustering stage that seeks meaningful clusters in the latent space that can be linked to the physical properties of the SNRs and their surroundings. Our results suggest that this approach, when combined with an intermediate uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) reprojection of the autoencoded embeddings into a more clusterable manifold, enables us to find reliable clusters. Despite a large number of sources being classified as outliers, most clusters relate to the presence of distinctive features, such as the distribution of infrared emission, the presence of radio shells and pulsar wind nebulae, and the existence of dust filaments.</description>

      <title>JADES: Measuring reionization properties using Lyman-alpha emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ is the transition to the ground state from the first excited state of hydrogen (the most common element). Resonant scattering of this line by neutral hydrogen greatly impedes its emergence from galaxies, so the fraction of galaxies which show Ly$\alpha$ is a tracer of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and thus the history of reionization. In previous works, we used early JWST/NIRSpec data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to classify and characterise Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs). This survey is now approaching completion, and the current sample is nearly an order of magnitude larger. From a sample of 784 galaxies in JADES at $4.0&lt;z&lt;14.3$, we find evidence for Ly$\alpha$ emission in 145 sources. We reproduce the previously found correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction (\fesc) - Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width (\rew) and the negative correlation between Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset - \fesc. Both \fesc and \rew decrease with redshift ($z\gtrsim5.5$), indicating the progression of reionization on a population scale. Our data are used to demonstrate an increasing IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from $z\sim14-6$. We measure the completeness-corrected fraction of LAEs ($X_{Ly\alpha}$) from $z=4-9.5$. An application of these $X_{Ly\alpha}$ values to the results of cosmological models suggests a high neutral fraction at $z=7$ ($\rm X_{HI}=0.81_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$), likely suggesting the need for models with updated \rew distributions (based on comparison to other works). This large sample of LAEs and the completeness correction we have detailed will be paramount for unbiased population studies of galaxies in the EoR.</description>

      <title>The molecular gas content throughout the low-z merger sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting IRAM 30 m CO spectroscopy, we find that SDSS post-merger galaxies display gas fractions and depletion times enhanced by 25-50%, a mildly higher CO excitation, and standard molecular-to-atomic gas ratios, compared to non-interacting galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) and star-formation rate (SFR). To place these results in context, we compile further samples of interacting or starbursting galaxies, from pre-coalescence kinematic pairs to post-starbursts, carefully homogenising gas mass, $M_{\star}$ and SFR measurements in the process. We explore systematics by duplicating our analysis for different SFR and $M_{\star}$ estimators, finding good qualitative agreement in general. Molecular gas fractions and depletion times are enhanced in interacting pairs, albeit less than for post-mergers. Among all samples studied, gas fraction and depletion time enhancements appear largest in young (a few 100 Myr) post-starbursts. While there is only partial overlap between post-mergers and post-starbursts, this suggests that molecular gas reservoirs are boosted throughout most stages of galaxy interactions, plausibly due to torque-driven inflows of halo gas and gas compression. The gas fraction and depletion time offsets of mergers and post-starbursts anti-correlate with their distance from the galaxy main sequence $\Delta({\rm MS})$, evidencing the role of SFE in driving the high SFRs of the strongest starbursts. Post-starbursts display the steepest dependency of gas fraction and SFE-offsets on $\Delta({\rm MS})$, with an evolving normalisation that reflects gas reservoir depletion over time. Our multi-sample analysis paints a coherent picture of the starburst-merger throughout the low-z merger sequence. It reconciles contradictory literature findings by highlighting that gas fraction enhancements and SFE variations both play their part in merger-driven star formation.</description>

      <title>MAMBO -- An empirical galaxy and AGN mock catalogue for the exploitation of future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present MAMBO, a flexible and efficient workflow to build empirical galaxy and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) mock catalogues that reproduce the physical and observational properties of these sources.
  Methods. We start from simulated dark matter (DM) haloes, to preserve the link with the cosmic web, and we populate them with galaxies and AGN using abundance matching techniques. We follow an empirical methodology, using stellar mass functions (SMF), host galaxy AGN mass functions and AGN accretion rate distribution functions studied at different redshifts to assign, among other properties, stellar masses, the fraction of quenched galaxies, or the AGN activity (demography, obscuration, multiwavelength emission, etc.).
  Results. As a proof test, we apply the method to a Millennium DM lightcone of 3.14 $\rm deg^2$ up to redshift $z=10$ and down to stellar masses $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} \, M_\odot$. We show that the AGN population from the mock lightcone here presented reproduces with good accuracy various observables, such as state-of-the-art luminosity functions in the X-ray up to $z \sim 7$ and in the ultraviolet up to $z \sim 5$, optical/NIR colour-colour diagrams, and narrow emission line diagnostic diagrams. Finally, we demonstrate how this catalogue can be used to make useful predictions for large surveys. Using \textit{Euclid} as a case example, we compute, among other forecasts, the expected surface densities of galaxies and AGN detectable in the \textit{Euclid} $H_{\rm E}$ band. We find that \textit{Euclid} might observe (on $H_{\rm E}$ only) about $10^{7}$ and $8 \times 10^{7}$ Type 1 and 2 AGN respectively, and $2 \times 10^{9}$ galaxies at the end of its 14 679 $\rm deg^2$ Wide survey, in good agreement with other published forecasts.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Observation of the TeV-Detected Radio Galaxy 3C 264: Core Emission and the Hot Accretion Flow Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3C 264 is one of the few FRI radio galaxies with detected TeV emission. It is a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and is generally associated with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Earlier multiwavelength studies suggest that the X-ray emission originates from a jet. However, the possibility that the RIAF can significantly contribute to the X-rays cannot be ruled out. In particular, hard X-ray emission $\gtrsim$10 keV has never been detected, making it challenging to distinguish between X-ray models. Here we report a NuSTAR detection up to 25 keV from 3C 264. We also present subpixel deconvolved Chandra images to resolve jet emission down to ~0.2 arcsec from the center of the unresolved X-ray core. Together with a simultaneous Swift observation, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. We found evidence of a cutoff in the energy around 20 keV, indicating that at least some of the X-rays from the core can be attributed to the RIAF. The Comptonization model suggests an electron temperature of about 15 keV and an optical depth ranging between 4 and 7, following the universality of coronal properties of black hole accretion. The cutoff energy or electron temperature of 3C 264 is the lowest among those of other LLAGNs. The detected hard X-ray emission is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by synchrotron self-Compton models introduced to explain $\gamma$-ray and TeV emission, suggesting that the synchrotron electrons might be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought.</description>

      <title>The Role of High-mass Stellar Binaries in the Formation of High-mass Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (&gt;=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. Furthermore, we study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers as a function of fb_15_prime.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy in environments: detectability prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase following a binary black hole coalescence is a powerful tool for measuring properties of the remnant black hole. Future gravitational wave detectors will increase the precision of these measurements and may be sensitive to the environment surrounding the black hole. This work examines how environments affect the ringdown from a binary coalescence. Our analysis shows that for astrophysical parameters and sensitivity of planned detectors, the ringdown signal is indistinguishable from its vacuum counterpart, suggesting that ringdown-only analyses can reliably extract the (redshifted) mass and spin of the remnant black hole. These conclusions include models with spectral instabilities, suggesting that these are not relevant from an observational viewpoint. Deviations from inspiral-only estimates could then enhance the characterisation of environmental effects present during the coalescence.</description>

      <title>CCAT: A status update on the EoR-Spec instrument module for Prime-Cam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization Spectrometer (EoR-Spec) is an upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) instrument designed to study the evolution of the early universe (z = 3.5 to 8) by probing the redshifted [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line from aggregates of galaxies. The [CII] emission is an excellent tracer of star formation since it is the dominant cooling line from neutral gas heated by OB star light and thus can be used to probe the reionization of the early Universe due to star formation. EoR-Spec will be deployed on Prime-Cam, a modular direct-detection receiver for the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), currently under construction by CPI Vertex Antennentechnik GmbH and to be installed near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert. This instrument features an image plane populated with more than 6500 Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that are illuminated by a 4-lens optical design with a cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) at the pupil of the optical system. The FPI is designed to provide a spectral resolving power of $R\sim100$ over the full spectral range of 210--420 GHz. EoR-Spec will tomographically survey the E-COSMOS and E-CDFS fields with a depth of about 4000 hours over a 5 year period. Here we give an update on EoR-Spec's final mechanical/optical design and the current status of fabrication, characterization and testing towards first light in 2026.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Outflows and Dusty Disks during the AGB to PN Transition: The PANORAMA survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars evolve to planetary nebulae (PNe), the mass outflow geometries transform from nearly spherical to extreme aspherical. The physical mechanisms governing this transformation are widely believed to be linked to binarity and the associated production of disks and fast jets during transitional (post-AGB) evolutionary stages. We are carrying out a systematic ALMA survey ($P$re-planet$A$ry $N$ebulae high-angular-res$O$lution su$R$vey with $A$L$MA$ or PANORAMA) of a representative sample of bipolar and multipolar post-AGB objects. We have obtained high angular-resolution (0".1-0".4) observations of the CO(3--2) and/or 6--5 emission in order to probe the spatio-kinematic structure of the collimated outflows and the central disk/torii. The results are remarkable, generally showing the presence of bipolar or multipolar high-velocity outflows, dense toroidal waists, and in one case, a geometrically-thin circular ring around the central bipolar nebula. A high degree of point-symmetry characterizes the morphology of the mass ejecta. In this contribution, we present these and other highlights from our survey. We aim to use 2D/3D radiative transfer modeling in order to derive accurate outflow momenta, masses and mass-loss rates for our sample, and build hydrodynamical models that can explain the observed spatio-kinematic structures. These results will then be used to distinguish between different classes of PN-shaping binary interaction models.</description>

Abstract: A general covariant Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Four-Dimensional (4D EGB) spacetime is shown to bypass Lovelock's theorem and is free from Ostrogradsky instability. Meanwhile, the bumblebee theory is a vector-tensor theory. It extends the Einstein--Maxwell theory that allows for the spontaneous symmetry breaking that leads to the field acquiring a vacuum expectation value, introducing Lorentz violation into the system. We investigate rotating black holes in the 4D EGB-bumblebee gravity model where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken -- Kerr EGB bumblebee (KEGBB) black holes. The latest observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) M87* and Sgr A* have sparked intensified interest in the study of black hole shadows, which present a novel avenue for investigating SMBHs within the strong-field regime. Motivated by this, we model SMBHs M87* and Sgr A* as KEGBB black holes, and using the EHT observation result, for given $l$, to find earlier upper limits on the $\alpha$ and $a$ are altered. The KEGBB and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in some parameter space, and one cannot rule out the possibility that the former may serve as strong candidates for astrophysical black holes. Employing our newly developed parameter estimation technique, we use two EHT observables -- namely, the angular diameter of the shadow, $d_{sh}$, and the axial ratio, $\mathcal{D}_A$ -- to estimate parameters of M87* and Sgr A* taking into account observational errors associated with the EHT results.</description>

      <title>Planetary nebulae seen with TESS: New and revisited short-period binary central star candidates from Cycles 1 to 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06332</link>

Abstract: High-precision and high-cadence photometric surveys such as Kepler or TESS are making huge progress not only in the detection of new extrasolar planets but also in the study of a great number of variable stars. This is the case for central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe), which have similarly benefited from the capabilities of these missions, increasing the number of known binary central stars and helping us to constrain the relationship between binarity and the complex morphologies of their host PNe. In this paper, we analyse the TESS light curves of a large sample of central stars of PNe with the aim of detecting signs of variability that may hint at the presence of short-period binary nuclei. We analysed 62 central stars of true, likely, or possible PNe and modelled the detected variability through an MCMC approach accounting for three effects: reflection, ellipsoidal modulations, and Doppler beaming. Among the 62 central stars, only 38 are amenable for this study. The remaining 24 show large contamination from nearby sources preventing an optimal analysis. Also, eight targets are already known binary central stars, which we revisit here with the new high precision of the TESS data. In addition, we find that 18 further central stars show clear signs of periodic variability in the TESS data, probably resulting from different physical effects compatible with the binary scenario. We propose them as new candidate binary central stars. We also discuss the origin of the detected variability in each particular case by using the TESS_localize algorithm. Finally, 12 targets show no or only weak evidence of variability at the sensitivity of TESS. Our study demonstrates the power of space-based photometric surveys in searching for close binary companions of central stars of PNe.</description>

      <title>Contour Analysis Tool: an interactive tool for background and morphology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Contour Analysis Tool (CAT), a Python toolkit aimed at identifying and analyzing structural elements in density maps. CAT employs various contouring techniques, including the lowest-closed contour (LCC), linear and logarithmic Otsu thresholding, and average gradient thresholding. These contours can aid in foreground and background segmentation, providing natural limits for both, as well as edge detection and structure identification. Additionally, CAT provides image processing methods such as smoothing, background removal, and image masking. The toolkit features an interactive suite of controls designed for Jupyter environments, enabling users to promptly visualize the effects of different methods and parameters. We describe, test, and demonstrate the performance of CAT, highlighting its potential use cases. CAT is publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Discovery of young, oxygen-rich supernova remnants in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the late stages of supernovae before their merging into the surrounding medium. Oxygen-rich supernova remnants represent a rare subtype with strong visible light oxygen emission. Aims. We present a new method to detect SNRs exploiting the capabilities of modern visible-light integral-field units based on the shapes of the SNR emission lines. Methods. We search for unresolved shocked regions with broadened emission lines using the medium-resolution integral-field spectrograph MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. The spectral resolving power allows shocked emission sources to be differentiated from photoionised sources based on the linewidths. Results. We find 307 supernova remnants, including seven O-rich SNRs. For all O-rich SNRs, we observe the [O III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emission doublet. In addition, we observe emissions from [O I]{\lambda}{\lambda}6300,6364, [O II]{\lambda}{\lambda}7320,7330, H{\alpha}+[N II]{\lambda}6583 and [S II]{\lambda}{\lambda}6717,6731 to varying degrees. The linewidths for the O-rich SNRs are generally broader than the rest of the SNRs in the sample of this article. The oxygen emission complexes are reminiscient of SNR 4449-1 and some long-lasting SNe. For the O-rich SNRs, we also search for counterparts in archival data of other telescopes; we detect X-ray and mid-IR counterparts for a number of remnants. Conclusions. We have shown efficacy of the method to detect SNRs presented in this article. In addition, the method is also effective in detecting the rare O-rich SNRs, doubling the sample size in the literature. The origin of O-rich SNRs and their link to specific SN types or environments is still unclear, but further work into this new sample will unquestionably help us shed light on these rare remnants.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the "acceleration-plane analysis" for a variety of samples and the "stacked velocity profile analysis" for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase metallicity gradients in galaxies at $z \sim 6-8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of gas-phase metallicity and its spatial distribution at high redshift is crucial to understand the processes that shaped the growth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. Here we study the spatially resolved metallicity in three systems at $z\sim6-8$, namely A2744-YD4, BDF-3299, and COSMOS24108, with JWST NIRSpec IFU low-resolution ($R\sim100$) spectroscopic observations. These are among the highest-$z$ sources in which metallicity gradients have been probed so far. Each of these systems hosts several spatial components in the process of merging within a few kpc, identified from the rest-frame UV and optical stellar continuum and ionised gas emission line maps. The sources have heterogeneous properties, with stellar masses log($M_*/M_\odot) \sim 7.6-9.3$, star formation rates (SFRs) $\sim1-15$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and gas-phase metallicities 12+log(O/H) $\sim 7.7-8.3$, which exhibit a large scatter within each system. Their properties are generally consistent with those of the highest-$z$ samples to date ($z\sim3-10$), though the sources in A2744-YD4 and COSMOS24108 are at the high end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) defined by the $z\sim3-10$ sources. Moreover, the targets in this work follow the predicted slope of the MZR at $z\sim 6-8$ from most cosmological simulations. The gas-phase metallicity gradients are consistent with being flat in the main sources of each system. Flat metallicity gradients are thought to arise from gas mixing processes on galaxy scales, such as mergers or galactic outflows and SN winds driven by intense stellar feedback, which wash out any gradient formed in the galaxy. The existence of flat gradients at $z\sim6-8$ sets also important constraints on cosmological simulations and chemical evolution models, whose predictions on the cosmic evolution of metallicity gradients differ significantly, but are mostly limited to $z&lt;3$ so far.</description>

      <title>The rate and contribution of mergers to mass assembly from NIRCam observations of galaxy candidates up to 13.3 billion years ago</title>

Abstract: We present an analysis of the galaxy merger rate in the redshift range $4.0&lt;z&lt;9.0$ (i.e. about 1.5 to 0.5 Gyr after the Big Bang) based on visually identified galaxy mergers from morphological parameter analysis. Our dataset is based on high-resolution NIRCam JWST data (a combination of F150W and F2000W broad-band filters) in the low-to-moderate magnification ($\mu&lt;2$) regions of the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a parent set of 675 galaxies $(M_{U}\in[-26.6,-17.9])$, we identify 64 merger candidates from the Gini, $M_{20}$ and Asymmetry morphological parameters, leading to a merger fraction $f_m=0.11\pm0.04$. There is no evidence of redshift evolution of $f_m$ even at the highest redshift considered, thus extending well into the epoch of reionization the constant trend seen previously at $z\lesssim 6$. Furthermore, we investigate any potential redshift dependent differences in the specific star formation rates between mergers and non-mergers. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation in this regard, with deviations in the studied redshift range typically falling within $(1-1.5)\sigma$ from the null hypotesis that can be attributed to sample variance and measurement errors. Finally, we also demonstrate that the classification of a merging system is robust with respect to the observed (and equivalently rest-frame) wavelength of the high-quality JWST broad-band images used. This preliminary study highlights the potential for progress in quantifying galaxy assembly through mergers during the epoch of reionization, with significant sample size growth expected from upcoming large JWST infrared imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>

Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Cluster Formation II. Runaway Stars as Fossils of Sub-Cluster Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. In the binary supernova scenario (BSS), a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. In the dynamical ejection scenario, a star is ejected during a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the subcluster ejection scenario (SCES), where a subset of stars from an infalling subcluster is ejected out of the cluster via a tidal interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of the formation of a young massive cluster from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of subcluster mergers determined by the initial turbulent, spherical conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming subclusters fall into the central potential, where they are tidally disrupted, forming tidal tails of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed in the same SCES have similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling subclusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent via a subsequent BSS ejection. An SCES-BSS ejection is a possible avenue for the creation of hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. We expect nonspherical initial gas distributions to increase the number of calculated runaway stars. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via the SCES can thus reveal the assembly history of their natal clusters.</description>

Abstract: We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF), in bins of redshift, of quasars selected in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). A sample of 915 objects was selected at $2.7&lt;z&lt;5.3$ within an effective area of $\sim 36$ deg$^2$ observed in 40 narrow-band filters (NB; FWHM $\sim 120$ \r{A}). We cover the intermediate-bright luminosity regime of the LF $(10^{43.5}&lt;(L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;10^{45.5}$; $-29&lt;M_{\rm UV}&lt;-24)$. The continuous wavelength coverage of the PAUS NB set allows a very efficient target identification and precise redshift measurements. We show that our method is able to retrieve a fairly complete ($C\sim 85\%$) and pure ($P\sim 90\%$) sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitting quasars for $L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}&gt;10^{44}$ ${\rm erg\,s}$$^{-1}$. In order to obtain corrections for the LF estimation, and assess the accuracy of our selection method, we produced mock catalogs of $0&lt;z&lt;4.3$ quasars and galaxies that mimic our target population and their main contaminants. Our results show a clear evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ and UV LFs, with a declining tendency in the number density of quasars towards increasing redshifts. In addition, the faint-end power-law slope of the Ly$\alpha$ LF becomes steeper with redshift, suggesting that the number density of Ly$\alpha$-bright quasars declines faster than that of fainter emitters. By integrating the Ly$\alpha$ LF we find that the total Ly$\alpha$ emitted by bright quasars per unit volume rapidly declines with increasing redshift, being sub-dominant to that of star-forming galaxies by several orders of magnitude by $z\sim 4$. Finally, we stack the NB pseudo-spectra of a visually selected "golden sample" of 591 quasars to obtain photometric composite SEDs in bins of redshift, enabling to measure the mean IGM absorption by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a function of redshift.</description>

      <title>Mapping radial abundance gradients with Gaia-ESO open clusters: Evidence of recent gas accretion in the Milky Way disk</title>

Abstract: Context. Recent evidences from spectroscopic surveys point towards the presence of a metal-poor, young stellar population in the chemical thin disk. In this context, the investigation of the spatial distribution and time evolution of precise, unbiased abundances is fundamental to disentangle the scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. Aims. We study the evolution of abundance gradients in the Milky Way by taking advantage of a large sample of open clusters, which are among the best tracers for this purpose. In particular, we use data from the last release of the Gaia-ESO survey. Methods. We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1&lt;Age/Gyr&lt;3) and young (Age&lt;1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Properties of Central Regions of the Dark Matter Halos in the Model with a Bump in the Power Spectrum of Density Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02739</link>

Abstract: A surprisingly large number of galaxies with masses of $\sim10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z\geq9$ are discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope. A possible explanation for the increase in the mass function can be the presence of a local maximum (bump) in the power spectrum of density perturbations on the corresponding scale. In this paper, it is shown that simultaneously with the growth of the mass function, galaxies from the bump region must have a higher density (compactness) compared to cosmological models without a bump. These more compact galaxies have been partially included in larger galaxies and have been subjected to tidal gravitational disruption. They have been less destructed than ``ordinary'' galaxies of the same mass, and some of them could survive to $z = 0$ and persist on the periphery of some galaxies. The formation and evolution of compact halos in a cube with a volume of $(47 \,\text{Mpc})^3$ with $(1024)^3$ dark matter particles in the redshift range from 120 to 0 have been numerically simulated and observational implications of the presence of such galaxies in the current Universe have been discussed.</description>

      <title>McFine: python-based Monte-Carlo multi-component hyperfine structure fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling complex line emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a degenerate, high-dimensional problem. Here, we present McFine, a tool for automated multi-component fitting of emission lines with complex hyperfine structure, in a fully automated way. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to efficiently explore the complex parameter space, allowing for characterising model denegeracies. This tool allows for both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and radiative-transfer (RT) models. McFine can fit individual spectra and data cubes, and for cubes encourage spatial coherence between neighbouring pixels. It is also built to fit the minimum number of distinct components, to avoid overfitting. We have carried out tests on synthetic spectra, where in around 90~per~cent of cases it fits the correct number of components, otherwise slightly fewer components. Typically, $T_{\rm ex}$ is overestimated and $\tau$ underestimated, but accurate within the estimated uncertainties. The velocity and line widths are recovered with extremely high accuracy, however. We verify McFine by applying to a large Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) N$_2$H$^+$ mosaic of an high-mass star forming region, G316.75-00.00. We find a similar quality of fit to our synthetic tests, aside from in the active regions forming O-stars, where the assumptions of Gaussian line profiles or LTE may break down. To show the general applicability of this code, we fit CO(J = 2-1) observations of NGC 3627, a nearby star-forming galaxy, again obtaining excellent fit quality. McFine provides a fully automated way to analyse rich datasets from interferometric observations, is open source, and pip-installable.</description>

      <title>The External Heating of Dust in a Homogeneous Spherical Shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a procedure for calculating the heating of, and the infrared emission from, dust in a homogeneous spherical shell surrounded by a spherically symmetric source of radiation. The results are applicable to newly formed dust either in supernova ejecta or in the circumstellar medium that has been swept up by the expanding shock wave. They can also be applied to the heating and IR emission from dust in clumps or clouds embedded in a homogeneous radiation field.</description>

      <title>Stellar reddening map from DESI imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new Galactic reddening maps of the high Galactic latitude sky using DESI imaging and spectroscopy. We directly measure the reddening of 2.6 million stars by comparing the observed stellar colors in $g-r$ and $r-z$ from DESI imaging with the synthetic colors derived from DESI spectra from the first two years of the survey. The reddening in the two colors is on average consistent with the \cite{fitzpatrick_correcting_1999} extinction curve with $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1$. We find that our reddening maps differ significantly from the commonly used \cite{schlegel_maps_1998} (SFD) reddening map (by up to 80 mmag in $E(B-V)$), and we attribute most of this difference to systematic errors in the SFD map. To validate the reddening map, we select a galaxy sample with extinction correction based on our reddening map, and this yields significantly better uniformity than the SFD extinction correction. Finally, we discuss the potential systematic errors in the DESI reddening measurements, including the photometric calibration errors that are the limiting factor on our accuracy. The $E(g-r)$ and $E(g-r)$ maps presented in this work, and for convenience their corresponding $E(B-V)$ maps with SFD calibration, are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Microlensing and event rate of static spherically symmetric wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11134v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study focuses on the impact of microlensing in modern cosmology and introduces a new framework for the static spherically symmetrical wormhole in terms of the radial equation of state. Following a standard procedure, the study calculates the lensing equation, magnification, and event rate based on the the radial equation of state. The analysis highlights that the image problem of the light source is complex. Furthermore, the study suggests that larger values for the throat radius of the wormhole and the radial equation of state lead to higher event rates. Additionally, it is proposed that the event rate of a wormhole will be larger compared to that of a black hole, provided their masses and distances from the light source and observer are comparable. This study offers the potential to distinguish between a wormhole and a black hole under similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for AGN Studies with AXIS: AGN Fueling -- Resolving Hot Gas inside Bondi Radius of SMBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot gas around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) should be captured within the gravitational "sphere of influence", characterized by the Bondi radius. Deep Chandra observations have spatially resolved the Bondi radii of five nearby SMBHs that are believed to be accreting in hot accretion mode. Contrary to earlier hot accretion models that predicted a steep temperature increase within the Bondi radius, none of the resolved temperature profiles exhibit such an increase. The temperature inside the Bondi radius appears to be complex, indicative of a multi-temperature phase of hot gas with a cooler component at about 0.2-0.3 keV. The density profiles within the Bondi regions are shallow, suggesting the presence of strong outflows. These findings might be explained by recent realistic numerical simulations that suggest that large-scale accretion inside the Bondi radius can be chaotic, with cooler gas raining down in some directions and hotter gas outflowing in others. With an angular resolution similar to Chandra and a significantly larger collecting area, AXIS will collect enough photons to map the emerging accretion flow within and around the "sphere of influence" of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AXIS will reveal transitions in the inflow that ultimately fuels the AGN, as well as outflows that provide feedback to the environment.</description>

      <title>IPA: Class 0 Protostars Viewed in CO Emission Using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five protostars in their primary mass assembly phase using new observations from JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). CO line emission images and fluxes are extracted for a forest of $\sim$150 ro-vibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, $v=1-0$ and $v=2-1$. However, ${}^{13}$CO is undetected, indicating that ${}^{12}$CO emission is optically thin. We use H$_2$ emission lines to correct fluxes for extinction and then construct rotation diagrams for the CO lines with the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity to estimate rotational temperatures and numbers of CO molecules. Two distinct rotational temperature components are required for $v=1$ ($\sim600$ to 1000 K and 2000 to $\sim 10^4$ K), while one hotter component is required for $v=2$ ($\gtrsim 3500$ K). ${}^{13}$CO is depleted compared to the abundances found in the ISM, indicating selective UV photodissociation of ${}^{13}$CO; therefore, UV radiative pumping may explain the higher rotational temperatures in $v=2$. The average vibrational temperature is $\sim 1000$ K for our sources and is similar to the lowest rotational temperature components. Using the measured rotational and vibrational temperatures to infer a total number of CO molecules, we find that the total gas masses range from lower limits of $\sim10^{22}$ g for the lowest mass protostars to $\sim 10^{26}$ g for the highest mass protostars. Our gas mass lower limits are compatible with those in more evolved systems, which suggest the lowest rotational temperature component comes from the inner disk, scattered into our line of sight, but we also cannot exclude the contribution to the CO emission from disk winds for higher mass targets.</description>
