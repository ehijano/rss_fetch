      <title>Nonconcave Robust Utility Maximization under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a robust utility maximization problem in a general discrete-time frictionless market. The investor is assumed to have a random, nonconcave and nondecreasing utility function, which may or may not be finite on the whole real-line. She also faces model ambiguity on her beliefs about the market, which is modeled through a set of priors. We prove, using only primal methods, the existence of an optimal investment strategy when the utility function is also upper-semicontinuous. For that, we introduce the new notion of projectively measurable functions. We show basic properties of these functions as stability under sums, differences, products, suprema, infima and compositions but also assuming the set-theoretical axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD) stability under integration and existence of $\epsilon$-optimal selectors. We consider projectively measurable random utility function and price process and assume that the graphs of the sets of local priors are projective sets. Our other assumptions are stated on a prior-by-prior basis and correspond to generally accepted assumptions in the literature on markets without ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Risk premium and rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One the one hand, rough volatility has been shown to provide a consistent framework to capture the properties of stock price dynamics both under the historical measure and for pricing purposes. On the other hand, market price of volatility risk is a well-studied object in Financial Economics, and empirical estimates show it to be stochastic rather than deterministic. Starting from a rough volatility model under the historical measure, we take up this challenge and provide an analysis of the impact of such a non-deterministic risk for pricing purposes.</description>

      <title>Default Resilience and Worst-Case Effects in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the resilience of a network of banks to joint price fluctuations of the external assets in which they have shared exposures, and evaluate the worst-case effects of the possible default contagion. Indeed, when the prices of certain external assets either decrease or increase, all banks exposed to them experience varying degrees of simultaneous shocks to their balance sheets. These coordinated and structured shocks have the potential to exacerbate the likelihood of defaults. In this context, we introduce first a concept of {default resilience margin}, $\epsilon^*$, i.e., the maximum amplitude of asset prices fluctuations that the network can tolerate without generating defaults. Such threshold value is computed by considering two different measures of price fluctuations, one based on the maximum individual variation of each asset, and the other based on the sum of all the asset's absolute variations. For any price perturbation having amplitude no larger than $\epsilon^*$, the network absorbs the shocks remaining default free. When the perturbation amplitude goes beyond $\epsilon^*$, however, defaults may occur. In this case we find the worst-case systemic loss, that is, the total unpaid debt under the most severe price variation of given magnitude. Computation of both the threshold level $\epsilon^*$ and of the worst-case loss and of a corresponding worst-case asset price scenario, amounts to solving suitable linear programming problems.}</description>

      <title>Utility maximization under endogenous pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.04312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expected utility maximization problem of a large investor who is allowed to make transactions on tradable assets in an incomplete financial market with endogenous permanent market impacts. The asset prices are assumed to follow a nonlinear price curve quoted in the market as the utility indifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier. We show that optimality can be fully characterized via a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which corresponds to a non-linear backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). We show existence of solutions to the optimal investment problem and the FBSDEs in the case where the driver function of the representative market maker grows at least quadratically or the utility function of the large investor falls faster than quadratically or is exponential. Furthermore, we derive smoothness results for the existence of solutions of BSPDEs. Examples are provided when the market is complete or the utility function is exponential.</description>

      <title>Quasi-sure essential supremum and applications to finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When uncertainty is modelled by a set of non-dominated and non-compact probability measures, a notion of essential supremum for a family of real-valued functions is developed in terms of upper semi-analytic functions. We show how the properties postulated on the initial functions carry over to their quasi-sure essential supremum. We propose various applications to financial problems with frictions. We analyse super-replication and prove a bi-dual characterization of the super-hedging cost. We also study a weak no-arbitrage condition called Absence of Instantaneous Profit (AIP) under which prices are finite. This requires new results on the aggregation of quasi-sure statements.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Equilibrium with Insider Information and General Uninformed Agent Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a continuous time economy where agents have asymmetric information. The informed agent (``$I$''), at time zero, receives a private signal about the risky assets' terminal payoff $\Psi(X_T)$, while the uninformed agent (``$U$'') has no private signal. $\Psi$ is an arbitrary payoff function, and $X$ follows a time-homogeneous diffusion. Crucially, we allow $U$ to have von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences with a general utility function on $(0,\infty)$ satisfying the standard conditions. This extends previous constructions of equilibria with asymmetric information used when all agents have exponential utilities and enables us to study the impact of $U$'s initial share endowment on equilibrium. To allow for $U$ to have general preferences, we introduce a new method to prove existence of a partial communication equilibrium (PCE), where at time $0$, $U$ receives a less-informative signal than $I$. In the single asset case, this signal is recoverable by viewing the equilibrium price process over an arbitrarily short period of time, and hence the PCE is a dynamic noisy rational expectations equilibrium. Lastly, when $U$ has power (constant relative risk aversion) utility, we identify the equilibrium price in the small and large risk aversion limits.</description>

      <title>Stochastic expansion for the pricing of Asian and basket options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed analytical approximations for the pricing of basket options, also applicable to Asian options with discrete averaging under the Black-Scholes model with time-dependent parameters. The formulae are obtained by using a stochastic Taylor expansion around a log-normal proxy model and are found to be highly accurate for Asian options in practice as well as for vanilla options with discrete dividends.</description>
