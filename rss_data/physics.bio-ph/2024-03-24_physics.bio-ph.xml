      <title>Physics-based signal analysis of genome sequences: GenomeBits overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive overview of the recent physics-inspired genome analysis tool, GenomeBits, is presented. This is based on traditional signal processing methods such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). GenomeBits can be used to extract underlying genomics features from the distribution of nucleotides, and can be further used to analyze the mutation patterns in viral genomes. Examples of the main GenomeBits findings outlining the intrinsic signal organization of genomics sequences for different SARS-CoV-2 variants along the pandemic years 2020-2022 and Monkeypox cases in 2021 are presented to show the usefulness of GenomeBits. GenomeBits results for DFT of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in different geographical regions are discussed together with the GenomeBits analysis of complete genome sequences for the first coronavirus variants reported: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Eta. Interesting features of the Delta and Omicron variants in the form of a unique "order-disorder" transition are uncovered from these samples as well as from their cumulative distribution function and scatter plots. This class of transitions might reveal the cumulative outcome of mutations on the spike protein. A salient feature of GenomeBits is the mapping of the nucleotide bases (A,T,C,G) into an alternating spin-like numerical sequence via a series having binary (0,1) indicators for each A,T,C,G. This leads to derive a set of statistical distribution curves. Furthermore, the quantum-based extension of the GenomeBits model to an analogous probability measure is shown to identify properties of genome sequences as wavefunctions via a superposition of states. An association of the integral of the GenomeBits coding and a binding-like energy can in principle also be established. The relevance of these different results in Bioinformatics is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Selective advantage of aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of glycolysis in aerobic conditions have been a subject of debate for more than a century. A hypothesis supported by previous data is that glycolysis has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass and per occupied volume than oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). However, a recent work by Shen et al14 challenges previous estimates, reporting that OxPhos has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass than glycolysis. Here I show that Shen et al14 make a key assumption that is a subject of debate: that the proteomic cost of OxPhos is limited to proteins in enzymes of OxPhos and the TCA cycle. I argue that an intact mitochondria is required for functional OxPhos and therefore the whole mitochondrial protein content should be included for the cost estimate of OxPhos. After doing so, glycolysis is the most efficient pathway per protein mass or per volume fraction.</description>

      <title>Neurophotonics beyond the Surface: Unmasking the Brain's Complexity Exploiting Optical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate nature of the brain necessitates the application of advanced probing techniques to comprehensively study and understand its working mechanisms. Neurophotonics offers minimally invasive methods to probe the brain using optics at cellular and even molecular levels. However, multiple challenges persist, especially concerning imaging depth, field of view, speed, and biocompatibility. A major hindrance to solving these challenges in optics is the scattering nature of the brain. This perspective highlights the potential of complex media optics, a specialized area of study focused on light propagation in materials with intricate heterogeneous optical properties, in advancing and improving neuronal readouts for structural imaging and optical recordings of neuronal activity. Key strategies include wavefront shaping techniques and computational imaging and sensing techniques that exploit scattering properties for enhanced performance. We discuss the potential merger of the two fields as well as potential challenges and perspectives toward longer term in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent covariance reveals critical spatio-temporal patterns of synchronized activity in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining advanced theoretical techniques and high-quality data from thousands of simultaneously recorded neurons provide strong support for the hypothesis that neural dynamics operate near the edge of instability across regions in the brain. However, these analyses, as well as related studies, often fail to capture the intricate temporal structure of brain activity as they primarily rely on time-integrated measurements across neurons. In this study, we present a novel framework designed to explore signatures of criticality across diverse frequency bands and construct a much more comprehensive description of brain activity. Additionally, we introduce a method for projecting brain activity onto a basis of spatio-temporal patterns, facilitating time-dependent dimensionality reduction. Applying this framework to a magnetoencephalography dataset, we observe significant differences in both criticality signatures and spatio-temporal activity patterns between healthy subjects and individuals with Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Universal Cold RNA Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA's diversity of structures and functions impacts all life forms since primordia. We use calorimetric force spectroscopy to investigate RNA folding landscapes in previously unexplored low-temperature conditions. We find that Watson-Crick RNA hairpins, the most basic secondary structure elements, undergo a glass-like transition below $\mathbf{T_G\sim 20 ^{\circ}}$C where the heat capacity abruptly changes and the RNA folds into a diversity of misfolded structures. We hypothesize that an altered RNA biochemistry, determined by sequence-independent ribose-water interactions, outweighs sequence-dependent base pairing. The ubiquitous ribose-water interactions lead to universal RNA phase transitions below $\mathbf{T_G}$, such as maximum stability at $\mathbf{T_S\sim 5 ^{\circ}}$C where water density is maximum, and cold denaturation at $\mathbf{T_C\sim-50^{\circ}}$C. RNA cold biochemistry may have a profound impact on RNA function and evolution.</description>
