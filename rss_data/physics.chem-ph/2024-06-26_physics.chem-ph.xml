      <title>Stimulated emission of virtual photons: Energy transfer by light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-transfer processes can be viewed as being due to the emission of a virtual photon. It is demonstrated that the emission of virtual photons and thus of energy transfer is stimulated by the sheer presence of photons. We concentrate here on interatomic/intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) where an excited system relaxes by transferring its excess energy to a neighbor ionizing it. ICD is inactive if this excess energy is insufficiently large. However, in the presence of photons, the long-range interaction between the system and its neighbor can utilize the photon field making ICD active. The properties of this stimulated-ICD mechanism are discussed. The concept can be transferred to other scenarios. We discuss collective-ICD where two excited molecules concertedly transfer their excess energy. Also here, the presence of photons can make the process active if the sum of excess energies were insufficient to do so. Examples with typical molecules and atoms are presented to demonstrate that these stimulated processes can play a role.</description>

      <title>Low temperature formation of pyridine and (iso)quinoline via neutral neutral reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aromatic molecules represent fundamental building blocks in prebiotic chemistry and are contemplated as vital precursors to DNA and RNA nitrogen bases. However, despite the identification of some 300 molecules in extraterrestrial environments, the pathways to pyridine (C5H5N), pyridinyl (C5H4N), and (iso)quinoline (C9H7N) the simplest representative of mono and bicyclic aromatic molecule carrying nitrogen are elusive. Here, we afford compelling evidence on the gas phase formation of methylene amidogen (H2CN) and cyanomethyl (H2CCN) radicals via molecular beam studies and electronic structure calculations. The modeling of the chemistries of Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC 1) and Titans atmosphere contemplates a complex chain of reactions synthesizing pyridine, pyridinyl, and (iso)quinoline from H2CN and H2CCN at levels of up to 75%. This study affords unique entry points to precursors of DNA and RNA nitrogen bases in hydrocarbon rich extraterrestrial environments thus changing the way we think about the origin of prebiotic molecules in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Binding energies of ethanol and ethylamine on interstellar water ices: synergy between theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental and computational chemistry are two disciplines to conduct research in Astrochemistry, providing essential reference data for both astronomical observations and modeling. These approaches not only mutually support each other, but also serve as complementary tools to overcome their respective limitations. We characterized the binding energies (BEs) of ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH) and ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$), two interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs), onto crystalline and amorphous water ices through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Experimentally, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ behave similarly, in which desorption temperatures are higher on the water ices than on a bare gold surface. Computed cohesive energies of pure ethanol and ethylamine bulk structures allow describing the BEs of the pure species deposited on the gold surface, as extracted from the TPD curve analyses. The BEs of submonolayer coverages of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ on the water ices cannot be directly extracted from TPD due to their co-desorption with water, but they are computed through DFT calculations, and found to be greater than the cohesive energy of water. The behaviour of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$ is different when depositing adsorbate multilayers on the amorphous ice, in that, according to their computed cohesive energies, ethylamine layers present weaker interactions compared to ethanol and water. Finally, from the computed BEs of ethanol, ethylamine and water, we can infer that the snow-lines of these three species in protoplanetary disks will be situated at different distances from the central star. It appears that a fraction of ethanol and ethylamine is already frozen on the grains in the water snow-lines, causing their incorporation in water-rich planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Abnormal Collective Effects via the Non-Monotonic Number Dependence of Electron Transfer in Confined Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling within an optical cavity leverages the collective interactions of molecules and confined electromagnetic fields, giving rise to the possibilities of modifying chemical reactivity and molecular properties. While collective optical responses, such as enhanced Rabi splitting, are often observed, the overall effect of the cavity on molecular systems remains ambiguous for a large number of molecules. In this paper, we investigate the non-adiabatic electron transfer (ET) process in electron donor-acceptor pairs influenced by collective excitation and local molecular dynamics. Using the timescale difference between reorganization and thermal fluctuations, we derive analytical formulas for the electron transfer rate constant and the polariton relaxation rate. These formulas apply to any number of molecules ($N$) and account for the collective effect as induced by cavity photon coupling. Our findings reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the rate constant on $N$, which can be understood by the interplay between electron transfer and polariton relaxation. As a result, the cavity-induced quantum yield increases linearly with $N$ for small $N$ (as predicted by a simple Dicke model), but shows a turnover and suppression for large $N$ (consistent with the large $N$ problem of polariton chemistry). We also interrelate the thermal bath frequency and the number of molecules, suggesting the optimal number for maximizing enhancement. The analysis provides an analytical insight for understanding the collective excitation of light and electron transfer, helping to predict the optimal condition for effective cavity-controlled chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>A microscopic approach to crystallization: challenging the classical/non-classical dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that a theoretical description of nucleation based on fluctuating hydrodynamics and classical density functional theory can be used to determine non-classical nucleation pathways for crystallization (Lutsko, Sci. Adv. 5, eaav7399 (2019)). The advantage of the approach is that it is free of any assumptions regarding order parameters and that requires no input other than molecular interaction potentials. We now extend this fundamental framework so as to describe the dynamics of non-classical nucleation. We use it to study the nucleation of both droplets and crystalline solids from a low-concentration solution of colloidal particles using two different interaction potentials. We find that the nucleation pathways of both droplets and crystals are remarkably similar at the early stages of nucleation until they diverge due to a rapid ordering along the solid pathways in line with the paradigm of "non-classical" crystallization. We compute the unstable modes at the critical clusters and find that despite the non-classical nature of solid nucleation, the size of the nucleating clusters remains the principle order parameter in all cases supporting a "classical" description of the {\it dynamics} of crystallization. We show that nucleation rates can be extracted from our formalism in a systematic way. Our results suggest that in some cases, despite the non-classical nature of the nucleation pathways, classical nucleation theory can give reasonable results for solids but that there are circumstances where it may fail. This contributes a nuanced perspective to recent experimental and simulation work suggesting that important aspects of crystal nucleation can be described within a classical framework.</description>

      <title>Probing the effects of broken symmetries in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

      <title>Efficient real space formalism for hybrid density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient real space formalism for hybrid exchange-correlation functionals in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). In particular, we develop an efficient representation for any function of the real space finite-difference Laplacian matrix by leveraging its Kronecker product structure, thereby enabling the time to solution of associated linear systems to be highly competitive with the fast Fourier transform scheme, while not imposing any restrictions on the boundary conditions. We implement this formalism for both the unscreened and range-separated variants of hybrid functionals. We verify its accuracy and efficiency through comparisons with established planewave codes for isolated as well as bulk systems. In particular, we demonstrate up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in time to solution for the real space method. We also apply the framework to study the structure of liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics, where we find good agreement with literature. Overall, the current formalism provides an avenue for efficient real space DFT calculations with hybrid density functionals.</description>

      <title>Flux and fluence effects on the Vacuum-UV photodesorption and photoprocessing of CO$_2$ ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CO$_2$ is a major component of the icy mantles surrounding dust grains in planet and star formation regions. Understanding its photodesorption is crucial for explaining gas phase abundances in the coldest environments of the interstellar medium irradiated by vacuum-UV (VUV) photons. Photodesorption yields determined experimentally from CO$_2$ samples grown at low temperatures (T=15~K) have been found to be very sensitive to experimental methods and conditions. Several mechanisms have been suggested for explaining the desorption of CO$_2$, O$_2$ and CO from CO$_2$ ices. In the present study, the cross sections characterizing the dynamics of photodesorption as a function of photon fluence (determined from released molecules in the gas phase) and of ice composition modification (determined in situ in the solid phase) are compared for the first time for different photon flux conditions (from 7.3$\times 10^{12}$~photon/s/cm$^2$ to 2.2$\times 10^{14}$~photon/s/cm$^2$) using monochromatic synchrotron radiation in the VUV range (on the DESIRS beamline at SOLEIL). This approach reveals that CO and O$_2$ desorption are decorrelated from that of CO$_2$. CO and O$_2$ photodesorption yields depend on photon flux conditions and can be linked to surface chemistry. By contrast, the phodesorption yield of CO$_2$ is independent of the photon flux conditions and can be linked to bulk ice chemical modification, consistently with an indirect desorption induced by electronic transition (DIET) process.</description>

      <title>Perovskite nanocrystal self-assemblies in 3D hollow templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly ordered nanocrystal (NC) assemblies, namely superlattices (SLs), have been investigated as novel building blocks of optical and optoelectronic devices due to their unique properties based on interactions among neighboring NCs. In particular, lead halide perovskite NC SLs have attracted significant attention, owing to their extraordinary optical characteristics of individual NCs and collective emission processes like superfluorescence (SF). So far, the primary method for preparing perovskite NC SLs has been the drying-mediated self-assembly method, in which the colloidal NCs spontaneously assemble into SLs during solvent evaporation. However, this method lacks controllability because NCs form random-sized SLs at random positions on the substrate rendering NC assemblies in conjunction with device structures such as photonic waveguides or microcavities challenging. Here, we demonstrate template-assisted self-assembly to deterministically place perovskite NC SLs and control their geometrical properties. A solution of CsPbBr3 NCs is drop-casted on a substrate with lithographically-defined hollow structures. After solvent evaporation and removal of excess NCs from the substrate surface, NCs only remain in the templates thereby defining the position and size of these NC assemblies. We performed photoluminescence (PL) measurements on these NC assemblies and observed signatures of SF, similar as in spontaneously assembled SLs. Our findings are crucial for optical devices that harness embedded perovskite NC assemblies and prepare fundamental studies on how these collective effects can be tailored through the SL geometry.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Parameter Optimization of the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework has been instrumental in advancing near-term quantum algorithms. However, parameter optimization remains a significant bottleneck for VQE, requiring a large number of measurements for successful algorithm execution. In this paper, we propose sequential optimization with approximate parabola (SOAP) as an efficient and robust optimizer specifically designed for parameter optimization of the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz on quantum computers. SOAP leverages sequential optimization and approximates the energy landscape as quadratic functions, minimizing the number of energy evaluations required to optimize each parameter. To capture parameter correlations, SOAP incorporates the average direction from the previous iteration into the optimization direction set. Numerical benchmark studies on molecular systems demonstrate that SOAP achieves significantly faster convergence and greater robustness to noise compared to traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, numerical simulations up to 20 qubits reveal that SOAP scales well with the number of parameters in the ansatz. The exceptional performance of SOAP is further validated through experiments on a superconducting quantum computer using a 2-qubit model system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory Calculations by Coupling Orbital and Occupation Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) calculations are usually implemented in a decoupled manner, where the orbital and occupation optimizations are repeated alternately. Typically, orbital updates are performed using the unitary optimization method, while occupations are optimized through the explicit-by-implicit (EBI) method. The EBI method addresses explicit constraints by incorporating implicit functions, effectively transforming constrained optimization scenarios into unconstrained minimizations. Although the unitary and EBI methods individually achieve robust performance in optimizing orbitals and occupations, respectively, the decoupled optimization methods often suffer from slow convergence and require dozens of alternations between the orbital and occupation optimizations. To address this issue, this work proposes a coupled optimization method that combines unitary and EBI optimizations to update orbitals and occupations simultaneously at each step. To achieve favorable convergence in coupled optimization using a simple first-order algorithm, an effective and efficient preconditioner and line search are further introduced. The superiority of the new method is demonstrated through numerous tests on different molecules, random initial guesses, different basis sets and different functionals. It outperforms all decoupled optimization methods in terms of convergence speed, convergence results and convergence stability. Even a large system like $\mathrm{C_{60}}$ can converge to $10^{-8}$ au in 154 iterations, which shows that the coupled optimization method can make RDMFT more practical and facilitate its wider application and further development.</description>

      <title>Softmax parameterization of the occupation numbers for natural orbital functionals based on electron pairing approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of natural orbital functional theory, having a convenient representation of the occupation numbers and orbitals becomes critical for the computational performance of the calculations. Recognizing this, we propose an innovative parametrization of the occupation numbers that takes advantage of the electron-pairing approach used in Piris natural orbital functionals through the adoption of the softmax function, a pivotal component in modern deep-learning models. Our approach not only ensures adherence to the N-representability of the first-order reduced density matrix (1RDM) but also significantly enhances the computational efficiency of 1RDM functional theory calculations. The effectiveness of this alternative parameterization approach was assessed using the W4-17-MR molecular set, which demonstrated faster and more robust convergence compared to previous implementations.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with the widely-used hybrid and double hybrid functionals in computational costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. As case studies, we apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Catalysis in Extreme Field Environments: The Case of Strongly Ionized $SiO_{2}$ Nanoparticle Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High electric fields can significantly alter catalytic environments and the resultant chemical processes. Such fields arise naturally in biological systems but can also be artificially induced through localized excitations at nanoscale. Recently, strong field excitation of dielectric nanoparticles has emerged as an avenue for studying catalysis in highly ionized environments producing extreme electric fields. While the dynamics of surface ion emission driven by ultrafast laser ionization has been heavily explored, understanding the molecular dynamics leading to fragmentation has remained elusive. To address this, we employed a multiscale approach utilizing non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulations on hydrogenated silica surfaces in both bare and wetted environments under field conditions mimicking those of an ionized nanoparticle. Our findings indicate that hole localization drives fragmentation dynamics, leading to surface silanol dissociation within 50 fs and charge transfer-induced water splitting in wetted environments within 150 fs. Further insight into such ultrafast mechanisms is critical for advancement of catalysis on the surface of charged nanosystems.</description>

      <title>Determining the Dielectric Constant of Solid/Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dielectric constant ($\varepsilon^{\prime}$) of interfacial water is an important parameter, but its measurement has posed challenges, and no consensus has been reached on a generalized expression. We derived a formula for $\varepsilon^{\prime}$ of a buried interface using the slab model for a half-solvated sphere: $ \varepsilon^{\prime}=\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2\left(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1+6\right) / 2\left(2 \varepsilon_2+\varepsilon_1\right)$, where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the dielectric constants of the solid and liquid phases, respectively. We experimentally validated this expression using vibrational sum frequency generation and Fresnel factor calculations for interfaces of alumina with water ($ \mathrm{H_2O} $ and $ \mathrm{D_2O} $) and acetonitrile. This fills an important knowledge gap in the description of the dielectric constant of interfaces.</description>

      <title>Improved Modularity and New Features in ipie: Towards Even Larger AFQMC Calculations on CPUs and GPUs at Zero and Finite Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ipie is a Python-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) package that has undergone substantial improvements since its initial release [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. This paper outlines the improved modularity and new capabilities implemented in ipie. We highlight the ease of incorporating different trial and walker types and the seamless integration of ipie with external libraries. We enable distributed Hamiltonian simulations, allowing for multi-GPU simulations of large systems. This development enabled us to compute the interaction energy of a benzene dimer with 84 electrons and 1512 orbitals, which otherwise would not have fit on a single GPU. We also support GPU-accelerated multi-slater determinant trial wavefunctions [arXiv:2406.08314] to enable efficient and highly accurate simulations of large-scale systems. This allows for near-exact ground state energies of multi-reference clusters, [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. We also describe implementations of free projection AFQMC, finite temperature AFQMC, AFQMC for electron-phonon systems, and automatic differentiation in AFQMC for calculating physical properties. These advancements position ipie as a leading platform for AFQMC research in quantum chemistry, facilitating more complex and ambitious computational method development and their applications.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, irreversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>
