      <title>Endoscopic fiber-coupled diamond magnetometer for cancer surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interoperative measurements using magnetic sensors is a valuable technique in cancer surgery for finding magnetic tracers. Here we present a fiber-coupled nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center magnetometer capable of detecting iron oxide suspension (MagTrace from Endomagnetics Ltd.) used in breast cancer surgeries. Detection of an iron mass as low as 0.56~mg has been demonstrated, 100 times less than that of a recommended dose at a maximum distance of 5.8~mm. Detection of an iron concentration as low as 2.8 mg/ml has also been demonstrated, 20 times less than a recommended dose. The maximum working distance from the sensor can be as large as 14.6~mm for higher concentrations. The sensor head has a maximum diameter of 10~mm which would allow it to be used for endoscopy, laparoscopy and interoperative surgery.</description>

      <title>AI analysis of medical images at scale as a health disparities probe: a feasibility demonstration using chest radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health disparities (differences in non-genetic conditions that influence health) can be associated with differences in burden of disease by groups within a population. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are domains such as health care access, dietary access, and economics frequently studied for potential association with health disparities. Evaluating SDOH-related phenotypes using routine medical images as data sources may enhance health disparities research. We developed a pipeline for using quantitative measures automatically extracted from medical images as inputs into health disparities index calculations. Our study focused on the use case of two SDOH demographic correlates (sex and race) and data extracted from chest radiographs of 1,571 unique patients. The likelihood of severe disease within the lung parenchyma from each image type, measured using an established deep learning model, was merged into a single numerical image-based phenotype for each patient. Patients were then separated into phenogroups by unsupervised clustering of the image-based phenotypes. The health rate for each phenogroup was defined as the median image-based phenotype for each SDOH used as inputs to four imaging-derived health disparities indices (iHDIs): one absolute measure (between-group variance) and three relative measures (index of disparity, Theil index, and mean log deviation). The iHDI measures demonstrated feasible values for each SDOH demographic correlate, showing potential for medical images to serve as a novel probe for health disparities. Large-scale AI analysis of medical images can serve as a probe for a novel data source for health disparities research.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Enhancement in Refractive Index Sensing via Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full-spectrum machine learning framework for refractive index sensing using simulated absorption spectra from meta-grating structures composed of titanium or silicon nanorods under TE and TM polarizations. Linear regression was applied to 80 principal components extracted from each spectrum, and model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, simulating real-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are predicted based on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by broadband intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the highest accuracy improvements: up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best single-feature model. In contrast, silicon-based structures, governed by narrow resonances, showed more modest gains due to spectral nonlinearity that limits the effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even the best single-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not visual selection, highlighting the value of automated feature preselection. These findings demonstrate that spectral shape plays a key role in modeling performance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are especially effective for intensity-modulated index sensors.</description>

      <title>Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, an automated treatment planning framework that integrates radiation oncology knowledge with the reasoning capabilities of large multi-modal models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI.
  Approach: Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical requirements and a few (3 in our experiments) approved clinical plans with their optimization settings, enabling GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan system is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an application programming interface (API). For a given patient, GPT-RadPlan acts as both plan evaluator and planner, first assessing dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs), and then providing textual feedback on how to improve the plan to match the physician's requirements. In this manner, GPT-RadPlan iteratively refines the plan by adjusting planning parameters, such as weights and dose objectives, based on its suggestions.
  Main results: The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased across 17 prostate cancer and 13 head and neck cancer VMAT plans with prescribed doses of 70.2 Gy and 72 Gy, respectively, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans produced by human experts. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and reducing organ-at-risk doses by 5 Gy on average (15 percent for prostate and 10-15 percent for head and neck).</description>

      <title>Quantification of Multi-Compartment Flow with Spectral Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Estimation of multi-compartment intravoxel flow in fD in ml/100g/min with multi-b-value diffusion weighted imaging and a multi-Gaussian model in the kidneys. Theory and Methods: A multi-Gaussian model of intravoxel flow using water transport time to quantify fD is presented and simulated. Multi-compartment anisotropic DWI signal is simulated analyzed with (1) a rigid bi-exponential, (2) a rigid tri-exponential, and (3) diffusion spectrum imaging model of intravoxel incoherent motion (spectral diffusion). The application is demonstrated in a two-center study of 54 kidney allografts with 9 b-value advanced DWI that were split by function (CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR&lt;45ml/min/1.73m2) and fibrosis (Banff 2017 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score 0-6). Results: Spectral diffusion demonstrated strong correlation to truth for simulated three-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=1.08x+0.1, R2=0.71) and two-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=0.91x+0.6, R2=0.74), outperforming rigid models in cases of variable compartment number. Use of a fixed regularization parameter set to {\lambda}=0.1 increased computation up to 208-fold and agreed with voxel-wise cross-validated regularization (concordance correlation coefficient=0.99). Spectral diffusion of renal allografts showed significant increase in tissue parenchyma compartment fD (f-stat=3.86, p=0.02). Tubular fD was significantly decreased in allografts with impaired function (Mann-Whitney Utest t-stat=-2.14, p=0.04). Conclusions: Quantitative multi-compartment intravoxel flow can be estimated in ml/100g/min with fD from multi-Gaussian diffusion, even with moderate anisotropy such as in kidneys. The use of spectral diffusion with a multi-Gaussian model and a fixed regularization parameter shows promise in organs such as the kidney with variable numbers of physiologic compartments.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about annihilation photon polarization is unavailable. Here, we present a PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, where annihilation photons primarily interact via the Compton effect, providing information about both photon polarization and propagation direction. Using this plastic-based PET, we determined the distribution of the relative angle between polarization planes of photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum-entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and para-positronium annihilations are maximally entangled. Our result indicates that the degree of entanglement depends on the annihilation mechanism in matter, opening new avenues for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a diagnostic indicator.</description>
