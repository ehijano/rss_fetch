      <title>Disentangling the Light Curve of a VIM: A Case Study Using NEOWISE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data collected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) and its follow-up Near Earth Object (NEO) mission (NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) represent a treasure trove for variability studies. However, the angular resolution imposed by the primary mirror implies that close double stars are often unresolved. Then, variability of one or both stars leads to motion of the image centroid along the connecting line. Such an object is known as a "variability-induced mover" (VIM). Knowledge of the angular separation, derived from higher-resolution imaging which resolves both components, allows disentangling of the joint light curve into individual ones. This is illustrated by the case of SPICY 1474 which featured an outburst several years ago. Removal of the contribution of the nearby companion, which led to a dilution of the burst strength, revealed that it was ~0.5 mag brighter than in the joint light curve. A comparison with light curves from unTimely suggests that utilizing the photocenter shift may lead to more reliable results.</description>

      <title>The Sunrise Ultraviolet Spectropolarimeter and Imager: Instrument description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third science flight of the balloon-borne solar observatory Sunrise carries three entirely new post-focus science instruments with spectropolarimetric capabilities, concurrently covering an extended spectral range from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Sampling a larger height range, from the low photosphere to the chromosphere, with the sub-arcsecond resolution provided by the 1-m Sunrise telescope, is key in understanding critical small-scale phenomena which energetically couple different layers of the solar atmosphere. The Sunrise Ultraviolet Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) operates between 309 nm and 417 nm. A key feature of SUSI is its capability to record up to several hundred spectral lines simultaneously without the harmful effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The rich SUSI spectra can be exploited in terms of many-line inversions. Another important innovation of the instrument is the synchronized 2D context imaging which allows to numerically correct the spectrograph scans for residual optical aberrations. In this work we describe the main design aspects of SUSI, the instrument characterization and testing, and finally its operation, expected performance and data products.</description>

      <title>On Soft Clustering For Correlation Estimators: Model Uncertainty, Differentiability, and Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properly estimating correlations between objects at different spatial scales necessitates $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ distance calculations. For this reason, most widely adopted packages for estimating correlations use clustering algorithms to approximate local trends. However, methods for quantifying the error introduced by this clustering have been understudied. In response, we present an algorithm for estimating correlations that is probabilistic in the way that it clusters objects, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty caused by clustering simply through model inference. These soft clustering assignments enable correlation estimators that are theoretically differentiable with respect to their input catalogs. Thus, we also build a theoretical framework for differentiable correlation functions and describe their utility in comparison to existing surrogate models. Notably, we find that repeated normalization and distance function calls slow gradient calculations and that sparse Jacobians destabilize precision, pointing towards either approximate or surrogate methods as a necessary solution to exact gradients from correlation functions. To that end, we close with a discussion of surrogate models as proxies for correlation functions. We provide an example that demonstrates the efficacy of surrogate models to enable gradient-based optimization of astrophysical model parameters, successfully minimizing a correlation function output. Our numerical experiments cover science cases across cosmology, from point spread function (PSF) modeling efforts to gravitational simulations to galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA).</description>

      <title>The UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Large Director's Discretionary Program with Hubble. I. Goals, Design, and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation Precision with Geocentric Gravitational Wave Interferometers: Monochromatic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Fisher information matrix study of the parameter estimation precision achievable by a class of future space-based, "mid-band", gravitational wave (GW) interferometers observing monochromatic signals. The mid-band is the frequency region between that accessible by LISA and ground-based interferometers. We analyze monochromatic signals from TianQin, gLISA, and gLISA$_d$, a descoped gLISA which has acceleration noise three orders of magnitude worse than gLISA. We find that all three missions achieve their best angular source reconstruction precision in the higher part of their accessible frequency band, with an error box better than $10^{-10}$ sr in the frequency band [$10^{-1},10$] Hz when observing a monochromatic GW signal of amplitude $h_0=10^{-21}$ that is incoming from a given direction. In terms of their reconstructed frequencies and amplitudes, TianQin achieves its best precision values in both quantities in the frequency band [$10^{-2}, 4\times 10^{-1}$] Hz, with a frequency precision $\sigma_{f_{gw}}=2\times 10^{-11}$ Hz and an amplitude precision $\sigma_{h_0}=2\times 10^{-24}$. gLISA matches these precisions in a frequency band slightly higher than that of TianQin, [$3\times 10^{-2},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its smaller arm length. gLISA$_d$, on the other hand, matches the performance of gLISA only over the narrower frequency region, [$7\times 10^{-1},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its higher acceleration noise at lower frequencies. The angular, frequency, and amplitude precisions as functions of the source sky location are derived assuming an average SNR of 10 at selected GW frequencies within TianQin and gLISA's bands. The same is done for gLISA$_d$ using amplitudes yielding an SNR of 10 for gLISA. We find that, for any given source location, all three missions display a marked precision improvement in the three reconstructed parameters at higher GW frequencies.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-Based Detection of Anomalous Stokes V Spectra in the Flare-Producing Active Region 13663 Using Hinode/SP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting unusual signals in observational solar spectra is crucial for understanding the features associated with impactful solar events, such as solar flares. However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges, particularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process large volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these limitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V spectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an autoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly detection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within spectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May 5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly complex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in magnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy storage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are highly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in magnetogram images using current manual methods.</description>

      <title>Tuning into spatial frequency space: Satellite and space debris detection in the ZTF alert stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant challenge in the study of transient astrophysical phenomena is the identification of bogus events, among which human-made satellites and debris in Earth orbit remain major contaminants. Existing pipelines effectively identify satellite trails but can miss more complex signatures, such as collections of satellite glints. In the Rubin Observatory era, the scale of operations will increase tenfold compared to its precursor, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), requiring improvements in classification purity, data compression for informative alerts, and pipeline speed.
  We explore the use of the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on difference images as a tool to enhance machine learning models for satellite detection. Using the ALeRCE single-stamp classifier as a baseline, we adapt its architecture to incorporate a cutout of the FFT of the difference image alongside the standard ZTF image triplet (science, reference, and difference stamps). We evaluate several stamp sizes and resolutions, focusing on regimes where data compression is critical due to alert size limits and real-time constraints.
  Incorporating the FFT significantly improves satellite classification, especially in the smallest field-of-view model (16 arcsec), where accuracy increases from 72.0\pm2.9% to 87.8\pm1.3%. This demonstrates the FFT's value in compressing and capturing extended satellite features. However, the FFT alone does not match the full-context performance of the 63 arcsec (95.9\pm1.3%) or multiscale (90.6\pm0.8%) models, highlighting the complementary role of spatial context. We show how FFTs can be leveraged to cull satellite and debris signatures from alert streams in current and future time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing wider hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This choice is particularly relevant for use cases in astrophysics and engineering -- specifically those in which particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales -- where bespoke choices of unequal particle masses in the initial conditions cannot easily be used to address emergent and evolving density discontinuities. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art SWIFT code and is designed with computational efficiency also in mind, meaning that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without prohibitive cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>
