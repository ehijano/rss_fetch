      <title>Restricted Fubini Rankings and Restricted Unit Interval Parking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three natural types of restrictions on Fubini rankings and unit interval parking functions, which are motivated by their correspondence with ordered set partitions. For each restriction type, we define the corresponding subset of Fubini rankings and unit interval parking functions, establish enumerative results, and provide bijections between the restricted families. We also obtain exponential generating functions and combinatorial interpretations, including connections with exceedances in permutations and with the absence of cyclical adjacencies in set partitions.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial interpretation for certain plethysm and Kronecker coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit positive combinatorial interpretations for the plethysm coefficients $\langle s_\mu[s_\nu], s_\lambda\rangle$, when $\lambda$ has at most two rows, as counting certain marked trees. In the special case $\mu=(n)$, this also yields a combinatorial interpretation for the corresponding rectangular Kronecker coefficient $g(\lambda, (n^k), (n^k))$. While it is easy to express these quantities as differences of counting problems in the complexity class $\mathrm{FP}$, putting the problem in $\#\mathrm{P}$, our interpretations give a positive counting formula over explicit marked trees.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dot-product graphs in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. We prove that if the size of the product of two adjacent sets is large enough, then the set of dot-product graphs has positive density. Our method is based on finite field Fourier analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>On a Compact Generalization of Association Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of compact association schemes, which serves as a compact analogue of classical (finite) association schemes. Our definition is formulated in a way that closely parallels the finite case, naturally admits a Bose--Mesner algebra, and includes the compact strong continuous association schemes introduced by Voit [J. Aust. Math. (2019)] within the framework of hypergroups. This approach provides a new perspective that bridges the theory of association schemes with harmonic analysis on compact homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Monadic Second-Order Logic of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutations can be viewed as pairs of linear orders, or more formally as models over a signature consisting of two binary relation symbols. This approach was adopted by Albert, Bouvel and F\'eray, who studied the expressibility of first-order logic in this setting. We focus our attention on monadic second-order logic.
  Our results go in two directions. First, we investigate the expressive power of monadic second-order logic. We exhibit natural properties of permutations that can be expressed in monadic second-order logic but not in first-order logic. Additionally, we show that the property of having a fixed point is inexpressible even in monadic second-order logic.
  Secondly, we focus on the complexity of monadic second-order model checking. We show that there is an algorithm deciding if a permutation $\pi$ satisfies a given monadic second-order sentence $\varphi$ in time $f(|\varphi|, \operatorname{tw}(\pi)) \cdot n$ for some computable function $f$ where $n = |\pi|$ and $\operatorname{tw}(\pi)$ is the tree-width of $\pi$. On the other hand, we prove that the problem remains hard even when we restrict the permutation $\pi$ to a fixed hereditary class $\mathcal{C}$ with mild assumptions on $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Circuits and Neural Networks for Regular Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size $O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local version of the star-mesh transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study the {\em asymptotic popularity}, that is, the limit probability to find a given consecutive pattern at a random position in a random permutation in the eighteen classes of permutations avoiding at least two length 3 consecutive patterns. We show that for ten classes, this popularity can be readily deduced from the structure of permutations. By combining analytical and bijective approaches, we study in details two more involved cases. The problem remains open for five classes.</description>

      <title>New upper bounds for binary linear covering codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The length function $\ell_2(r,R)$ is the smallest length of a binary linear code with codimension (redundancy) $r$ and covering radius $R$. We obtain the following new upper bounds on $\ell_2(r,R)$, which yield a decrease $\Delta(r,R)$ compared to the best previously known upper bounds: \begin{align*} &amp;R=2,\,r=2t,\,r=18,20,\T{ and }r\ge28,\,\ell_2(r,2)\le26\cdot2^{r/2-4}-1;\,\Delta(r,2)=2^{r/2-4}.\\ &amp;R=3,\,r=3t-1,\,r=26\T{ and }r\ge44,\,\ell_2(r,3)\le819\cdot2^{(r-26)/3}-1;\,\Delta(r,3)=2^{(r-23)/3}.\\ &amp;R=4,\,r=4t,\,r=40\T{ and }r\ge68,\,\ell_2(r,4)\le2943\cdot2^{r/4-10}-1;\,\Delta(r,4)=2^{r/4-10}-1. \end{align*} To obtain these bounds we construct new infinite code families, using distinct versions of the $q^m$-concatenating constructions of covering codes; some of these versions are proposed in this paper. We also introduce new useful partitions of column sets of parity check matrices of some codes. The asymptotic covering densities $\overline{\mu}(2)\thickapprox1.3203$, $\overline{\mu}(3)\thickapprox1.3643$, $\overline{\mu}(4)\thickapprox2.8428$, provided by the codes of the new families, are smaller than the known ones.</description>

      <title>A geometric and generating function approach to plethysm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plethysm coefficients $\mathsf{a}_{\mu[\nu]}^\lambda$ are the structure coefficients of the plethysm of Schur functions $s_\mu[s_\nu] = \sum_{\lambda} \mathsf{a}_{\mu[\nu]}^\lambda s_\lambda$. We study a bivariate generating function of plethysm coefficients when $\lambda$ has bounded length. We show that this generating function is rational. A key step is MacMahon's combinatory analysis. When the bound on the length is $2$ we give an explicit geometric algorithm to compute it using $q$-Ehrhart theory. We give evidence that the generating function is the quantum Ehrhart series of a union of half-open polytopes and show that it satisfies a reciprocity theorem reminiscent of Ehrhart reciprocity. Furthermore, we give a set of linear recursions that completely describe the $\mathrm{SL}_2$-plethysm coefficients.</description>

      <title>Tensor rank and dimension expanders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound on the rank of tensors constructed from families of linear maps that `expand' the dimension of every subspace. Such families, called {\em dimension expanders} have been studied for many years with several known explicit constructions. Using these constructions we show that one can construct an explicit $[D]\times [n] \times [n]$-tensor with rank at least $(2 - \epsilon)n$, with $D$ a constant depending on $\epsilon$. Our results extend to border rank over the real or complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bounds for the maximum order of an induced acyclic subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the cardinality of a maximum induced acyclic vertex set in a digraph is NP-hard. Since finding an exact solution is computationally difficult, a fruitful approach is to establish high-quality lower bounds that are efficiently computable. We build on the Akbari--Ghodrati--Jabalameli--Saghafian (AGJS) bound for digraphs by adapting refinement techniques used by (a) Selkow and Harant--Mohr and (b) Angel--Campigotto--Laforest in their respective improvements of the Caro--Wei bound for undirected graphs. First, inspired by (a), we prove a neighborhood-based refinement of the AGJS bound that incorporates local degree data of each vertex. Second, inspired by (b), we compute the variance of the size of a feedback vertex set returned by a randomized algorithm. This result, combined with the Bhatia--Davis inequality, yields a tighter lower bound than the AGJS bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Lefschetz module is a module over a graded algebra $A$ that satisfies analogues of Poincar\'{e} duality, the Hard Lefschetz property, and the Hodge--Riemann relations with respect to an open convex cone $\mathscr{K}$ in the degree one part of $A$. We analyze its decomposition into indecomposable modules over subrings of $A$ that are generated by elements in the closure of $\mathscr{K}$, establishing structural results that parallel the decomposition theorem for morphisms of complex projective varieties. We use our theorems to recover key statements in combinatorial Hodge theory and illuminate the Hodge-theoretic aspects of the decomposition theorem in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>About subspaces the most deviating from the coordinate ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking the largest principal angle as the distance function between same dimensional nontrivial linear subspaces in $\mathds{R}^n$, we describe the class of subspaces deviating from all the coordinate ones by at least $\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. This study compliments and is motivated by the long-standing hypothesis put forward in \cite{GTZ1997} and essentially stating that so-defined distance to the closest coordinate subspace cannot exceed $\arccos(1 / \sqrt{n})$. In this context, the subspaces presented here claim to be the extremal ones.
  Realized as the star spaces of all nontrivial 2-connected series-parallel graphs with certain edge weights and arbitrary edge directions, the given subspaces may be of interest beyond numerical linear algebra within which the original problem was formulated.</description>

      <title>Every group is represented by an incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between finite groups and incidence geometries through their automorphism structures. Building upon classical results on the realizability of groups as automorphism groups of graphs, we develop a general framework to represent pairs of finite groups $(G, H)$, where $H \trianglelefteq G$, as pairs of correlation--automorphism groups of suitable incidence geometries. Specifically, we prove that for every such pair $(G, H)$, there exists an incidence geometry $\Gamma$ satisfying that the pair $(\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma), \operatorname{Aut}_I(\Gamma))$ of correlation--automorphism groups of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $(G, H)$. Our construction proceeds in two main steps: first, we realize $(G, H)$ as the correlation and automorphism groups of an incidence system; then, we refine this system into a genuine incidence geometry preserving the same pair of groups. We also provide explicit examples, including a family of geometries realizing $(S_n, A_n)$ for all $n \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Hermite-Jensen limits and $d$ log-concavity of $q$-multinomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1878, Sylvester proved Cayley's Conjecture that the coefficients of the Gaussian $q$-binomial coefficients are unimodal. In 1990, O'Hara famously discovered a constructive combinatorial proof, and in 2013, Pak and Panova proved the stronger property of strict unimodality for sufficiently large parameters. We move from unimodality to log-concavity and higher degree $ d$ log-concavity, known as Tur\'an inequalities. Although $q$-binomial coefficients are not always log- or degree $d$ log-concave, it's natural to ask to what extent these inequalities hold. In infinite families with limiting aspect ratio bounded away from zero and one, we prove that these stronger inequalities hold uniformly, for each $C&gt;0,$ on the central window $|m-\mu|&lt; C\sigma,$ where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the normalized distribution. More generally, we obtain the same conclusions for $q$-multinomial coefficients. These results stem from the asymptotic behavior of normalized Jensen polynomials, which are approximated by Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Bivariate Chromatic Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, introduced in this article, counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph with $\lambda$ colors such that adjacent vertices either receive distinct colors from a set of $\lambda$ colors, or the same color from a distinguished subset of $\lambda-\mu$ colors, up to a group of symmetries. This new graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the orbital chromatic polynomial due to Cameron and Kayibi (2007) and the bivariate chromatic polynomial due to Dohmen, P\"onitz, and Tittmann (2003). We discuss fundamental properties, and provide expansions of this new polynomial for various families of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. Some of these expansions are even new for the orbital chromatic polynomial. In addition to these results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a ``Fermat-like'' congruence for Lucas numbers. Finally, we outline several open problems related to the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a parametrization of the conjugates of Christoffel words based on the integer Ostrowski numeration system. We use it to give a precise description of the borders (prefixes which are also suffixes) of the conjugates of Christoffel words and to revisit the notion of Sturmian graph introduced by Epifanio et al.</description>

      <title>Flip colouring of graphs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give results concerning two problems on the recently introduced \textit{flip colourings of graphs}. For positive integers $b, r$ with $b &lt; r$, we say that a $b + r$ regular graph is a $(b,r)$-\textit{flip graph} if there exists a red/blue edge colouring such that the red degree of every vertex is $r$, the blue degree of every vertex is $b$, yet in the closed neighbourhood of every vertex there are more blue edges than red edges.
  We prove that for integers $b, r$ with $4 \leq b &lt; r &lt; b + 2 \left\lfloor\frac{b+2}{6}\right\rfloor^2$, small constructions of $(b,r)$-flip graphs on $\Theta(b+r)$ vertices are possible. Furthermore, we prove that there exist $k$-flip sequences $(a_1, \dots, a_k)$ where $k &gt; 4$, such that $a_k$ can be arbitrarily large whilst $a_i$ is constant for $1 \leq i &lt; \frac{k}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Parity of the coefficients of certain eta-quotients, III: two special classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue a series of papers studying the parity of families of eta-quotients, which provide implications for the parity of the partition function as well as an overarching conjecture on related $q$-series. The present article focuses on two classes. One consists of eta-quotients of the form $f_t^3/f_1$, a distinguished case of Andrews' singular overpartitions that has recently attracted attention among researchers. In addition, we investigate the parity of certain pure eta-powers $f_1^t$, appending new results to known density theorems.</description>

      <title>Condorcet cycle elections with influential voting blocs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Condorcet cycle election is an election (often called a Social Welfare Function, or SWF) between three candidates, where each voter ranks the three candidates according to a fixed cyclic order. Maskin showed that if such a SWF obeys the MIIA condition, and respects the complete anonymity of each voter, then it must be a Borda election, where each voter assigns two points to their preferred candidate, one to their second preference and none to their least preferred candidate.
  We introduce a relaxed anonymity condition called ``transitive anonymity'', whereby a group $G$ acting transitively on the set of voters $V$ maintains the outcome of the SWF. Elections across multiple constituencies of equal size are common examples of elections with transitive anonymity but without full anonymity. First, we demonstrate that under this relaxed anonymity condition, non-Borda elections do exist. On the other hand, by modifying Kalai's proof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which employs methods from the analysis of Boolean functions, we show that this can only occur when the number of voters is not a multiple of three, and we demonstrate that even these non-Borda elections are very close to being Borda.</description>

      <title>A charge monomial basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring using the catabolizability type of standard Young tableaux and the charge statistic. This basis turns out to be equal to the descent basis defined in Carlsson-Chou (2024+). Our new construction connects the combinatorics of the basis with the well-known combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$, due to Lascoux, which expresses the polynomials as a sum over standard tableaux that satisfy a catabolizability condition. In addition, we prove that identifying a basis for the antisymmetric part of $R_{\mu}$ with respect to a Young subgroup $S_\gamma$ is equivalent to finding pairs of standard tableaux that satisfy conditions regarding catabolizability and descents. This gives an elementary proof of the fact that the graded Frobenius character of $R_{\mu}$ is given by the catabolizability formula for $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$.</description>

      <title>Good election rules with more than three candidates are Borda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrow proved that for three or more candidates, the IIA condition is enough to forbid all non-dictatorial election rules (or Social Welfare Functions). Maskin introduced the weaker MIIA condition, which permits the ``Borda'' election rules where each voter assigns points linearly to each candidate according to their order of preference. However, in previous work we demonstrated that there exist Social Welfare Functions between three candidates and satisfying the MIIA condition which are far from being Borda rules.
  We demonstrate that this phenomenon is unique to the case of three candidates. As soon as a fourth candidate is introduced, and indeed for any larger number of candidates, the only good election rules are the unweighted Borda rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalization of cooperative games to the case where a coalition can distribute the earned utility not only among its members but also to other players. In particular, we consider an example where coalitions are required to share their winnings with non-contributing players. For these generalized games, we also provide an analogue of Scarf's theorem. It turns out that in this generalization, the existence of a non-empty core is closely related to a homotopy invariant of covers defined by the cooperative game.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Tur\'an problems via graph gluing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, if we glue them by identifying a given pair of vertices $u \in V(H_1)$ and $v \in V(H_2)$, what is the extremal number of the resulting graph $H_1^u \odot H_2^v$? In this paper, we study this problem and show that interestingly it is equivalent to an old question of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits on the Zarankiewicz problem. When $H_1, H_2$ are copies of a same bipartite graph $H$ and $u, v$ come from a same part, we prove that $\operatorname{ex}(n, H_1^u \odot H_2^v) = \Theta \bigl( \operatorname{ex}(n, H) \bigr)$. As a corollary, we provide a short self-contained disproof of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, which was recently disproved by Janzer.</description>

      <title>When alcoved polytopes add</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are characterized by the property that all facet normal directions are parallel to the roots $e_i-e_j$. Unlike other prominent families of polytopes, like generalized permutahedra, alcoved polytopes are not closed under Minkowski sums. We nonetheless show that the Minkowski sum of a collection of alcoved polytopes is alcoved if and only if each pairwise sum is alcoved. This implies that the type fan of alcoved polytopes is determined by its two-dimensional cones. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of when the Minkowski sum of alcoved simplices is again alcoved via a graphical criterion on pairs of ordered set partitions. Our characterization reduces to checking conditions on restricted partitions of length at most six. In particular, we show how the Minkowski sum decompositions of the two most well-known families of alcoved polytopes, the associahedron and the cyclohedron, fit in our framework. Additionally, inspired by the physical construction of one-loop scattering amplitudes, we present a new infinite family of alcoved polytopes, called $\widehat{D}_n$ polytopes. We conclude by drawing a connection to matroidal blade arrangements and the Dressian.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative chromatic quasi-symmetric functions, Macdonald polynomials, and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As shown in our paper [JCTA 177 (2021), Paper No. 105305], the chromatic quasi-symmetric function of Shareshian-Wachs can be lifted to ${\bf WQSym}$, the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions in noncommuting variables. We investigate here its behaviour with respect to classical transformations of alphabets and propose a noncommutative analogue of Macdonald polynomials compatible with a noncommutative version of the Haglund-Wilson formula. We also introduce a multi-$t$ version of these noncommutative analogues. For rectangular partitions, their commutative images at $q=0$ appear to coincide with the multi-$t$ Hall-Littlewood functions introduced in [Lett. Math. Phys. 35 (1995), 359]. This leads us to conjecture that for rectangular partitions, multi-$t$ Macdonald polynomials are obtained as equivariant traces of certain Yang-Baxter elements of Hecke algebras. We also conjecture that all (ordinary) Macdonald polynomials can be obtained in this way. We conclude with some remarks relating various aspects of quasi-symmetric chromatic functions to calculations in Hecke algebras. In particular, we show that all modular relations are given by the product formula of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated union-closed conjecture is concerned with the cardinalities of various subsets of the Boolean $d$-cube. The cardinality of such a set is equivalent, up to a constant, to its measure under the uniform distribution, so we can pose more general conjectures by choosing a different probability distribution on the cube. In particular, for any sequence of probabilities $(p_i)_{i=1}^d$ we can consider the product of $d$ independent Bernoulli random variables, with success probabilities $p_i$. In this short note, we find a generalised form of Karpas' special case of the union-closed conjecture for families $\mathcal{F}$ with density at least half. We also generalise Knill's logarithmic lower bound.</description>

      <title>On likelihood of a Condorcet winner for uniformly random and independent voter preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20613v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of voting contest with $m$ voters and $n$ candidates, with each voter ranking the candidates in order of preference, without ties. A Condorcet winner is a candidate who gets more than $m/2$ votes in pairwise contest with every other candidate. An ``impartial culture'' setting is the case when each voter chooses his/her candidate preference list uniformly at random from all $n!$ preferences, and does it independently of all other voters. For impartial culture case, Robert May and Lisa Sauermann showed that when $m=2k-1$ is fixed ($k=2$ and $k&gt;2$ respectively), and $n$ grows indefinitely, the probability of a Condorcet winner is small, of order $n^{-(k-1)/k}$. We show if $m, n\to\infty$ and $m\gg n^4$, then for each fixed $\ell$ the probability of a Condercet winner is at most of order $n^{-\ell} + n^2/m^{1/2}$, thus converges to zero.</description>

Abstract: Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$ points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the configuration of the points?</description>

Abstract: Strongly regular graphs are highly symmetrical and can be described fully with just a few parameters yet the existence of many of them is still under the question. Due to this uncertainty, it is of immense interest to study their structure, in particular to obtain all the possible subgraphs of lower order. In this paper we study the family of strongly regular graphs with parameters $\lambda =1$ and $\mu =2$ and establish all their subgraphs of order six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few years, the slice-rank lemma of Tao has been applied successfully to many problems in extremal combinatorics. In this paper, first, we define a new notion of triangular tensors which generalizes that of triangular matrices (2-tensors), and prove a lemma similar to the slice-rank lemma for them. Then, applying the slice-rank framework with triangular matrices, we give new and shorter proofs for some well-known theorems on set-intersections like Frankl-Wilson and Snevily with modular constraints, and some of the more recent set-intersection results. We also improve Snevily with modular constraints in some special cases. Finally, using Snevily's theorem with some combinatorial lemmas, we give new bounds on some generalizations of the reverse odd-town problem.</description>

      <title>Linear recoloring diameter of degenerate chordal graphs and bounded treewidth graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $t$ an integer. The reconfiguration graph of $G$, denoted by $R_t(G)$, consists of all $t$-colorings of $G$ and two $t$-colorings are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. The $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is the diameter of $R_t(G)$. For a $d$-degenerate graph $G$, $R_t(G)$ is connected when $t \ge d+2$~(Dyer et al., 2006). Furthermore, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge 3(d+1)/2$~(Bousquet et al., 2022), and it is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+2$~(Bousquet and Perarnau, 2016). For a $d$-degenerate and chordal graph $G$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge d+2$~(Bonamy et al. 2014). If $G$ is a graph of treewidth at most $k$, then $G$ is also $k$-degenerate, and the previous results hold. Moreover, when $t \ge k+2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$~(Bonamy and Bousquet, 2013). When $k=2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is linear when $t \ge 5$~(Bartier, Bousquet and Heinrich, 2021) and the result is tight. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is $d$-degenerate and chordal, then the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+1$. Moreover, if the treewidth of $G$ is at most $k$, then the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2k+1$. This result is a generalization of the previous results on graphs of treewidth at most two.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ and log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Stanley's generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph to the chromatic symmetric function, we introduce the characteristic polynomial of a representation of the symmetric group, or more generally, of a symmetric function. When the representation arises from geometry, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial tend to form a log-concave sequence. To illustrate, we investigate explicit examples, including the $n$-fold products of the projective spaces, the GIT moduli spaces of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Hessenberg varieties. Our main focus lies on the cohomology of the moduli space of pointed rational curves, for which we prove asymptotic formulas of its characteristic polynomial and establish asymptotic log-concavity.</description>

      <title>Linear quotients, linear resolutions and the lcm-lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear resolutions and the stronger notion of linear quotients are important properties of monomial ideals. In this paper, we fully characterize linear quotients in terms of the lcm-lattice of monomial ideals. We also formulate an analogous characterization for monomial ideals with linear resolutions, making explicit a relationship that is implicit in the existing literature. These results complement characterizations of these two properties in terms of the Alexander dual of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex. In addition, we discuss applications to the case of edge ideals.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when parameterized by the solution size. On the other hand, we consider the family of zero forcing problems which form the parameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction over the Deletion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction problem in the case where the transmitted codeword is chosen from $\{0,1\}^n$ and the channel can delete up to $t$ symbols from the transmitted codeword. We determine the minimum number of channel outputs (assuming that they are distinct) required to reconstruct a list of size $\ell-1$ of candidate sequences, one of which corresponds to the original transmitted sequence. More specifically, we determine the maximum possible size of the intersection of $\ell \geq 3$ deletion balls of radius $t$ centered at $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{\ell}$, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ for all $i \in \{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ and $x_i \neq x_j$ for $i \neq j$, with $n \geq t+ \ell-1$ and $t \geq 1$.</description>
