      <title>Chow K\"unneth decomposition for \'etale motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article we define an integral analogue of Chow-K\"unneth decomposition for \'etale motives. By using families of conservative functors we are able to establish a decomposition of the \'etale motive of commutative group schemes over a base and we relate to an integral \'etale Chow-K\"unneth decomposition of abelian varieties. For a projective variety $X$ of dimension $d$ over an algebraically closed field, we construct integral sub-motives $h^1_{\text{\'et}}(X)$ and $h^{2d-1}_{\text{\'et}}(X)$ of the motive $h_{\text{\'et}}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Frobenius rigidity in $\mathbb A^1$-homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homotopy fixed points under the Frobenius endomorphism on the stable $\mathbb A^1$-homotopy category of schemes in characteristic p&gt;0 and prove a rigidity result for cellular objects in these categories after inverting p. As a consequence we determine the analogous fixed points on the K-theory of algebraically closed fields in positive characteristic. We also prove a rigidity result for the homotopy fixed points of the partial Frobenius pullback on motivic cohomology groups in weights at most 1.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Measures of Random Plane Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the expected area of the amoeba of a complex plane curve of degree $d$ is less than $\displaystyle{3\ln(d)^2/2+9\ln(d)+9}$ and once rescaled by $\ln(d)^2$, is asymptotically bounded from below by $3/4$. In order to get this lower bound, given disjoint isometric embeddings of a bidisc of size $1/\sqrt{d}$ in the complex projective plane, we lower estimate the probability that one of them is a submanifold chart of a complex plane curve. It exponentially converges to one as the number of bidiscs grow to $+\infty$.</description>

      <title>Configurations in the Euclidean space related to the 3D genome reconstruction problem from partially phased data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A motivation for studying the following problems comes from applications to Biology; see \cite{cifuentes20233d}. In the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf{E}}^3$, fix six pairwise distinct points \begin{equation*} \label{eqA} \begin{array}{ccc} A=(a_1,a_2,a_3), &amp; B=(b_1,b_2,b_3), &amp; C=(c_1,c_2,c_3), \\ D=(d_1,d_2,d_3), &amp; E=(e_1,e_2,e_3), &amp; F=(f_1,f_2,f_3) \end{array} \end{equation*} together with two further points $X^*=(x_1^*,x_2^*,x_3^*)$ and $Y^*=(y_1^*,y_2^*,y_3^*)$ in $\mathbf{E}^3$. We aim to show that System $(*)$ consisting of the following six equations in the unknowns $X=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and $Y=(y_1,y_2,y_3)$ \begin{equation} \label{egy} \frac{1}{\|X-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y-T\|^2}=\frac{1}{\|X^*-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y^*-T\|^2}, \quad T\in\{A,B,\ldots,F\}. \end{equation} has only finitely many solutions provided that both of the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) no four of the fixed points $A,B,C,D,E,F$ are coplanar; (ii) no four of the six spheres of center $T$ and radius $1/\sqrt{k_T}$ with \begin{equation} \label{kxy} k_T=\frac{1}{\|X^*-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y^*-T\|^2} \end{equation} share a common point in ${\bf{E}}^3$. Furthermore, we exhibit configurations $ABCDEFX^*Y^*$, showing that (i) is also necessary. This result is an improvement on \cite[Theorem 1]{cifuentes20233d} where the finiteness of solutions of System $(*)$ is only ensured for sufficiently generic choices of the points $A,B,\ldots,F,X^*,Y^*.$ We also show if System $(*)$ has finitely many solutions and System $(*)$ extended with $T\in\{A,B,\ldots,F,G\}$ has some solutions other than $(X^*,Y^*)$ and $(Y^*,X^*)$ then $G$ lies on an explicitly given affine variety $W\subsetneqq \mathbb{R}^3$ only depending on $\{A,B,\ldots,F\}$. This result proves the \cite[Conjecture 1]{cifuentes20233d}.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Higgs bundles and the Toledo invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex semisimple Lie group and $\mathfrak g$ its Lie algebra. In this paper, we study a special class of cyclic Higgs bundles constructed from a $\mathbb Z$-grading $\mathfrak g = \bigoplus_{j=1-m}^{m-1}\mathfrak g_j$ by using the natural representation $G_0 \to GL(\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$, where $G_0 \le G$ is the connected subgroup corresponding to $\mathfrak g_0$. The resulting Higgs pairs include $G^{\mathbb R}$-Higgs bundles for $G^{\mathbb R} \le G$ a real form of Hermitian type (in the case $m=2$) and fixed points of the ${\mathbb C}^*$-action on $G$-Higgs bundles (in the case where the Higgs field vanishes along $\mathfrak g_{1-m}$). In both of these situations a topological invariant with interesting properties, known as the Toledo invariant, has been defined and studied in the literature. This paper generalises its definition and properties to the case of arbitrary $(G_0,\mathfrak g_1 \oplus \mathfrak g_{1-m})$-Higgs pairs, which give rise to families of cyclic Higgs bundles. The results are applied to the example with $m=3$ that arises from the theory of quaternion-K\"ahler symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Twisted restricted conformal blocks of vertex operator algebras II: twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbifold curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbifold curves and establish the isomorphism between the space of twisted restricted conformal blocks and the space of twisted conformal blocks. In the specific example of a twisted projective line, isomorphisms between the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) conformal block and the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) correlation functions are established. This leads to a more conceptual proof of the $g$-twisted fusion rule theorem in vertex operator algebra theory. Furthermore, by introducing a geometric generalization of Zhu's algebra and its modules, we obtain a general version of the twisted fusion rule theorem.</description>

      <title>The Honest Embedding Dimension of a Numerical Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attached to a singular analytic curve germ in $d$-space is a numerical semigroup: a subset $S$ of the non-negative integers which is closed under addition and whose complement isfinite. Conversely, associated to any numerical semigroup $S$ is a canonical mononial curve in $e$-space where $e$ is the number of minimal generators of the semigroup. It may happen that $d &lt; e = e(S)$ where $S$ is the semigroup of the curve in $d$-space. Define the minimal (or `honest') embedding of a numerical semigroup to be the smallest $d$ such that $S$ is realized by a curve in $d$-space. Problem: characterize the numerical semigroups having minimal embedding dimension $d$. The answer is known for the case $d=2$ of planar curves and reviewed in an Appendix to this paper. The case $d =3$ of the problem is open. Our main result is a characterization of the multiplicity $4$ numerical semigroups whose minimal embedding dimension is $3$. See figure 1. The motivation for this work came from thinking about Legendrian curve singularities.</description>

      <title>Extremal decompositions of tropical varieties and relations with rigidity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremality and irreducibility constitute fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly within tropical geometry. While extremal decomposition is typically computationally hard, this article presents a fast algorithm for identifying the extremal decomposition of tropical varieties with rational balanced weightings. Additionally, we explore connections and applications related to rigidity theory. In particular, we prove that a tropical hypersurface is extremal if and only if it has a unique reciprocal diagram up to homothety.</description>

      <title>Moduli of sheaves on fourfolds as derived Lagrangian intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any $(-2)$-shifted symplectic derived scheme $\textbf{X}$ (of finite type over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) is locally equivalent to the derived intersection of two Lagrangian morphisms to a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived scheme which is the $(-1)$-shifted cotangent stack of a smooth classical scheme. This leads to the possibility of the following viewpoint that is, at least to us, new: any $n$-shifted symplectic derived scheme can be obtained, locally, by repeated derived Lagrangian intersections in a smooth classical scheme.
  We also give a separate proof of our main result in the case where the local Darboux atlas cdga for $\textbf{X}$ has an even number of generators in degree $(-1)$; in this case we strengthen the result by showing that $\textbf{X}$ is in fact locally equivalent to the derived critical locus of a shifted function, which we've been told is a folklore result in the field. We indicate the implications of this for derived moduli stacks of sheaves on Calabi-Yau fourfolds by spelling out the case when the fourfold is $\mathbb{C}^4$.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of simple sheaves on singular K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mukai proved that the moduli space of simple sheaves on a smooth projective K3 surface is symplectic, and in \cite{FM2} we gave two constructions allowing one to construct new locally closed Lagrangian/isotropic subspaces of the moduli from old ones. In this paper, we extend both Mukai's result and our construction to reduced projective K3 surfaces; for the former we need to restrict our attention to perfect sheaves. There are two key points where we cannot get a straightforward generalization. In each, we need to prove that a certain differential form on the moduli space of simple, perfect sheaves vanishes, and we introduce a smoothability condition to complete the proof.</description>

      <title>A Strong Version of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz for slice regular polynomials in several quaternionic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16784v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a strong version of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz in the ring $\mathbb H[q_1,\ldots,q_n]$ of slice regular polynomials in several quaternionic variables. Our proof deeply depends on a detailed analysis of the common zeros of slice regular polynomials which belong to an ideal in $\mathbb H[q_1,\ldots,q_n]$. This study motivates the introduction of a new notion of algebraic set in the quaternionic setting, which allows us to define a Zariski-type topology on $\mathbb H^n$.</description>

      <title>Representations of Kronecker quivers and Steiner bundles on Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{k}$ be an algebraically closed field. Connections between representations of the generalized Kronecker quivers $K_r$ and vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$ have been known for quite some time. This article is concerned with a particular aspect of this correspondence, involving more generally Steiner bundles on Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_d(\mathbb{k}^r)$ and certain full subcategories $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$ of relative projective $K_r$-representations. Building on a categorical equivalence first explicitly established by Jardim and Prata, we employ representation-theoretic techniques provided by Auslander-Reiten theory and reflection functors to organize indecomposable Steiner bundles in a manner that facilitates the study of bundles enjoying certain properties such as uniformity and homogeneity. Conversely, computational results on Steiner bundles motivate investigations in $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$, which elicit the conceptual sources of some recent work on the subject.
  From a purely representation-theoretic vantage point, our paper initiates the investigation of certain full subcategories of the, for $r\!\ge\!3$, wild category of $K_r$-representations. These may be characterized as being right Hom-orthogonal to certain algebraic families of elementary test modules.</description>

      <title>The distribution of $a$-numbers of hyperelliptic curves in characteristic three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new approach to counting the proportion of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with a given $a$-number. In characteristic three this method gives exact probabilities for curves of the form $Y^2=f(X)$ with $f(X)\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ monic and cubefree, probabilities that match the data presented by Cais et al. in previous work. These results are sufficient to derive precise estimates (in terms of $q$) for these probabilities when restricting to squarefree $f$. As a consequence, for positive integers $a$ and $g$ we show that the nonempty strata of the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ consisting of those curves with $a$-number $a$ are of codimension $2a-1$. This contrasts with the analogous result for the moduli space of abelian varieties in which the codimensions of the strata are $a(a+1)/2$. Finally, our results allow for an alternative heuristic conjecture to that of Cais et al.; one that matches the available data.</description>

      <title>Tropical twisted Hurwitz numbers for elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurwitz numbers enumerate branched morphisms between Riemann surfaces. For a fixed elliptic target, Hurwitz numbers are intimately related to mirror symmetry following work of Dijkgraaf. In recent work of Chapuy and Dolega a new variant of Hurwitz numbers with fixed genus $0$ target was introduced that includes maps between between non-orientiable surfaces. These numbers are called $b$-Hurwitz numbers and are polynomials in a parameter $b$ which measures the non-orientability of the involved maps. An interpretation in terms of factorisations of $b$-Hurwitz numbers for $b=1$, so-called twisted Hurwitz numbers, was found in work of Burman and Fesler. In previous work, the authors derived a tropical geometry interpretation of these numbers. In this paper, we introduce a natural generalisation of twisted Hurwitz numbers with elliptic targets within the framework of symmetric groups. We derive a tropical interpretation of these invariants, relate them to Feynman integrals and derive an expression as a matrix element of an operator in the bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given graph whose edges are labeled with general real numbers, we consider the set of functions from the vertex set into the Euclidean plane such that the distance between the images of neighbouring vertices is equal to the corresponding edge label. This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially.</description>

      <title>Semi-Local Exotic Lagrangian Tori in Dimension Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exotic Lagrangian tori in dimension four. In certain Stein domains $B_{dpq}$ (which naturally appear in almost toric fibrations) we find $d+1$ families of monotone Lagrangian tori which are mutually distinct, up to symplectomorphisms. We prove that these remain distinct under embeddings of $B_{dpq}$ into geometrically bounded symplectic four-manifolds. We show that there are infinitely many different such embeddings when $X$ is compact and (almost) toric and hence conclude that $X$ contains arbitrarily many Lagrangian tori which are distinct up to symplectomorphisms of $X$. In dimension four arbitrarily many different Lagrangian tori were previously known only in del Pezzo surfaces.
  Neither the embedded tori, nor the ambient space $X$ needs to be monotone for our methods to work.</description>

      <title>Introducing locality in some generalized AG codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1999, Xing, Niederreiter and Lam introduced a generalization of AG codes using the evaluation at non-rational places of a function field. In this paper, we show that one can obtain a locality parameter $r$ in such codes by using only non-rational places of degrees at most $r$. This is, up to the author's knowledge, a new way to construct locally recoverable codes (LRCs). We give an example of such a code reaching the Singleton-like bound for LRCs, and show the parameters obtained for some longer codes over $\mathbb F_3$. We then investigate similarities with certain concatenated codes. Contrary to previous methods, our construction allows one to obtain directly codes whose dimension is not a multiple of the locality. Finally, we give an asymptotic study using the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields, for both our construction and a construction of concatenated codes. We give explicit infinite families of LRCs with locality 2 over any finite field of cardinality greater than 3 following our new approach.</description>

      <title>Special Joyce structures and hyperk\"ahler metrics</title>

Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Nef cones of fiber products and an application to the Cone Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition theorem for the nef cone of smooth fiber products over curves, subject to the necessary condition that their N\'eron--Severi space decomposes. We apply it to describe the nef cone of so-called Schoen varieties, which are the higher dimensional analogues of the Calabi--Yau threefolds constructed by Schoen. Schoen varieties give rise to Calabi--Yau pairs, and in each dimension at least three, there exist Schoen varieties with non-polyhedral nef cone. We prove the Kawamata--Morrison--Totaro Cone Conjecture for the nef cones of Schoen varieties, which generalizes the work by Grassi and Morrison.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the hyperbolicity of complex quasi-projective varieties $X$ and the (topological) fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ in the presence of a linear representation $\varrho: \pi_1(X) \to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. We present our main results in three parts.
  Firstly, we show that if $\varrho$ is bigand the Zariski closure of $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ semisimple, then for any $X^\sigma:=X\times_\sigma\mathbb{C}$ where $\sigma\in {\rm Aut}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q})$, there exists a proper Zariski closed subset $Z \subsetneqq X^\sigma$ such that any closed irreducible subvariety $V$ of $X^\sigma$ not contained in $Z$ is of log general type, and any holomorphic map from the punctured disk $\mathbb{D}^*$ to $X^\sigma$ with image not contained in $Z$ does not have an essential singularity at the origin. In particular, all entire curves in $X^\sigma$ lie on $Z$. We provide examples to illustrate the optimality of this condition.
  Secondly, assuming that $\varrho$ is big and reductive, we prove the generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture for $X^\sigma$. Furthermore, if $\varrho$ is large, we show that the special subsets of $X^\sigma$ that capture the non-hyperbolicity locus of $X^\sigma$ from different perspectives are equal, and this subset is proper if and only if $X$ is of log general type.
  Lastly, we prove that if $X$ is a special quasi-projective manifold in the sense of Campana or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually nilpotent. We provides examples to demonstrate that this result is sharp and thus revise Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties.
  To prove these theorems, we develop new features in non-abelian Hodge theory, geometric group theory, and Nevanlinna theory. Some byproducts are obtained.</description>

      <title>Mirror Map for Landau-Ginzburg models with nonabelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BHK mirror symmetry as introduced by Berglund--H\"ubsch and Marc Krawitz between Landau--Ginzburg (LG) models has been the topic of much study in recent years. An LG model is determined by a potential function and a group of symmetries. BHK mirror symmetry is only valid when the group of symmetries is comprised of the so-called diagonal symmetries. Recently, an extension to BHK mirror symmetry to include nonabelian symmetry groups has been conjectured. In this article, we provide a mirror map at the level of state spaces between the LG A-model state space and the LG B-model state space for the mirror model predicted by the BHK mirror symmetry extension for nonabelian LG models. We introduce two technical conditions, the Diagonal Scaling Condition, and the Equivariant $\Phi$ condition, under which a bi-degree preserving isomorphism of state spaces (the mirror map) is guaranteed to exist, and we prove that the condition is always satisfied if the permutation part of the group is cyclic of prime order.</description>

      <title>A virtual Clebsch-Gordan formula for $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12730v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to study the group scheme $G:=\operatorname{SL}(2, A)$, it's comodules and a virtual Clebsch-Gordan formula. Here $A$ is a field or a Dedekind domain. If $V:=A\{e_1,e_2\}$ is the free rank $2$ module on $A$ and if we give $V$ the "standard" structure as comodule on $G$, we may form the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^n(V)$ for $n \geq 1$ an integer. If $A$ is a field of characteristic zero, there is a direct sum decomposition of the tensor product $\operatorname{Sym}^n(V) \otimes \operatorname{Sym}^m(V)$ into irreducible $G$-comodules and the main aim of the paper is to investigate if similar results hold over the ring of integers or a more general commutative ring such as a Dedekind domain. For $A:=\mathbb{Z}$ we will find that there is for any pair of integers $1 \leq n \leq m$ a finite filtration $F_i \subseteq \operatorname{Sym}^n(V) \otimes \operatorname{Sym}^m(V)$ with $F_i/F_{i+1} \cong \operatorname{Sym}^{n+m-2i}(V)$ for $i=0,..,n$. This implies there is a version of the Clebsch-Gordan formula valid in the Grothendieck group of coherent comodules on $G$. We moreover prove that the group scheme $G$ is not "completely reducible" in the sense that there are surjections $\phi: V \rightarrow W$ of finite rank comodules on $G$ that do not split. I also discuss the notion "good filtration" for torsion free comodules and give an explicit construction of an infinte set of non trival comodules with a good filtration. I give a functorial definition of the dual comodule of any comodule $(V, \Delta)$, where $V$ is a free and finite rank $A$-module. This construction has the property that the double dual $V^{**}$ is canonically isomorphic to $V$ as comodule. I use the construction to study the dual of the symmetric powers and symmetric tensors of the standard module and give explicit examples of comodules without a good filtration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct Lagrangian torus fibrations in degenerations of K\"ahler manifolds. We show that such torus fibrations naturally occur at the boundary of the A'Campo space. This space extends a degeneration over a punctured disc to a hybrid space involving its real oriented blowup and the dual complex of the special fiber; equipped with an exact modification of a given K\"ahler form which becomes fiberwise symplectic at the boundary. Therefore, it allows to move Lagrangian tori from the boundary using the symplectic connection. In the setting of maximal Calabi-Yau degenerations, we prove that our tori have some asymptotic properties expected from the (conjectural) Strominger-Yau-Zaslow fibration.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new Weil cohomology for smooth projective varieties over a field, universal among Weil cohomologies with values in rigid additive tensor categories. A similar universal problem for Weil cohomologies with values in rigid abelian tensor categories also has a solution. We give a variant for Weil cohomologies satisfying more axioms, like Weak and Hard Lefschetz. As a consequence, we get a different construction of Andr\'e's category of motives for motivated correspondences and show that it has a universal property. This theory extends over suitable bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the rationality of the characteristic form for a degree one character of the Galois group of an abelian extension of henselian discrete valuation fields. We prove the integrality of the characteristic form for a rank one sheaf on a regular excellent scheme. These properties are shown by reducing to the corresponding properties of the refined Swan conductor proved by Kato. We define the F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface as a cycle on the FW-cotangent bundle using the characteristic form on the basis of the computation of the characteristic cycle in the equal characteristic case by Yatagawa. The rationality and the integrality of the characteristic form are necessary for the definition of the F-characteristic cycle. We prove the intersection of the F-characteristic cycle with the 0-section computes the Swan conductor of cohomology of the generic fiber.</description>

Abstract: We explain how to calculate the Fukaya category of the Milnor fiber of a Berglund-H\"ubsch invertible polynomial, mostly proving a conjecture of Yank{\i} Lekili and Kazushi Ueda on homological mirror symmetry. As usual, we begin by calculating the "very affine" Fukaya category; afterwards, we deform it, generalizing an earlier calculation of David Nadler. The main step of our calculation may be understood as determining a certain canonical extension of a perverse schober.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the concept of gluing in mathematics by introducing the notions of a gluing data category and a gluing data functor. Our work provides a formal categorical characterization of the notion of gluing in algebraic geometry. By using this characterization, we are able to describe gluing in a unified way that applies to a wide range of mathematical structures, including topological spaces, presheaves, sheaves, ringed topological spaces, locally ringed topological spaces, and schemes. Our results provide a fresh perspective on gluing that is both abstract and formal, offering a deeper understanding of this fundamental concept in mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit methods of proof of the Adams Conjecture in order to correct and supplement earlier efforts to prove analogous conjectures in the stable homotopy category. We utilize simplicial schemes over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and a rigid version of Artin-Mazur \'etale homotopy theory. Consideration of special $\mathcal F$-spaces and together with Bousfield-Kan $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completion enables us to employ an "\'etale functor" which commutes up to homotopy with products of simplicial schemes. In order to prove the Stable Adams Conjecture, we construct the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations for various pointed simplicial sets $X$. Thus, two maps from a given $\mathcal F$-space $\underline{\mathcal B}$ to the base $\mathcal F$-space of the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibration $\pi_{X,\ell}: \underline {\mathcal B} (G_\ell(X),X_\ell) \to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(X)$ determine homotopy equivalent maps of spectra if and only they correspond via pull-back of $\pi_{X,\ell}$ to fiber homotopy equivalent $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations over $\underline {\mathcal B}$. For the proof of the Stable Adams Conjecture, we consider maps of $\mathcal F$-spaces $\underline {\mathcal B }\to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(S^2)$ where $\underline {\mathcal B}$ is an $\mathcal F$-space model of connective $\ell$-completed connective $K$-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains heuristics for Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over global function fields. As a consequence, we derive a result towards the "minimalist conjecture" on Selmer ranks of abelian varieties in such families. More precisely, we show that the probabilities predicted in these two conjectures are correct to within an error term in the size of the constant field, $q$, which goes to $0$ as $q$ grows. Two key inputs are a new homological stability theorem for a generalized version of Hurwitz spaces parameterizing covers of punctured Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, and an expression of average sizes of Selmer groups in terms of the number of rational points on these Hurwitz spaces over finite fields.</description>

Abstract: We provide a geometric interpretation for the connecting homomorphism in the localization sequence of Hermitian $K$-theory. As an application, we compute the Hermitian $K$-theory of projective bundles and Grassmannians in the regular case. We provide an explicit basis for Hermitian $K$-theory of Grassmannians, which is indexed by even Young diagrams together with another special class of Young diagrams, that we call $\textit{buffalo-check}$ Young diagrams. To achieve this, we develop pushforwards and pullbacks in Hermitian $K$-theory using Grothendieck's residue complexes, and we establish fundamental theorems for those pushforwards and pullbacks, including base change, projection, and excess intersection formulas.</description>

Abstract: This semi-expository note clarifies the extent to which recent ideas in homological stability can resolve the Ratios Conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. For large fixed $q$, a uniform power saving at distance $\ge q^{-\delta}$ from the critical line is possible. This implies cancellation-beyond-GRH in arbitrarily large ranges of moduli relative to the family of $L$-functions. It has applications to the statistics of low-lying zeros.</description>

Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. Schubert calculus via the splitting principle leads to an explicit general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this expansion for the 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>
