      <title>SeedProteo: Accurate De Novo All-Atom Design of Protein Binders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SeedProteo, a diffusion-based model for de novo all-atom protein design. We demonstrate how to repurpose a cutting-edge folding architecture into a powerful generative design framework by effectively integrating self-conditioning features. Extensive benchmarks highlight the model's capabilities across two distinct tasks: in unconditional generation, SeedProteo exhibits superior length generalization and structural diversity, maintaining robustness for long sequences and complex topologies; in binder design, it achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods, attaining the highest in-silico design success rates, structural diversity and novelty.</description>

      <title>SeedFold: Scaling Biomolecular Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly accurate biomolecular structure prediction is a key component of developing biomolecular foundation models, and one of the most critical aspects of building foundation models is identifying the recipes for scaling the model. In this work, we present SeedFold, a folding model that successfully scales up the model capacity. Our contributions are threefold: first, we identify an effective width-scaling strategy for the Pairformer to increase representation capacity; second, we introduce a novel linear triangular attention that reduces computational complexity to enable efficient scaling; finally, we construct a large-scale distillation dataset to substantially enlarge the training set. Experiments on FoldBench show that SeedFold outperforms AlphaFold3 on most protein-related tasks.</description>

      <title>Sheaf-theoretic representation of the proteolipid code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane particles such as proteins and lipids organize into zones that perform unique functions. Here, I introduce a topological and category-theoretic framework to represent particle and zone intra-scale interactions and inter-scale coupling. This involves carefully demarcating between different presheaf- or sheaf-assigned data levels to preserve functorial structure and account for particle and zone generalized poses. The framework can accommodate Hamiltonian mechanics, enabling dynamical modeling. This amounts to a versatile mathematical formalism for membrane structure and multiscale coupling.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Framework for logP Prediction: From Terabyte-Scale Data Integration to Interpretable Ensemble Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.</description>
