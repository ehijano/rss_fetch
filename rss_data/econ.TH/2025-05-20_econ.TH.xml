      <title>AI Agents in the Electricity Market Game with Cryptocurrency Transactions: A Post-Terminator Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends (Spear 2003) by replacing human agents with artificial intelligence (AI) entities that derive utility solely from electricity consumption. These AI agents must prepay for electricity using cryptocurrency and the verification of these transactions requires a fixed amount of electricity. As a result the agents must strategically allocate electricity resources between consumption and payment verification. This paper analyzes the equilibrium outcomes of such a system and discusses the implications of AI-driven energy markets.</description>

      <title>Communication with Multiple Senders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a cheap talk model with one receiver and multiple senders. Each sender observes a noisy signal regarding an unknown state of the world. Existing literature (e.g., Levit and Malenko, 2011; Battaglini, 2017) focuses on scenarios where the receiver and senders have aligned preferences in each state. We further explore situations with disagreement states in which the receiver and the senders have misaligned preferences. We first show that, when the number of senders grows large, each sender's message must convey almost no information to the receiver. Furthermore, we identify a discontinuity in information transmission: with moderate conflict between the receiver and the senders, introducing an arbitrarily small probability of disagreement states causes complete unraveling, contrary to full learning predicted by the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the receiver cannot fully learn the state even when receiving messages from arbitrarily many senders.</description>

      <title>Weakest Bidder Types and New Core-Selecting Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-selecting combinatorial auctions are popular auction designs that constrain prices to eliminate the incentive for any group of bidders -- with the seller -- to renegotiate for a better deal. They help overcome the low-revenue issues of classical combinatorial auctions. We introduce a new class of core-selecting combinatorial auctions that leverage bidder information available to the auction designer. We model such information through constraints on the joint type space of the bidders -- these are constraints on bidders' private valuations that are known to hold by the auction designer before bids are elicited. First, we show that type space information can overcome the well-known impossibility of incentive-compatible core-selecting combinatorial auctions. We present a revised and generalized version of that impossibility result that depends on how much information is conveyed by the type spaces. We then devise a new family of core-selecting combinatorial auctions and show that they minimize the sum of bidders' incentives to deviate from truthful bidding. We develop new constraint generation techniques -- and build upon existing quadratic programming techniques -- to compute core prices, and conduct experiments to evaluate the incentive, revenue, fairness, and computational merits of our new auctions. Our new core-selecting auctions directly improve upon existing designs that have been used in many high-stakes auctions around the world. We envision that they will be a useful addition to any auction designer's toolkit.</description>

      <title>Revenue-Optimal Efficient Mechanism Design with General Type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the revenue-optimal efficient (welfare-maximizing) mechanism in a general multidimensional mechanism design setting when type spaces -- that is, the underlying domains from which agents' values come from -- can capture arbitrarily complex informational constraints about the agents. Type spaces can encode information about agents representing, for example, machine learning predictions of agent behavior, institutional knowledge about feasible market outcomes (such as item substitutability or complementarity in auctions), and correlations between multiple agents. Prior work has only dealt with connected type spaces, which are not expressive enough to capture many natural kinds of constraints such as disjunctive constraints. We provide two characterizations of the optimal mechanism based on allocations and connected components; both make use of an underlying network flow structure to the mechanism design. Our results significantly generalize and improve the prior state of the art in revenue-optimal efficient mechanism design. They also considerably expand the scope of what forms of agent information can be expressed and used to improve revenue.</description>

      <title>Decision theory and the "almost implies near" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional decision theory establishes equivalence between axioms and the functional forms of utility representations. In this paper, we develop a new framework where axioms need only be approximately satisfied, introducing a principled approach to measuring the degree of axiom violations. Our central finding is that behavior that "almost" satisfies canonical axioms induces utility representations that are "near" the standard utility forms associated with those axioms. Specifically, when agents approximately satisfy axioms like independence or stationarity, their utility functions can be approximated by the corresponding canonical utilities, with quantifiable error bounds directly linked to the magnitude of axiom violations.
  We apply this phenomenon across three domains: decisions under risk, uncertainty, and intertemporal choice. Our results provide theoretical foundations for approximate optimization in economics and offer a middle ground between rejecting theories and requiring exact axioms, and accommodating small deviations from the theory in empirical work.</description>
