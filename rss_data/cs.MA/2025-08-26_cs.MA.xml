      <title>Consensus Is All You Need: Gossip-Based Reasoning Among Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems, where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement. In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy instead of just a black-box program.</description>

      <title>Murakkab: Resource-Efficient Agentic Workflow Orchestration in Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy, latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by 4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.</description>

      <title>Toward Generalized Autonomous Agents: A Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework for Integrating Social and Technical Support in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems, meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer' agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.</description>

      <title>Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Formation Flying Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces and Control Barrier Functions for State and Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs. The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation control method in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bias-Adjusted LLM Agents for Human-Like Decision-Making via Behavioral Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns at scale.</description>

      <title>DELIVER: A System for LLM-Guided Coordinated Multi-Robot Pickup and Delivery using Voronoi-Based Relay Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.</description>

      <title>Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).</description>

      <title>MATRIX: Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured scenarios, and datasets.</description>

      <title>Safe Multiagent Coordination via Entropic Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world multiagent learning problems involve safety concerns. In these setups, typical safe reinforcement learning algorithms constrain agents' behavior, limiting exploration -- a crucial component for discovering effective cooperative multiagent behaviors. Moreover, the multiagent literature typically models individual constraints for each agent and has yet to investigate the benefits of using joint team constraints. In this work, we analyze these team constraints from a theoretical and practical perspective and propose entropic exploration for constrained multiagent reinforcement learning (E2C) to address the exploration issue. E2C leverages observation entropy maximization to incentivize exploration and facilitate learning safe and effective cooperative behaviors. Experiments across increasingly complex domains show that E2C agents match or surpass common unconstrained and constrained baselines in task performance while reducing unsafe behaviors by up to $50\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative reasoning and solving complex tasks. However, the design of collaborative learning algorithms in multi-agent systems faces several challenges, including high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level personalization. In this paper, we propose PE-MA (Parameter-Efficient Multi-Agent Co-Evolution), a novel collaboration framework that supports efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution in multi-agent systems. In PE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support agent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized across neighboring agents. This design balances global coordination with local adaptation under heterogeneous environments. We achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of O( 1/(NK)^(1/2) ), where N is the number of agents and K the local update steps.</description>

      <title>Conformal Data-driven Control of Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address control synthesis of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems under jointly chance-constrained collaborative signal temporal logic specifications in a distribution-free manner using available disturbance samples, which are partitioned into training and calibration sets. Leveraging linearity, we decompose each agent's system into deterministic nominal and stochastic error parts, and design disturbance feedback controllers to bound the stochastic errors by solving a tractable optimization problem over the training data. We then quantify prediction regions (PRs) for the aggregate error trajectories corresponding to agent cliques, involved in collaborative tasks, using conformal prediction and calibration data. This enables us to address the specified joint chance constraint via Lipschitz tightening and the computed PRs, and relax the centralized stochastic optimal control problem to a deterministic one, whose solution provides the feedforward inputs. To enhance scalability, we decompose the deterministic problem into agent-level subproblems solved in an MPC fashion, yielding a distributed control policy. Finally, we present an illustrative example and a comparison with [1].</description>

      <title>The Influence of Human-inspired Agentic Sophistication in LLM-driven Strategic Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.</description>

      <title>An Agentic System for Rare Disease Diagnosis with Traceable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20430</link>

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>
