      <title>EFS: Evolutionary Factor Searching for Sparse Portfolio Optimization Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse portfolio optimization is a fundamental yet challenging problem in quantitative finance, since traditional approaches heavily relying on historical return statistics and static objectives can hardly adapt to dynamic market regimes. To address this issue, we propose Evolutionary Factor Search (EFS), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation and evolution of alpha factors for sparse portfolio construction. By reformulating the asset selection problem as a top-m ranking task guided by LLM-generated factors, EFS incorporates an evolutionary feedback loop to iteratively refine the factor pool based on performance. Extensive experiments on five Fama-French benchmark datasets and three real-market datasets (US50, HSI45 and CSI300) demonstrate that EFS significantly outperforms both statistical-based and optimization-based baselines, especially in larger asset universes and volatile conditions. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of prompt composition, factor diversity, and LLM backend choice. Our results highlight the promise of language-guided evolution as a robust and interpretable paradigm for portfolio optimization under structural constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trading under Instantaneous and Persistent Price Impact, Predictable Returns and Multiscale Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic portfolio optimization problem that incorporates predictable returns, instantaneous transaction costs, price impact, and stochastic volatility, extending the classical results of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), which assume constant volatility. Constructing the optimal portfolio strategy in this general setting is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. To address this, we propose a multi-scale volatility expansion that captures stochastic volatility dynamics across different time scales. Specifically, the analysis involves a singular perturbation for the fast mean-reverting volatility factor and a regular perturbation for the slow-moving factor. We also introduce an approximation for small price impact and demonstrate its numerical accuracy. We formally derive asymptotic approximations up to second order and use Monte Carlo simulations to show how incorporating these corrections improves the Profit and Loss (PnL) of the resulting portfolio strategy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification and Portfolio Allocation: with Implications from Machine Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use multi-class machine learning classifiers to identify the stocks that outperform or underperform other stocks. The resulting long-short portfolios achieve annual Sharpe ratios of 1.67 (value-weighted) and 3.35 (equal-weighted), with annual alphas ranging from 29\% to 48\%. These results persist after controlling for machine learning regressions and remain robust among large-cap stocks. Machine uncertainty, as measured by predicted probabilities, impairs the prediction performance. Stocks with higher machine uncertainty experience lower returns, particularly when human proxies of information uncertainty align with machine uncertainty. Consistent with the literature, such an effect is driven by the past underperformers.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making and Arbitrage Profits in the Presence of Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of trading fees on the profits of arbitrageurs trading against an automated market maker (AMM) or, equivalently, on the adverse selection incurred by liquidity providers (LPs) due to arbitrage. We extend the model of Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class of two asset AMMs to introduce both fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our setting, we are able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in closed form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the impact of fees takes a particularly simple form: fees simply scale down arbitrage profits by the fraction of blocks which present profitable trading opportunities to arbitrageurs. This fraction decreases with an increasing block rate, hence our model yields an important practical insight: faster blockchains will result in reduced LP losses. Further introducing gas fees (fixed costs) in our model, we show that, in the fast block asymptotic regime, lower gas fees lead to smaller losses for LPs.</description>
