      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Probabilities of Beneficial Mutation and Crossover Recombination in a Hamming Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Fisher's geometric approach to study beneficial mutations, we analyse probabilities of beneficial mutation and crossover recombination of strings in a general Hamming space with arbitrary finite alphabet. Mutations and recombinations that reduce the distance to an optimum are considered as beneficial. Geometric and combinatorial analysis is used to derive closed-form expressions for transition probabilities between spheres around an optimum giving a complete description of Markov evolution of distances from an optimum over multiple generations. This paves the way for optimization of parameters of mutation and recombination operators. Here we derive optimality conditions for mutation and recombination radii maximizing the probabilities of mutation and crossover into the optimum. The analysis highlights important differences between these evolutionary operators. While mutation can potentially reach any part of the search space, the probability of beneficial mutation decreases with distance to an optimum, and the optimal mutation radius or rate should also decrease resulting in a slow-down of evolution near the optimum. Crossover recombination, on the other hand, acts in a subspace of the search space defined by the current population of strings. However, probabilities of beneficial and deleterious crossover are balanced, and their characteristics, such as variance, are translation invariant in a Hamming space, suggesting that recombination may complement mutation and boost the rate of evolution near the optimum.</description>

      <title>Invasive species control via a discrete model for the Trojan Y-chromosome strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invasive species are a growing threat to ecosystems, particularly in aquatic environments. The Trojan Y Chromosome (TYC) strategy is a promising biological method for reducing invasive populations by introducing genetically modified males (supermales) that produce only male offspring, leading to population decline due to a shortage of females. In this study, we develop a novel discrete--time, age--structured mathematical model to simulate the effects of this strategy. Our model divides the life cycle of species into two stages--egg and maturity--and tracks different sub--populations, including supermales. We analyze the equilibria of the system and prove the existence and stability of extinction and positive equilibrium points. Numerical simulations show that extinction depends on factors such as fecundity, the number of supermales released, and initial population sizes. The model also reveals complex behaviors, such as bistability and thresholds for population collapse. This discrete approach offers a useful framework for understanding and optimizing the TYC strategy and can help guide future field applications of invasive species control.</description>

      <title>Improving wastewater-based epidemiology through strategic placement of samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a fast emerging method for passively monitoring diseases in a population. By measuring the concentrations of pathogenic materials in wastewater, WBE negates demographic biases in clinical testing and healthcare demand, and may act as a leading indicator of disease incidence.
  For a WBE system to be effective, it should detect the presence of a new pathogen of concern early enough and with enough precision that it can still be localised and contained. In this study, then, we show how multiple wastewater sensors can be strategically placed across a wastewater system, to detect the presence of disease faster than if sampling was done at the wastewater treatment plant only. Our approach generalises to any tree-like network and takes into account the structure of the network and how the population is distributed over it.
  We show how placing sensors further upstream from the treatment plant improves detection sensitivity and can inform how an outbreak is evolving in different geographical regions. However, this improvement diminishes once individual-level shedding is modelled as highly dispersed. With overdispersed shedding, we show using real COVID-19 cases in Scotland that broad trends in disease incidence (i.e., whether the epidemic is in growth or decline) can still be reasonably estimated from the wastewater signal once incidence exceeds about 5 infections per day.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Vaccination on Rotavirus Transmission Dynamics Using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2013 led to a noticeable decline in laboratory reports in subsequent years. To assess the impact of vaccination on rotavirus transmissibility we calibrated a stochastic compartmental epidemiological model using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Our analysis focuses on estimating the time-varying transmissibility parameter and documenting its evolution before and after vaccine rollout. We observe distinct periods of increasing and decreasing transmissibility, reflecting the dynamic response of rotavirus spread to immunization efforts. These findings improve our understanding of vaccination-driven shifts in disease transmission and provide a quantitative framework for evaluating long-term epidemiological trends.</description>

      <title>Recent trends in socio-epidemic modelling: behaviours and their determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spreading dynamics of infectious diseases is influenced by individual behaviours, which are in turn affected by the level of awareness about the epidemic. Modelling the co-evolution of disease transmission and behavioural changes within a population enables better understanding, prediction and control of epidemics. Here, our primary goal is to provide an overview of the most popular modelling approaches, ranging from compartmental mean-field to agent-based models, with a particular focus on how behavioural factors are incorporated into epidemic dynamics. We classify modelling approaches based on the fundamental conceptual distinction between models of behaviours and models of behavioural determinants (such as awareness, beliefs, opinions, or trust); in particular, we observe that most studies model and interpret the variables related to individual responses either as behaviours or as determinants, with the implicit assumption that they correlate linearly. Based on preliminary empirical observations, we then challenge this assumption by analysing a recent dataset about time series of social indicators, collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine the case study of Italian regions and we discover that behavioural responses are poorly explained by awareness, beliefs or trust, thereby calling for a careful interpretation of the modelling assumptions and for the development of further models, which fully account for the inherent complexity of individual responses and human behaviours.</description>
