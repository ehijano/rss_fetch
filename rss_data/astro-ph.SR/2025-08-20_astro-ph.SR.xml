      <title>Stable magnetic fields and changing starspots on Vega -- An ultra-deep decadal survey at Pic du Midi and OHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring magnetic and activity variations in A- and B-type stars with ultra-weak magnetic fields is essential to understand the origin and evolution of these fields in this region of the HR diagram, with Vega standing as the prototype of this category. We collected high-resolution spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data with SOPHIE (OHP, 2018) and with NARVAL/NEO-NARVAL (TBL, 2018, 2023, and 2024), yielding a total of 13108 individual spectra. Magnetic field maps were reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging method, while brightness maps were derived with a dedicated code developed for this purpose. The average magnetic field confirms a negative radial-field spot at the pole with stable strength, while the maps reveal the long-term stability of an oblique dipole together with smaller magnetic structures consistently detected across observing epochs. In contrast, brightness maps show strong variations in the location of surface spots on timescales of years, possibly shorter, although the spot contrast remains nearly unchanged between 2012, 2018, 2023, and 2024, with a normalized spectral amplitude of 0.0003. No direct correlation between magnetic and brightness features could be established in the simultaneous SOPHIE and NARVAL dataset of 2018. These results suggest that Vega hosts both a persistent fossil magnetic field and a dynamo-generated component, most likely concentrated in equatorial regions.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observation of Solar Prominence Plumes Induced by Enhanced Spicular Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences are the most prominent large-scale structures observed above the solar limb in emission in chromospheric lines but in absorption in coronal lines. At the bottom of prominences often appears a bubble, with plumes occasionally rising from the prominence-bubble interface. The plumes may potentially play an important role in the mass supply and thermodynamic evolution of prominences, but their nature and generation mechanism are elusive. Here we use the high-resolution H-alpha observations obtained by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to investigate a quiescent prominence with bubbles and plumes on 8 November 2022. Within an interval of about two hours, enhanced spicular activity disturb the prominence-bubble interface, producing bursts of small-scale plumes rising through the prominence. Characterized by clustered spicules jetting at higher speeds (sometimes exceeding the typical chromopsheric Alfven speed) and longer life-time (over 15 minutes), the enhanced spicular activity differs markedly from regular spicules. We hence conjecture that the enhanced spicular activity may drive shock waves, which trigger the magnetic Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the prominence-bubble interface, leading to the formation of small-scale plumes. These observations provide evidence that the enhanced spicular activity plays a potentially important role in the dynamic evolution of bubbles and plumes, thereby participating in the mass supply of solar prominences.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.</description>

      <title>The effect of poloidal magnetic field and helicity injection on a breakout CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as crucial drivers of space weather, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their initiation and evolution in the solar corona, in order to better predict their propagation. Solar Cycle 24 exhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a decrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher frequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is vital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global magnetic parameters using datasets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARP), have been employed in earlier works. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a magnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface - Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) in 2.5 dimensions. By employing the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar magnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field, inducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on understanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME eruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic parameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, multiple eruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of shear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an increase in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains CME eruptions. Furthermore, we establish that the growth rate of absolute net current helicity is the crucial factor that determines the likelihood of CME eruptions.</description>

      <title>The Unexplored Dusty Nova LMCN 2009-05a in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectrophotometric study of nova LMCN 2009-05a, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Photometric observations reveal a dust dip in the optical light curve, classifying it as a D-class nova. Light curve analysis yields t2 and t3 decline times of approximately 46 and 80 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of moderately fast novae. Spectroscopic observations cover multiple phases, including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are initially dominated by hydrogen Balmer and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles, which later transition into pure emission. During the optical minimum, a discrete absorption feature was observed in the H{\alpha} and [O I] line profiles. The physical and chemical properties during the early decline and nebular phases were analyzed using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Dust temperature, mass, and grain size were estimated through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the WISE data. On day 395 post-outburst, we estimate the dust temperature to be approximately 700 K. Additionally, we examined the correlation between dust condensation time (tcond ) and t2 for LMC novae, finding a trend consistent with previous studies of Galactic novae.</description>

      <title>Learning to Estimate Photospheric Vector Fields from Line-of-Sight Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than full vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be obtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the perpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear polarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not physically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and one whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an estimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied that assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper investigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on the recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors as input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method accepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as output, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components, meaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without need for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate the ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen examples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a replacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to unlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate Br maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of M&amp;M Eclipsing Binaries with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 1292 low-mass (M&amp;M) short-period eclipsing binaries observed by the TESS mission. Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models. Catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize both the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the stars in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&amp;Ms. We compare distributions of orbital and physical properties to other relevant datasets. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio "twin" M&amp;Ms. We find that M&amp;Ms do not exhibit an overdensity of contact binaries, which is different from previous results for solar-type binaries. Further, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.7 days, which is significantly shorter compared to the literature value of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&amp;Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&amp;Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.</description>

      <title>EUV Late Phase Flares as Observed by EVE and AIA Onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. EUV late phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, yet it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it.
  Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties like eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale.
  Methods. We primarily make use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complimentary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantify the criteria for ELP flare definition and determine its characteristics.
  Results. Our analysis shows that about 10% of all flares with a GOES class greater than or equal to C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energetic counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flares is confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population (greater than or equal to C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.</description>

      <title>A Near-Infrared Spectral Library of Very Young Brown Dwarfs and Planetary-Mass Objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age-benchmark brown dwarfs' and planetary-mass objects' spectroscopy is key to characterize substellar evolution. In this paper we present the JHK medium resolution (R~3000) spectra of 25 7-75 M_Jup (spectral types L3.0-M6.0) brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with MOSFIRE installed at the W. M. Keck I telescope. We obtained the spectral types of the targets in our sample using template brown dwarf and planetary-mass objects' spectra. We confirmed their extreme youth (&lt;5 Myr) and membership to the cluster using spectral indices, and the diversity of their spectra even for targets with similar spectral types. Six of our targets presented Pa-beta and Bra-gamma emission lines, suggesting the existence of accreting protoplanetary disks to objects with masses as low as 7 M_Jup. After analyzing the emission lines of those objects, and measuring their accretion rates, we compared them to those of stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects, confirming that planetary-mass young objects deplete their disks quickly at young ages. Finally, we illustrate the spectral evolution of a 7-10 M_Jup planetary-mass object through its life from 1-3 Myr to 200 Myr old using one of our latest spectra type targets, and other targets from the literature with older age, but similar estimated masses. The spectra are publicly available for the community's use as data behind the figures.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: regular and divergent scalar field configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The CCOR Compact Coronagraphs for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-19 (GOES-19) and the Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase Molecules in Protoplanetary Nebulae with the 21 {\mu}m Emission Feature II. Carbon monosulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carrier of the 21 ${\mu}$m emission feature discovered in a handful of protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) is one of the most intriguing enigmas in circumstellar chemistry. Investigating the gas-phase molecules in PPNe could yield important hints for understanding the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. In this paper, we report observations of the CS $J = 5 \to 4$ line at 245 GHz and the CO $J = 1 \to 0$ line at 115 GHz toward seven PPNe exhibiting the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. We find that CS is extremely scarce in these PPNe and the CS line is only detected in one source, IRAS Z02229+6208. Based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible optical depth, we derive that the CS column densities and fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ are $N$(CS) &lt; 9.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $f$(CS) &lt; 8.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{-7}$. A comparison of the CS abundances across different circumstellar envelopes reveals that the variations in CS abundance are complex, depending not only on the evolutionary stages but also on the properties of individual objects.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Thin coronal jets and plasmoid-mediated reconnection: Insights from Solar Orbiter observations and Bifrost simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal jets are ubiquitous, collimated million-degree ejections that contribute to the energy and mass supply of the upper solar atmosphere and the solar wind. Solar Orbiter provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe fine-scale jets from a unique vantage point close to the Sun. We aim to uncover thin jets originating from Coronal Bright Points (CBPs) and investigate observable features of plasmoid-mediated reconnection. We analyze eleven datasets from the High Resolution Imager 174 \r{A} of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV) onboard Solar Orbiter, focusing on narrow jets from CBPs and signatures of magnetic reconnection within current sheets and outflow regions. To support the observations, we compare with CBP simulations performed with the Bifrost code. We have identified thin coronal jets originating from CBPs with widths ranging from 253 km to 706 km: scales that could not be resolved with previous EUV imaging instruments. Remarkably, these jets are 30-85% brighter than their surroundings and can extend up to 22 Mm while maintaining their narrow form. In one of the datasets, we directly identify plasmoid-mediated reconnection through the development within the current sheet of a small-scale plasmoid that reaches a size of 332 km and propagates at 40 km/s. In another dataset, we infer plasmoid signatures through the intermittent boomerang-like pattern that appears in the outflow region. Both direct and indirect plasmoid-mediated reconnection signatures are supported by comparisons with the synthetic HRIEUV emission from the simulations.</description>

      <title>Transition metal abundance as a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Discrete element simulations of self-gravitating rubble pile collisions: the effects of non-uniform particle size and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of a soft sphere, discrete elements code to simulate the dynamics of self-gravitating granular materials. The code is used to study the outcome of sub-sonic collisions between self-gravitating rubble piles with masses ranging from $\sim6\times10^{21}$ to $\sim6\times10^{22}$ g. These masses are representative of asteroids and planetesimals in the $\sim100$~km range. We simulate rubble piles composed of a range of particle sizes and analyze the collisions outcome focusing on the properties of the largest surviving fragment. We successfully test and validate the code against previous results. The results of our study show that rubble piles formed by collision of two parent rubble piles do not maintain the same particle size distribution as their parents. Rubble piles formed in low velocity collisions are characterized by a larger fraction of large particles, while the largest fragments of high-velocity collisions show a significant decrease in their mean particle size. We ascribe this effect to the fact that large particles transmit most of the forces during the collisions. In addition, we find that the mass of the largest post-collision fragment does depend on the rotation of the colliding rubble piles. This effect is especially noticeable when the pre-collision spin axes are parallel with each other and perpendicular to the relative velocity. This finding can be particularly relevant for meter to kilometer sized bodies embedded in protostellar accretion disks, where viscous stresses can efficiently align the target and projectile spin axes.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Outer Edge of the Infant Type Ia Supernova 2024epr in the Optical and Near Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical-to-near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024epr, including NIR spectra observed within two days of first light. The early-time optical spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca and Si features near rarely-observed velocities at $\sim$0.1$c$, and the NIR spectra show a C I "knee." Despite early-time, high-velocity features, SN 2024epr evolves into a normal SN Ia, albeit with stronger peak-light Ca absorption than other SNe Ia with the same light curve shape. Although we infer a normal decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve rise, SN 2024epr is a Branch "cool" object and has red early-time colors ($g-r\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density enhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, predicted by some models, but thick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve or apparent lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra. No current models (e.g., delayed detonation or thin He shell double detonation) appear to reproduce all observed properties, particularly the unusual early-time colors. Such constraints are only possible for SN 2024epr from the earliest optical and NIR observations, highlighting their importance for constraining SN Ia models. Finally, we identify several literature SNe Ia with intermediate mass elements at $\sim$30\,000 km s$^{-1}$ within days after the explosion that evolve into otherwise normal SNe Ia at peak light, suggesting the early-time spectra of SNe Ia may hide a broad diversity of observational characteristics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Modelling of Early Peaks in Type Ibc Supernovae with Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a subclass of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the main, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are typically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly attributed to the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain the pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first systematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that incorporates hydrodynamic modelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding within CSM using the multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics code \texttt{STELLA}, exploring a range of SN and CSM properties. By comparing the theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of seven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties. Assuming a wind-like density distribution of CSM, we found CSM masses of $10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \ \Msun$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \times 10^3 \ \Rsun$. While the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained using an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due to a simplified assumption on blackbody temperature used in analytical models. We infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass transfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned \textit{ULTRASAT} high-cadence survey, $\sim 30$ early peaks similar to those in this paper from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.</description>

      <title>Gravity-sensitive Spectral Indices in Ultracool Dwarfs: Investigating Correlations with Metallicity and Planet Occurrence using SpeX and FIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9--2.4~$\mu$m) of gravity indices for 56 ultracool dwarfs (M5.5--L0), including exoplanet hosts SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154, with 59 spectra from SpeX and FIRE and literature data for TRAPPIST-1. Using gravity-sensitive spectral features (FeH at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55~$\mu$m; VO at 1.06~$\mu$m; the H-band continuum; KI at 1.17 and 1.25$\mu$m), we investigate links between gravity classification, metallicity, and planet occurrence. All four planet hosts show intermediate-gravity signatures despite field-age indicators. A volume-corrected logistic regression finds no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z (0.99~$\mu$m) is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status, with a tentative $2\sigma$ correlation that may reflect observational biases. More robustly, FeH_z shows a $3.3\sigma$ anti-correlation with [Fe/H]. A Kruskal--Wallis test finds no metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the FeH_z--[Fe/H] trend is not due to bulk metallicity. We propose this relation reflects the interplay of age, gravity, and composition, with higher-metallicity objects being systematically younger and lower-gravity, reducing FeH absorption. While only hinting at a connection between gravity-sensitive features and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, these results highlight the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to interpret ultracool dwarf planet hosts.</description>
