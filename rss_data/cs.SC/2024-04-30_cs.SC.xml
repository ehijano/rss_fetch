      <title>A Basis-preserving Algorithm for Computing the Bezout Matrix of Newton Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of constructing Bezout matrices for Newton polynomials in a basis-preserving approach that operates directly with the given Newton basis, thus avoiding the need for transformation from Newton basis to monomial basis. This approach significantly reduces the computational cost and also mitigates numerical instability caused by basis transformation. For this purpose, we investigate the internal structure of Bezout matrices in Newton basis and design a basis-preserving algorithm that generates the Bezout matrix in the specified basis used to formulate the input polynomials. Furthermore, we show an application of the proposed algorithm on constructing confederate resultant matrices for Newton polynomials. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform superior to the basis-transformation-based ones.</description>

      <title>Evolving Scientific Discovery by Unifying Data and Background Knowledge with AI Hilbert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of scientific formulae that parsimoniously explain natural phenomena and align with existing background theory is a key goal in science. Historically, scientists have derived natural laws by manipulating equations based on existing knowledge, forming new equations, and verifying them experimentally. In recent years, data-driven scientific discovery has emerged as a viable competitor in settings with large amounts of experimental data. Unfortunately, data-driven methods often fail to discover valid laws when data is noisy or scarce. Accordingly, recent works combine regression and reasoning to eliminate formulae inconsistent with background theory. However, the problem of searching over the space of formulae consistent with background theory to find one that best fits the data is not well-solved. We propose a solution to this problem when all axioms and scientific laws are expressible via polynomial equalities and inequalities and argue that our approach is widely applicable. We model notions of minimal complexity using binary variables and logical constraints, solve polynomial optimization problems via mixed-integer linear or semidefinite optimization, and prove the validity of our scientific discoveries in a principled manner using Positivstellensatz certificates. The optimization techniques leveraged in this paper allow our approach to run in polynomial time with fully correct background theory under an assumption that the complexity of our derivation is bounded), or non-deterministic polynomial (NP) time with partially correct background theory. We demonstrate that some famous scientific laws, including Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, the Hagen-Poiseuille Equation, and the Radiated Gravitational Wave Power equation, can be derived in a principled manner from axioms and experimental data.</description>
