      <title>Necessity of orthogonal basis vectors for the two-anyon problem in one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-body physics for anyons has been intensively studied within the anyon-Hubbard model, including the quantum walk and Bloch oscillations of two-anyon states. However, the known theoretical proposal and experimental simulations of two-anyon states in one-dimensional lattice have been carried out by expanding the wavefunction in terms of non-orthogonal basis vectors, which introduces extra non-physical degrees of freedom. In the present work, we deduce the finite difference equations for the two-anyon state in the one-dimensional lattice by solving the Schr\"odinger equation with orthogonal basis vectors. Such an orthogonal scheme gives all the orthogonal physical eigenstates for the time-independent two-anyon Schr\"odinger equation, while the conventional (non-orthogonal) method produces a lot of non-physical redundant eigen-solutions whose components violate the anyonic relations. The dynamical property of the two-anyon states in a sufficiently large lattice has been investigated and compared in both the orthogonal and conventional schemes, which proves to depend crucially on the initial states. When the initial states with two anyons on the same site or (next-)neighboring sites are suitably chosen to be in accordance with the anyonic coefficient relation, we observe exactly the same dynamical behavior in the two schemes, including the revival probability, the probability density function, and the two-body correlation, otherwise, the conventional scheme will produce erroneous results which not any more describe anyons. The period of the Bloch oscillation in the pseudo-fermionic limit is found to be twice that in the bosonic limit, while the oscillations disappear for statistical parameters in between. Our findings are vital for quantum simulations of few-body physics with anyons in the lattice.</description>

      <title>Laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions in a quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental platforms based on ultracold atomic gases have significantly advanced the quantum simulation of complex systems, yet the exploration of phenomena driven by long-range interactions remains a formidable challenge. Currently available methods utilizing dipolar quantum gases or multi-mode cavities allow to implement long-range interactions with a $1/r^3$ character or with a spatial profile fixed by the mode-structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field surrounding the atoms, respectively. Here we propose an experimental scheme employing laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions, which enables the realization of atom-atom interactions that are fully tunable in range, shape, and sign. Our approach combines the versatility of cavity quantum electrodynamics with the precision of laser manipulation, thus providing a highly flexible platform for simulating and understanding long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations describing the full dynamics of atoms, laser, and cavity. The latter demonstrate that there is a wide and experimentally accessible parameter regime where our protocol optimally works. The methodology not only paves the way for exploring new territories in quantum simulation but also enhances the understanding of fundamental physics, potentially leading to the discovery of novel quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Fast manipulation of a quantum gas on an atom chip with a strong microwave field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental platform based on an atom chip encompassing a coplanar waveguide which enables to manipulate a quantum gas of sodium atoms with strong microwave fields. We describe the production with this setup of a very elongated degenerate quantum gas with typically 10^6 atoms, that can be prepared all along the cross-over from the three-dimensional to the one-dimensional regime depending on the atom number and trapping geometry. Using the microwave field radiated by the waveguide, we drive Rabi oscillations between the hyperfine ground states, with the atoms trapped at various distances from the waveguide. At the closest position explored, the field amplitude exceeds 5 G, corresponding to a Rabi frequency larger than 6 MHz. This enables fast manipulation of the atomic internal state.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on quantum simulations of non-standard Bose-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the systems comprising of bosonic atoms confined to optical lattices at ultra-cold temperatures have demonstrated tremendous potential to unveil novel quantum mechanical effects appearing in lattice boson models with various kinds of interactions. In this progress report, we aim to provide an exposition to recent advancements in quantum simulations of such systems, modeled by different "non-standard" Bose-Hubbard models, focusing primarily on long-range systems with dipole-dipole or cavity-mediated interactions. Through a carefully curated selection of topics, which includes the emergence of quantum criticality beyond Landau paradigm, bond-order wave insulators, the role of interaction-induced tunneling, the influence of transverse confinement on observed phases, or the effect of cavity-mediated all-to-all interactions, we report both theoretical and experimental developments from the last few years. Additionally, we discuss the real-time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, where sufficiently strong interactions render the dynamics non-ergodic. And finally to cap our discussions off, we survey recent experimental achievements in this rapidly evolving field, underscoring its interdisciplinary significance and potential for groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional symbiotic solitons bound by dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of quasi-one- (quasi-1D) and quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) symbiotic solitons bound by an interspecies dipolar interaction in a binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. These binary solitons have a repulsive intraspecies contact interaction stronger than the intraspecies dipolar interaction, so that they can not be bound in isolation in the absence of an interspecies dipolar interaction. These symbiotic solitons are bound in the presence of an interspecies dipolar interaction and zero interspecies contact interaction. The quasi-1D solitons are free to move along the polarization $z$ direction of the dipolar atoms, whereas the quasi-2D solitons move in the $x$-$z$ plane. To illustrate these, we consider a $^{164}$Er-$^{166}$Er mixture with scattering lengths $a$($^{164}$Er)$ =81a_0$ and $a$($^{166}$Er)$ =68a_0$ and with dipolar lengths $a_{\mathrm{dd}}$($^{164}$Er)$\approx a_{\mathrm{dd}}$($^{166}$Er)$\approx 65a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. In each of the two components $a&gt; a_{\mathrm{dd}}$, which stops the binding of solitons in each component in isolation, whereas a binary quasi-1D or a quasi-2D $^{164}$Er-$^{166}$Er soliton is bound in the presence of an interspecies dipolar interaction. The stationary states were obtained by imaginary-time propagation of the underlying mean-field model; dynamical stability of the solitons was established by real-time propagation over a long period of time.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Sensing with Multiparameter Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of a quantum sensor is fundamentally limited by noise. This noise is particularly damaging when it becomes correlated with the readout of a target signal, caused by fluctuations of the sensor's operating parameters. These uncertainties limit sensitivity in a way that can be understood with multiparameter estimation theory. We develop a new approach, adaptable to any quantum platform, for designing robust sensing protocols that leverages multiparameter estimation theory and machine learning to decorrelate a target signal from fluctuating off-target (``nuisance'') parameters. Central to our approach is the identification of information-theoretic goals that guide a machine learning agent through an otherwise intractably large space of potential sensing protocols. As an illustrative example, we apply our approach to a reconfigurable optical lattice to design an accelerometer whose sensitivity is decorrelated from lattice depth noise. We demonstrate the effect of decorrelation on outcomes and Bayesian inferencing through statistical analysis in parameter space, and discuss implications for future applications in quantum metrology and computing.</description>

      <title>Realization of an atomic quantum Hall system in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern condensed matter physics relies on the concept of topology to classify matter, from quantum Hall systems to topological insulators. Engineered systems, benefiting from synthetic dimensions, can potentially give access to novel topological states predicted in dimensions $D &gt; 3$. We report the realization of an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in four dimensions (4D), with two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones encoded in the large spin of dysprosium atoms. The non-trivial topology is evidenced by measuring a quantized electromagnetic non-linear response and observing anisotropic hyperedge modes. We also excite non-planar cyclotron motion, contrasting with its circular equivalents in $D\leq3$. Our work opens to the investigation of strongly-correlated topological liquids in 4D generalizing fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Stable-fixed-point description of square-pattern formation in driven two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate pattern formation in two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) caused by periodic driving of the interatomic interaction. We show that this modulation generically leads to a stable square grid density pattern, due to nonlinear effects beyond the initial Faraday instability. We take the amplitudes of two waves parametrizing the two-dimensional density pattern as order parameters in pattern formation. For these amplitudes, we derive a set of coupled time evolution equations from the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a time-periodic interaction. We identify the fixed points of the time evolution and show by stability analysis that the inhomogeneous density exhibits a square grid pattern, which can be understood as a manifestation of a stable fixed point. Our stability analysis establishes the pattern in BECs as a nonequilibrium steady state.</description>

      <title>Gas-to-soliton transition of attractive bosons on a spherical surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state properties of $N$ bosons with attractive zero-range interactions characterized by the scattering length $a&gt;0$ and confined to the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. We present the analytic solution of the problem for $N=2$, mean-field analysis for $N\rightarrow \infty$, and exact diffusion Monte-Carlo results for intermediate $N$. For finite $N$, we observe a smooth crossover from the uniform state in the limit $a/R\gg 1$ (weak attraction) to a localized state at small $a/R$ (strong attraction). With increasing $N$ this crossover narrows down to a discontinuous transition from the uniform state to a soliton of size $\sim R/\sqrt{N}$. The two states are separated by an energy barrier, tunneling under which is exponentially suppressed at large $N$. The system behavior is marked by a peculiar competition between space-curvature effects and beyond-mean-field terms, both breaking the scaling invariance of a two-dimensional mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Semi-vortex solitons and their excited states in spin-orbit-coupled binary bosonic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that two-dimensional two-component fundamental solitons of the semi-vortex (SV) type, with vorticities $(s_{+},s_{-})=(0,1)$ in their components, are stable ground states (GSs) in the spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) binary Bose-Einstein condensate with the contact self-attraction acting in both components, in spite of the possibility of the critical collapse in the system. However, excited states(ESs) of the SV solitons, with the vorticity set $(s_{+},s_{-})=( S_{+},S_{+}+1)$ and $S_{+}=1,2,3,...$, are unstable in the same system. We construct ESs of SV solitons in the SOC system with opposite signs of the self-interaction in the two components. The main finding is stability of the ES-SV solitons, with the extra vorticity (at least) up to $S_{+}=6$. The threshold value of the norm for the onset of the critical collapse, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$, in these excited states is higher than the commonly known critical value, $N_{c}\approx 5.85$,associated with the single-component Townes solitons, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$ increasing with the growth of $S_{+}$. A velocity interval for stable motion of the GS-SV solitons is found too. The results suggest a solution for the challenging problem of the creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges.</description>

      <title>Weak integrability breaking perturbations of integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum integrable system slightly perturbed away from integrability is typically expected to thermalize on timescales of order $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength. We here study classes of perturbations that violate this scaling, and exhibit much longer thermalization times $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2\ell}$ where $\ell&gt;1$ is an integer. Systems with these "weak integrability breaking" perturbations have an extensive number of quasi-conserved quantities that commute with the perturbed Hamiltonian up to corrections of order $\lambda^\ell$. We demonstrate a systematic construction to obtain families of such weak perturbations of a generic integrable model for arbitrary $\ell$. We then apply the construction to various models, including the Heisenberg, XXZ, and XYZ chains, the Hubbard model, models of spinless free fermions, and the quantum Ising chain. Our analytical framework explains the previously observed evidence of weak integrability breaking in the Heisenberg and XXZ chains under certain perturbations.</description>

      <title>Order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice. In the low-field limit we derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by an order-by-disorder scenario. We support our analysis by studying the gap-closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For $J_2&gt;J_3$, we find a columnar phase at low fields, followed by a clock-ordered phase stabilized by resonating plaquettes at intermediate field values, and an emergent 3d-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field phase. For $J_3&gt;J_2$, an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct $k=(0,0)$ order and a quantum phase transition in the 3d-Ising universality class is observed. Further, we discuss the possible implementation of the columnar- and clock-ordered phase in existing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. When taking into account the full algebraically decaying long-range interactions on the ruby lattice, we find that long-range interactions favor the same ground state as the quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse field, which could make the ruby lattice a promising candidate for the realization of a clock-ordered phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design variational pulse sequences tailored for neutral atom quantum simulators and show that we can engineer layers of single-qubit and multi-qubit gates. As an application, we discuss how the proposed method can be used to perform refocusing algorithms, SWAP networks, and ultimately quantum chemistry simulations. While the theoretical protocol we develop still has experimental limitations, it paves the way, with some further optimisation, for the use of analog quantum processors for variational quantum algorithms, including those not previously considered compatible with analog mode.</description>
