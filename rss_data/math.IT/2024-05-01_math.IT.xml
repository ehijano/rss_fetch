      <title>Timely Status Updates in Slotted ALOHA Network With Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</description>

      <title>Transmit Power Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient Internet of Things networks use low-cost, low-power backscatter tags in various industry applications. By exploiting those tags, we introduce the integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system, featuring multiple backscatter tags, a user (reader), and a full-duplex base station (BS) that integrates sensing and (backscatter) communications. The BS undertakes dual roles of detecting backscatter tags and communicating with the user, leveraging the same temporal and frequency resources. The tag-reflected BS signals offer data to the user and enable the BS to sense the environment simultaneously. We derive both user and tag communication rates and the sensing rate of the BS. We jointly optimize the transmit/received beamformers and tag reflection coefficients to minimize the total BS power. To solve this problem, we employ the alternating optimization technique. We offer a closed-form solution for the received beamformers while utilizing semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization for transmit beamformers and power reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, with ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS, ISABC delivers a 75% sum communication and sensing rates gain over a traditional backscatter while requiring a 3.4% increase in transmit power. Furthermore, ISABC with active tags only requires a 0.24% increase in transmit power over conventional integrated sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access (MA) schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two types of data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Foundation of Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On July 5, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced four possible post-quantum cryptography standards, three of them are based on lattice theory and the other one is based on Hash function. It is well-known that the security of the lattice cryptography relies on the hardness of the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). In fact, the SVP is a sphere packing problem and the CVP is a sphere covering problem. Furthermore, both SVP and CVP are equivalent to arithmetic problems of positive definite quadratic forms. This paper will briefly introduce the post-quantum cryptography and show its connections with sphere packing, sphere covering, and positive definite quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Pilot Contamination in Massive MIMO Systems: Challenges and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple input multiple output (M-MIMO) technology plays a pivotal role in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond communication systems, offering a wide range of benefits, from increased spectral efficiency (SE) to enhanced energy efficiency and higher reliability. However, these advantages are contingent upon precise channel state information (CSI) availability at the base station (BS). Ensuring precise CSI is challenging due to the constrained size of the coherence interval and the resulting limitations on pilot sequence length. Therefore, reusing pilot sequences in adjacent cells introduces pilot contamination, hindering SE enhancement. This paper reviews recent advancements and addresses research challenges in mitigating pilot contamination and improving channel estimation, categorizing the existing research into three broader categories: pilot assignment schemes, advanced signal processing methods, and advanced channel estimation techniques. Salient representative pilot mitigation/assignment techniques are analyzed and compared in each category. Lastly, possible future research directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Information-Directed Sampling Algorithms for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work designs and analyzes a novel set of algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based on the principle of information-directed sampling (IDS). These algorithms draw inspiration from foundational concepts in information theory, and are proven to be sample efficient in MARL settings such as two-player zero-sum Markov games (MGs) and multi-player general-sum MGs. For episodic two-player zero-sum MGs, we present three sample-efficient algorithms for learning Nash equilibrium. The basic algorithm, referred to as MAIDS, employs an asymmetric learning structure where the max-player first solves a minimax optimization problem based on the joint information ratio of the joint policy, and the min-player then minimizes the marginal information ratio with the max-player's policy fixed. Theoretical analyses show that it achieves a Bayesian regret of tilde{O}(sqrt{K}) for K episodes. To reduce the computational load of MAIDS, we develop an improved algorithm called Reg-MAIDS, which has the same Bayesian regret bound while enjoying less computational complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the flexibility of IDS principle in choosing the learning target, we propose two methods for constructing compressed environments based on rate-distortion theory, upon which we develop an algorithm Compressed-MAIDS wherein the learning target is a compressed environment. Finally, we extend Reg-MAIDS to multi-player general-sum MGs and prove that it can learn either the Nash equilibrium or coarse correlated equilibrium in a sample efficient manner.</description>

      <title>QML-IB: Quantized Collaborative Intelligence between Multiple Devices and the Mobile Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile networks is regarded as one of the most important scenarios for 6G. In 6G, a major objective is to realize the efficient transmission of task-relevant data. Then a key problem arises, how to design collaborative AI models for the device side and the network side, so that the transmitted data between the device and the network is efficient enough, which means the transmission overhead is low but the AI task result is accurate. In this paper, we propose the multi-link information bottleneck (ML-IB) scheme for such collaborative models design. We formulate our problem based on a novel performance metric, which can evaluate both task accuracy and transmission overhead. Then we introduce a quantizer that is adjustable in the quantization bit depth, amplitudes, and breakpoints. Given the infeasibility of calculating our proposed metric on high-dimensional data, we establish a variational upper bound for this metric. However, due to the incorporation of quantization, the closed form of the variational upper bound remains uncomputable. Hence, we employ the Log-Sum Inequality to derive an approximation and provide a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we devise the quantized multi-link information bottleneck (QML-IB) algorithm for collaborative AI models generation. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our QML-IB algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access: Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with a massive number of unsourced and uncoordinated users. In the proposed model, known as the unsourced ISAC system (UNISAC), all active communication and sensing users share a short frame to transmit their signals, without requiring scheduling with the base station (BS). Hence, the signal received from each user is affected by significant interference from numerous interfering users, making it challenging to extract the transmitted signals. UNISAC aims to decode the transmitted message sequences from communication users while simultaneously detect active sensing users, regardless of the identity of the decoded and detected users. In this paper, we derive an achievable performance limit for UNISAC and demonstrate its superiority over conventional approaches such as ALOHA, time-division multiple access, treating interference as noise, and multiple signal classification. Through numerical simulations, we validate the UNISAC's effectiveness in detecting and decoding a large number of users.</description>

      <title>AoI-aware Sensing Scheduling and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV-assisted Wireless Backscatter Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist sensing data transmissions from the ground users (GUs) to a remote base station (BS). Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Compute-Forward Multiple Access for Gaussian Fast Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compute-forward multiple access (CFMA) is a transmission strategy which allows the receiver in a multiple access channel (MAC) to first decode linear combinations of the transmitted signals and then solve for individual messages. Compared to existing MAC strategies such as joint decoding or successive interference cancellation (SIC), CFMA was shown to achieve the MAC capacity region for fixed channels under certain signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions without time-sharing using only single-user decoders. This paper studies the CFMA scheme for a two-user Gaussian fast fading MAC with channel state information only available at the receiver (CSIR). We develop appropriate lattice decoding schemes for the fading MAC and derive the achievable rate pairs for decoding linear combinations of codewords with any integer coefficients. We give a sufficient and necessary condition under which the proposed scheme can achieve the ergodic sum capacity. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of channel statistics on the capacity achievability of the CFMA scheme. In general, the sum capacity is achievable if the channel variance is small compared to the mean value of the channel strengths. Various numerical results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a dynamic decision-making scenario where at every stage the investor has to choose between investing in one of two projects or gathering more information. At each stage, the investor may seek counsel from one of several consultants, who, for a fixed cost, provide partial information about the realized state. We explore the optimal strategy and its dependence on the belief and the consultation cost. Our analysis reveals that if one of the consultants discloses the state with a nonzero probability, this consultant will be used in any optimal strategy, provided the consultation cost is sufficiently small.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the type-based multiple access framework proposed by Mergen and Tong (2006) to the case of unsourced multiple access. In the proposed framework, each device tracks the state of a physical/digital process, quantizes this state, and communicates it to a common receiver through a shared channel in an uncoordinated manner. The receiver aims to estimate the type of the states, i.e., the set of states and their multiplicity in the sequence of states reported by all devices. We measure the type estimation error using the Wasserstein distance. Considering an example of multi-target position tracking, we show that type estimation can be performed effectively via approximate message passing. Furthermore, we determine the quantization resolution that minimizes the type estimation error by balancing quantization distortion and communication error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EVENODD+ codes are binary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes for correcting double disk failures in RAID-6 with asymptotically optimal encoding/decoding/update complexities. However, the number of bits stored in each disk of EVENODD+ codes should be an odd number minus one. In this paper, we present a new construction of EVENODD+ codes that have more flexible parameters. The number of bits stored in each disk of our codes is an odd minus one times any positive integer. Moreover, our codes not only have asymptotically optimal encoding/decoding/update complexities but also have lower encoding/decoding/update complexities than the existing EVENODD+ codes.</description>

      <title>Novel Round Trip Time Estimation in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth generation new radio (5G NR) technology is expected to fulfill reliable and accurate positioning requirements of industry use cases, such as autonomous robots, connected vehicles, and future factories. Starting from Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release-16, several enhanced positioning solutions are featured in the 5G standards, including the multi-cell round trip time (multi-RTT) method. This work presents a novel framework to estimate the round-trip time (RTT) between a user equipment (UE) and a base station (gNB) in 5G NR. Unlike the existing scheme in the standards, RTT can be estimated without the need to send timing measurements from both the gNB and UE to a central node. The proposed method relies on obtaining multiple coherent uplink wide-band channel measurements at the gNB by circumventing the timing advance control loops and the clock drift. The performance is evaluated through experiments leveraging a real world 5G testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). Under a moderate system bandwidth of 40MHz, the experimental results show meter level range accuracy even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</description>

      <title>Scale-Robust Timely Asynchronous Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an asynchronous decentralized learning system, which consists of a network of connected devices trying to learn a machine learning model without any centralized parameter server. The users in the network have their own local training data, which is used for learning across all the nodes in the network. The learning method consists of two processes, evolving simultaneously without any necessary synchronization. The first process is the model update, where the users update their local model via a fixed number of stochastic gradient descent steps. The second process is model mixing, where the users communicate with each other via randomized gossiping to exchange their models and average them to reach consensus. In this work, we investigate the staleness criteria for such a system, which is a sufficient condition for convergence of individual user models. We show that for network scaling, i.e., when the number of user devices $n$ is very large, if the gossip capacity of individual users scales as $\Omega(\log n)$, we can guarantee the convergence of user models in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the bounded staleness can only be guaranteed by any distributed opportunistic scheme by $\Omega(n)$ scaling.</description>

      <title>A Joint Communication and Computation Design for Distributed RISs Assisted Probabilistic Semantic Communication in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of spectral-efficient communication and computation resource allocation for distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is investigated. In the considered model, multiple RISs are deployed to serve multiple users, while PSC adopts compute-then-transmit protocol to reduce the transmission data size. To support high-rate transmission, the semantic compression ratio, transmit power allocation, and distributed RISs deployment must be jointly considered. This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum semantic-aware transmission rate of the system under total transmit power, phase shift, RIS-user association, and semantic compression ratio constraints. To solve this problem, a many-to-many matching scheme is proposed to solve the RIS-user association subproblem, the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed following greedy policy, while the phase shift of RIS can be optimized using the tensor based beamforming. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Enhancement of Lossless Image Compression in JPEG-XL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for digital information grows in fields like medicine, remote sensing, and archival, efficient image compression becomes crucial. This paper focuses on lossless image compression, vital for managing the increasing volume of image data without quality loss. Current research emphasizes techniques such as predictive coding, transform coding, and context modeling to improve compression ratios. This study evaluates lossless compression in JPEG XL, the latest standard in the JPEG family, and aims to enhance its compression ratio by modifying the codebase. Results show that while overall compression levels are below the original codec, one prediction method improves compression for specific image types. This study offers insights into enhancing lossless compression performance and suggests possibilities for future advancements in this area.</description>

      <title>Smart Pilot Assignment for IoT in Massive MIMO Systems: A Path Towards Scalable IoT Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G sets the foundation for an era of creativity with its faster speeds, increased data throughput, reduced latency, and enhanced IoT connectivity, all enabled by Massive MIMO (M-MIMO) technology. M-MIMO boosts network efficiency and enhances user experience by employing intelligent user scheduling. This paper presents a user scheduling scheme and pilot assignment strategy designed for IoT devices, emphasizing mitigating pilot contamination, a key obstacle to improving spectral efficiency (SE) and system scalability in M-MIMO networks. We utilize a user clustering-based pilot allocation scheme to boost IoT device scalability in M-MIMO systems. Additionally, our smart pilot allocation minimizes interference and enhances SE by treating pilot assignment as a graph coloring problem, optimizing it through integer linear programming (ILP). Recognizing the computational complexity of ILP, we introduced a binary search-based heuristic predicated on interference threshold to expedite the computation, while maintaining a near-optimal solution. The simulation results show a significant decrease in the required pilot overhead (about 17%), and substantial enhancement in SE (about 8-14%).</description>

      <title>Optimal tradeoffs for estimating Pauli observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of Pauli shadow tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, estimate $\text{tr}(P\rho)$ for some set of Pauli operators $P$ to within additive error $\epsilon$. This has been a popular testbed for exploring the advantage of protocols with quantum memory over those without: with enough memory to measure two copies at a time, one can use Bell sampling to estimate $|\text{tr}(P\rho)|$ for all $P$ using $O(n/\epsilon^4)$ copies, but with $k\le n$ qubits of memory, $\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ copies are needed.
  These results leave open several natural questions. How does this picture change in the physically relevant setting where one only needs to estimate a certain subset of Paulis? What is the optimal dependence on $\epsilon$? What is the optimal tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity?
  We answer all of these questions. For any subset $A$ of Paulis and any family of measurement strategies, we completely characterize the optimal sample complexity, up to $\log |A|$ factors. We show any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements must make $\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ measurements. For any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements and only has $k &lt; n$ qubits of memory, we show that $\widetilde{\Theta}(\min\{2^n/\epsilon^2, 2^{n-k}/\epsilon^4\})$ copies are necessary and sufficient.
  The protocols we propose can also estimate the actual values $\text{tr}(P\rho)$, rather than just their absolute values as in prior work. Additionally, as a byproduct of our techniques, we establish tight bounds for the task of purity testing and show that it exhibits an intriguing phase transition not present in the memory-sample tradeoff for Pauli shadow tomography.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Round-Robin Allocation with Potentially Noisy Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of a fundamental algorithm for fairly allocating indivisible items, the round-robin algorithm. For $n$ agents and $m$ items, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in time $O(nm\log(m/n))$ in the worst case. If the agents' preferences are uniformly random, we establish an improved (expected) running time of $O(nm + m\log m)$. On the other hand, assuming comparison queries between items, we prove that $\Omega(nm + m\log m)$ queries are necessary to implement the algorithm, even when randomization is allowed. We also derive bounds in noise models where the answers to queries are incorrect with some probability. Our proofs involve novel applications of tools from multi-armed bandit, information theory, as well as posets and linear extensions.</description>

      <title>Radio Resource Management Design for RSMA: Optimization of Beamforming, User Admission, and Discrete/Continuous Rates with Imperfect SIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the radio resource management (RRM) design for multiuser rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), accounting for various characteristics of practical wireless systems, such as the use of discrete rates, the inability to serve all users, and the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Specifically, failure to consider these characteristics in RRM design may lead to inefficient use of radio resources. Therefore, we formulate the RRM of RSMA as optimization problems to maximize respectively the weighted sum rate (WSR) and weighted energy efficiency (WEE), and jointly optimize the beamforming, user admission, discrete/continuous rates, accounting for imperfect SIC, which result in nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs that are challenging to solve. Despite the difficulty of the optimization problems, we develop algorithms that can find high-quality solutions. We show via simulations that carefully accounting for the aforementioned characteristics, can lead to significant gains. Precisely, by considering that transmission rates are discrete, the transmit power can be utilized more intelligently, allocating just enough power to guarantee a given discrete rate. Additionally, we reveal that user admission plays a crucial role in RSMA, enabling additional gains compared to random admission by facilitating the servicing of selected users with mutually beneficial channel characteristics. Furthermore, provisioning for possibly imperfect SIC makes RSMA more robust and reliable.</description>

      <title>Secure SWIPT in the Multiuser STAR-RIS Aided MISO Rate Splitting Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a novel technology that provides 360 coverage and new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). They are also capable of manipulating signal propagation and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This paper introduces a novel STAR-RIS-aided secure SWIPT system for downlink multiple input single output rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). The UERs are also capable of wiretapping the IR streams. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the information transmitter, but only imperfect CSI for the UERs is available at the energy transmitter. By exploiting RSMA, the base station splits the messages of the IRs into common and private parts. The former is encoded into a common stream that can be decoded by all IRs, while the private messages are individually decoded by their respective IRs. We find the precoders and STAR-RIS configuration that maximizes the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate of the IRs under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs, and subject to constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is non-convex and has intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-step iterative algorithm based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the RSMA-based algorithm implemented with a STAR-RIS enhances both the rate of confidential information transmission and the total spectral efficiency. Furthermore, our method surpasses the performance of both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-OMA (NOMA).</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Interpretable Neural Learning based on Local Information-Theoretic Goal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of biological and artificial networks, an intuitive understanding of how their local learning dynamics contribute to network-level task solutions remains a challenge to this date. Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce 'infomorphic' neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Stop-Feedback Coding for Minimum Age of Incorrect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) is studied within the context of remote monitoring a Markov source using variable-length stop-feedback (VLSF) coding. Leveraging recent results on the non-asymptotic channel coding rate, we consider sources with small cardinality, where feedback is non-instantaneous as the transmitted information and feedback message have comparable lengths. We focus on the feedback sequence, i.e. the times of feedback transmissions, and derive AoII-optimal and delay-optimal feedback sequences. Our results showcase the impact of the feedback sequence on the AoII, revealing that a lower average delay does not necessarily correspond to a lower average AoII. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for coding scheme design.</description>

      <title>The replica-symmetric free energy for Ising spin glasses with orthogonally invariant couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (S-K) spin glass model with external field, where the random symmetric couplings matrix does not consist of i.i.d. entries but is instead orthogonally invariant in law. For sufficiently high temperature, we prove a replica-symmetric formula for the first-order limit of the model free energy. Our analysis is an adaptation of a conditional second-moment-method argument previously introduced by Bolthausen for studying the high-temperature regime of the S-K model, where one conditions on the iterates of an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for solving the TAP equations for the model magnetization. We apply this method using a memory-free version of AMP that is tailored to the orthogonally invariant structure of the model couplings.</description>
