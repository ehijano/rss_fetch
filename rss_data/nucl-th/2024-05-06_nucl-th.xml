      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of capture thresholds with time dependent Hartree-Fock theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the time dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, capture thresholds $E_{\rm cap}$ for 144 fusion systems with nearly spherical nuclei are systematically studied for the first time. We find that for the reactions between doubly-magic nuclei, the calculated $E_{\rm cap}$ are very close to the extracted barrier heights from measured fusion excitation functions. For the fusion reactions with nearly spherical nuclei, an excitation energy of about 1 MeV at the capture position need to be considered to better reproduce the data due to the lower excitation threshold. The rms deviation with respect to the barrier heights is only 1.43 MeV from the TDHF calcualtions, which is smaller than the results from three empirical nuclear potentials. Together with Siwek-Wilczy\'{n}ski formula in which the three parameters are determined by the TDHF calculations, the measured fusion cross sections at energies around the barriers can be well reproduced for seven fusion reactions $^{40}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca, $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb, $^{40}$Ca+$^{90,96}$Zr, $^{28}$Si+$^{96}$Zr and $^{132}$Sn+$^{40,48}$Ca.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of dilute nuclear matter with light clusters and in-medium effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dilute systems composed of nucleons and light clusters within a linear response approach, taking into account the in-medium Mott effects on cluster appearance, through a density-dependent momentum cut-off. We find that spinodal instabilities and associated growth rates are severely affected by the presence of light clusters and, in particular, by the treatment of in-medium effects, foreshadowing intriguing consequences for fragment formation in heavy-ion collisions and in the broader astrophysical context.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the flow harmonic correlations via multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport coefficients than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Response of strongly coupled fermions on classical and quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the response of quantum systems is essential for gaining deeper insights into the fundamental nature of matter and its behavior in diverse physical contexts. Computation of nuclear response is critical for many applications, but its spectroscopically accurate description in medium-heavy nuclei in wide energy ranges remains particularly challenging because of the complex nature of nuclear quantum states in the high-level-density regime. Herein, we push the limits of configuration complexity in the classical computation of the nuclear response and present an algorithm with a quantum benefit for treating complex configurations. The classical computational method of approaching spectroscopic accuracy is implemented for medium-heavy nuclei and pioneered for the dipole response of 120Sn, while the quantum algorithm reaching the exact solution is realized for the Lipkin Hamiltonian to unravel the emergence of collectivity at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Intriguing aspects of light baryon resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss that some light baryon resonances exhibit properties which cannot be described when attributing a three-valence quark structure to them. Besides pointing out the hadron resonances which clearly require description beyond the quark model, we focus on the third $s_{11},~ N^*$ state and its decay to final states consisting of the lightest hyperon resonances which have a partial width comparable to that for the decay to $\pi N$. Such properties of the mentioned nucleon resonance get manifested in the cross sections and other observables related to processes producing the lightest hyperon resonances. We show that all these findings arise from the strong association of the baryon resonances to the dynamics among the ground-state hadrons.</description>

      <title>$\Upsilon$ absorption cross sections by nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2923</link>
      <description>arXiv:1309.2923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross sections of $\Upsilon $\ absorption by nucleons are calculated in meson-baryon exchange model using an effective hadronic Lagrangian. Calculated cross sections are found to peak near threshold followed by an increase which tends to settle at large center of mass energy. Peak values are found in range about 1.8 to 4 mb when cutoff parameter of monopole form factor is varied from 1.2 to 1.8 GeV. The results disagree with pQCD calculations but are consistent with the effective value of the absorption cross section extracted from p-A scattering data in E772 experiment at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=39$ GeV. We use this data value to find a best fit of the cutoff parameter which enables us provide definite predictions for the values of $\Upsilon $ absorption cross sections by nucleons for upcoming p-A scattering experiments at RHIC and LHC energies for zero rapidity $b\bar{b}$ states. The results could be useful in studying the effect of $\Upsilon $ absorption by nucleons at its production stage in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. We also find that thermal averaged values of total absorption cross sections are small enough to rule out the effect of absorption of $\Upsilon $ by the comovers in the hadronic matter.</description>

      <title>Global data-driven determination of baryon transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic nuclear reduction for tensor couplings in dark matter direct detection and $\mu \to e$ conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nonrelativistic Effective Theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study bridges this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. We find additional operators in the $\mu \to e$ conversion that are not present in the scalar and vector couplings. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

      <title>Go Green: Selected Configuration Interaction as a More Sustainable Alternative for High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new distributed implementation of the full configuration interaction (FCI) method has been reported [Gao et al. J. Chem Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 1185]. Thanks to a hybrid parallelization scheme, the authors were able to compute the exact energy of propane (\ce{C3H8}) in the minimal basis STO-3G. This formidable task involves handling an active space of 26 electrons in 23 orbitals or a Hilbert space of \SI{1.3d12} determinants. This is, by far, the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Here, we illustrate how, from a general point of view, selected configuration interaction (SCI) can achieve microhartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational and memory cost, via a sparse exploration of the FCI space. The present SCI calculations are performed with the \textit{Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively} (CIPSI) algorithm, as implemented in a determinant-driven way in the \textsc{quantum package} software. The present study reinforces the common wisdom that among the exponentially large number of determinants in the FCI space, only a tiny fraction of them significantly contribute to the energy. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of achieving comparable accuracy using more reasonable and sustainable computational resources, hence reducing the ever-growing carbon footprint of computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>
