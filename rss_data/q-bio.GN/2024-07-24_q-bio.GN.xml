      <title>LSTM Autoencoder-based Deep Neural Networks for Barley Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key driver of precision agriculture, facilitating enhanced crop productivity, optimized resource use, farm sustainability, and informed decision-making. Also, the expansion of genome sequencing technology has greatly increased crop genomic resources, deepening our understanding of genetic variation and enhancing desirable crop traits to optimize performance in various environments. There is increasing interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction due to their excellence in capturing complex interactions within large, high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we propose a new LSTM autoencoder-based model for barley genotype-to-phenotype prediction, specifically for flowering time and grain yield estimation, which could potentially help optimize yields and management practices. Our model outperformed the other baseline methods, demonstrating its potential in handling complex high-dimensional agricultural datasets and enhancing crop phenotype prediction performance.</description>

      <title>GV-Rep: A Large-Scale Dataset for Genetic Variant Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data. This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management. To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged. However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations. This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs? We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges. We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients. (ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. (iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs. The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation. We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap.</description>

      <title>scGHSOM: Hierarchical clustering and visualization of single-cell and CRISPR data using growing hierarchical SOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional single-cell data poses significant challenges in identifying underlying biological patterns due to the complexity and heterogeneity of cellular states. We propose a comprehensive gene-cell dependency visualization via unsupervised clustering, Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM), specifically designed for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data like single-cell sequencing and CRISPR screens. GHSOM is applied to cluster samples in a hierarchical structure such that the self-growth structure of clusters satisfies the required variations between and within. We propose a novel Significant Attributes Identification Algorithm to identify features that distinguish clusters. This algorithm pinpoints attributes with minimal variation within a cluster but substantial variation between clusters. These key attributes can then be used for targeted data retrieval and downstream analysis. Furthermore, we present two innovative visualization tools: Cluster Feature Map and Cluster Distribution Map. The Cluster Feature Map highlights the distribution of specific features across the hierarchical structure of GHSOM clusters. This allows for rapid visual assessment of cluster uniqueness based on chosen features. The Cluster Distribution Map depicts leaf clusters as circles on the GHSOM grid, with circle size reflecting cluster data size and color customizable to visualize features like cell type or other attributes. We apply our analysis to three single-cell datasets and one CRISPR dataset (cell-gene database) and evaluate clustering methods with internal and external CH and ARI scores. GHSOM performs well, being the best performer in internal evaluation (CH=4.2). In external evaluation, GHSOM has the third-best performance of all methods.</description>

      <title>Supervised machine learning for microbiomics: bridging the gap between current and best practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is set to accelerate innovations in clinical microbiomics, such as in disease diagnostics and prognostics. This will require high-quality, reproducible, interpretable workflows whose predictive capabilities meet or exceed the high thresholds set for clinical tools by regulatory agencies. Here, we capture a snapshot of current practices in the application of supervised ML to microbiomics data, through an in-depth analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles published in 2021-2022. We apply a data-driven approach to steer discussion of the merits of varied approaches to experimental design, including key considerations such as how to mitigate the effects of small dataset size while avoiding data leakage. We further provide guidance on how to avoid common experimental design pitfalls that can hurt model performance, trustworthiness, and reproducibility. Discussion is accompanied by an interactive online tutorial that demonstrates foundational principles of ML experimental design, tailored to the microbiomics community. Formalizing community best practices for supervised ML in microbiomics is an important step towards improving the success and efficiency of clinical research, to the benefit of patients and other stakeholders.</description>

      <title>scVGAE: A Novel Approach using ZINB-Based Variational Graph Autoencoder for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study individual cellular distinctions and uncover unique cell characteristics. However, a significant technical challenge in scRNA-seq analysis is the occurrence of "dropout" events, where certain gene expressions cannot be detected. This issue is particularly pronounced in genes with low or sparse expression levels, impacting the precision and interpretability of the obtained data. To address this challenge, various imputation methods have been implemented to predict such missing values, aiming to enhance the analysis's accuracy and usefulness. A prevailing hypothesis posits that scRNA-seq data conforms to a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution. Consequently, methods have been developed to model the data according to this distribution. Recent trends in scRNA-seq analysis have seen the emergence of deep learning approaches. Some techniques, such as the variational autoencoder, incorporate the ZINB distribution as a model loss function. Graph-based methods like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have also gained attention as deep learning methodologies for scRNA-seq analysis. This study introduces scVGAE, an innovative approach integrating GCN into a variational autoencoder framework while utilizing a ZINB loss function. This integration presents a promising avenue for effectively addressing dropout events in scRNA-seq data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of downstream analyses. scVGAE outperforms other methods in cell clustering, with the best performance in 11 out of 14 datasets. Ablation study shows all components of scVGAE are necessary. scVGAE is implemented in Python and downloadable at https://github.com/inoue0426/scVGAE.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler; https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>
