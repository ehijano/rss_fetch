      <title>Beyond Uptime: Actionable Performance Metrics for EV Charging Site Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Attenuation Regulator I-A: Signal Bound Finite Horizon Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to signal bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences whose squared signal two-norm is bounded by a fixed budget. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $\alpha$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\mathcal{X}_L(\alpha)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\mathcal{X}_{NL}(\alpha)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear. We establish monotonicity and boundedness of the associated Riccati recursions and characterize the geometry of the solution regions. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical properties.
  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the finite horizon SiDAR for arbitrary initial states. Companion papers address the steady-state problem and convergence properties for the signal bound case, and the stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR).</description>

      <title>Disturbance Attenuation Regulator I-B: Signal Bound Convergence and Steady-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes convergence and steady-state properties for the signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR). Building on the finite horizon recursive solution developed in a companion paper, we introduce the steady-state SiDAR and derive its tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Systems are classified as degenerate or nondegenerate based on steady-state solution properties. For nondegenerate systems, the finite horizon solution converges to the steady-state solution for all states as the horizon approaches infinity. For degenerate systems, convergence holds in one region of the state space, while a turnpike arises in the complementary region. When convergence holds, the optimal multiplier and control gain are obtained directly from the LMI solution. Numerical examples illustrate convergence behavior and turnpike phenomena.
  Companion papers address the finite horizon SiDAR solution and the stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR).</description>

      <title>Disturbance Attenuation Regulator II: Stage Bound Finite Horizon Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to stage bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences constrained independently at each time step through stagewise squared two-norm bounds. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, this work derives a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex optimization for the Lagrange multiplier vector at each stage; the control is then explicit. For systems with constant stage bound, the problem admits a steady-state optimization expressed as a tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the solution.
  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the StDAR for arbitrary initial states. Companion papers address the signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR): the finite horizon solution in Part~I-A and convergence properties in Part~I-B.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Vertical Heterogeneous Networks: A Cell Switching Approach with High Altitude Platform Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of radio access networks (RANs) is increasing energy consumption and challenging the sustainability of future systems. We consider a dense-urban vertical heterogeneous network (vHetNet) comprising a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as a super macro base station, a terrestrial macro base station (MBS), and multiple small base stations (SBSs). We propose a HAPS-enhanced cell-switching algorithm that selectively deactivates SBSs based on their traffic load and the capacity and channel conditions of both the MBS and HAPS. The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</description>

      <title>A monolithic fabrication platform for intrinsically stretchable polymer transistors and complementary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft, stretchable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) can provide powerful on-skin signal conditioning, but current fabrication methods are often material-specific: each new polymer semiconductor (PSC) requires a tailored process. The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.</description>

      <title>Determining optimal thermal energy storage charging temperature for cooling using integrated building and coil modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) systems coupled with heat pumps offer significant potential for improving building energy efficiency by shifting electricity demand to off-peak hours. However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 {\deg}C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.</description>

      <title>Solution Concepts and Existence Results for Hybrid Systems with Continuous-time Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many scenarios, it is natural to model a plant's dynamical behavior using a hybrid dynamical system influenced by exogenous continuous-time inputs. While solution concepts and analytical tools for existence and completeness are well established for autonomous hybrid systems, corresponding results for hybrid dynamical systems involving continuous-time inputs are generally lacking. This work aims to address this gap. We first formalize notions of a solution for such systems. We then provide conditions that guarantee the existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we leverage results and ideas from viability theory to present more explicit conditions in terms of various tangent cone formulations. Variants are provided that depend on the regularity of the exogenous input signals.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Full Order Observer Based Control for Spacecraft Orbit Maneuver Trajectory Under Solar Radiation Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of modern control theory to improve the precision of spacecraft orbit maneuvers in low Earth orbit under the influence of solar radiation pressure. A full order observer based feedback control framework is developed to estimate system states and compensate for external disturbances during the trajectory correction phase following main engine cut off. The maneuver trajectory is generated using Lambert guidance, while the observer based controller ensures accurate tracking of the target orbit despite SRP perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed design is assessed through stability, observability, and controllability analyses. Stability is validated by step-response simulations and eigenvalue distributions of the system dynamics. Observability is demonstrated through state matrix rank analysis, confirming complete state estimation. Controllability is verified using state feedback rank conditions and corresponding control performance plots. Comparative simulations highlight that, in contrast to uncontrolled or conventional control cases, the observer based controller achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robust disturbance rejection with moderate control effort. These findings indicate that observer-based feedback control offers a reliable and scalable solution for precision orbital maneuvering in LEO missions subject to environmental disturbances.</description>

      <title>On Data-based Nash Equilibria in LQ Nonzero-sum Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers data-based solutions of linear-quadratic nonzero-sum differential games. Two cases are considered. First, the deterministic game is solved and Nash equilibrium strategies are obtained by using persistently excited data from the multiagent system. Then, a stochastic formulation of the game is considered, where each agent measures a different noisy output signal and state observers must be designed for each player. It is shown that the proposed data-based solutions of these games are equivalent to known model-based procedures. The resulting data-based solutions are validated in a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Composite and Staged Trust Evaluation for Multi-Hop Collaborator Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop collaboration offers new perspectives for enhancing task execution efficiency by increasing available distributed collaborators for resource sharing. Consequently, selecting trustworthy collaborators becomes critical for realizing effective multi-hop collaboration. However, evaluating device trust requires the consideration of multiple factors, including relatively stable factors, such as historical interaction data, and dynamic factors, such as varying resources and network conditions. This differentiation makes it challenging to achieve the accurate evaluation of composite trust factors using one identical evaluation approach. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a composite and staged trust evaluation (CSTE) mechanism, where stable and dynamic factors are separately evaluated at different stages and then integrated for a final trust decision. First, a device interaction graph is constructed from stable historical interaction data to represent direct trust relationships between devices. A graph neural network framework is then used to propagate and aggregate these trust relationships to produce the historical trustworthiness of devices. In addition, a task-specific trust evaluation method is developed to assess the dynamic resources of devices based on task requirements, which generates the task-specific resource trustworthiness of devices. After these evaluations, CSTE integrates their results to identify devices within the network topology that satisfy the minimum trust thresholds of tasks. These identified devices then establish a trusted topology. Finally, within this trusted topology, an A* search algorithm is employed to construct a multi-hop collaboration path that satisfies the task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that CSTE outperforms the comparison algorithms in identifying paths with the highest average trust values.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning on the Edge for Sustainable IoT Networks: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has become integral to modern technology, enhancing daily life and industrial processes through seamless connectivity. However, the rapid expansion of IoT systems presents significant sustainability challenges, such as high energy consumption and inefficient resource management. Addressing these issues is critical for the long-term viability of IoT networks. Machine learning (ML), with its proven success across various domains, offers promising solutions for optimizing IoT operations. ML algorithms can learn directly from raw data, uncovering hidden patterns and optimizing processes in dynamic environments. Executing ML at the edge of IoT networks can further enhance sustainability by reducing bandwidth usage, enabling real-time decision-making, and improving data privacy. Additionally, testing ML models on actual hardware is essential to ensure satisfactory performance under real-world conditions, as it captures the complexities and constraints of real-world IoT deployments. Combining ML at the edge and actual hardware testing, therefore, increases the reliability of ML models to effectively improve the sustainability of IoT systems. The present systematic literature review explores how ML can be utilized to enhance the sustainability of IoT networks, examining current methodologies, benefits, challenges, and future opportunities. Through our analysis, we aim to provide insights that will drive future innovations in making IoT networks more sustainable.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Shrinking Disturbance-Invariant Tubes for State- and Input-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a learning-based framework for constructing shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes under state- and input-dependent uncertainty, intended as a building block for tube Model Predictive Control (MPC), and certify safety via a lifted, isotone (order-preserving) fixed-point map. Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors become $(1-\alpha)$ credible ellipsoids, then polytopic outer sets for deterministic set operations. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\star\!\subseteq\!\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance.</description>

      <title>Implications of Grid-Forming Inverter Parameters on Disturbance Localization and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Approximately Optimal Global Planning for Contact-Rich SE(2) Manipulation on a Graph of Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Balanced allocation: considerations from large scale service environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study d-way balanced allocation, which assigns each incoming job to the lightest loaded among d randomly chosen servers. While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:
  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.
  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results.</description>

      <title>Secure Data Bridging in Industry 4.0: An OPC UA Aggregation Approach for Including Insecure Legacy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased connectivity of industrial networks has led to a surge in cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for cybersecurity measures tailored to the specific requirements of industrial systems. Modern Industry 4.0 technologies, such as OPC UA, offer enhanced resilience against these threats. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to long installation times, proprietary technology, restricted flexibility, and formal process requirements (e.g. safety certifications). Consequently, many systems do not yet implement these technologies, or only partially. This leads to the challenge of dealing with so-called brownfield systems, which are often placed in isolated security zones to mitigate risks. However, the need for data exchange between secure and insecure zones persists.
  This paper reviews existing solutions to address this challenge by analysing their approaches, advantages, and limitations. Building on these insights, we identify three key concepts, evaluate their suitability and compatibility, and ultimately introduce the SigmaServer, a novel TCP-level aggregation method. The developed proof-of-principle implementation is evaluated in an operational technology (OT) testbed, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in bridging secure and insecure zones.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Grid Resilience: A Gradient-Free Meta-RL Framework for Critical Load Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Monitoring of Stochastic Fire Front Processes via Information-seeking Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.</description>

      <title>Distributed Control Barrier Functions for Safe Multi-Vehicle Navigation in Heterogeneous USV Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance in heterogeneous fleets of uncrewed vessels is challenging because the decision-making processes and controllers often differ between platforms, and it is further complicated by the limitations on sharing trajectories and control values in real-time. This paper presents a pragmatic approach that addresses these issues by adding a control filter on each autonomous vehicle that assumes worst-case behavior from other contacts, including crewed vessels. This distributed safety control filter is developed using control barrier function (CBF) theory and the application is clearly described to ensure explainability of these safety-critical methods. This work compares the worst-case CBF approach with a Collision Regulations (COLREGS) behavior-based approach in simulated encounters. Real-world experiments with three different uncrewed vessels and a human operated vessel were performed to confirm the approach is effective across a range of platforms and is robust to uncooperative behavior from human operators. Results show that combining both CBF methods and COLREGS behaviors achieves the best safety and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement-Learning-Based Power Control for Application-Agnostic Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.</description>

Abstract: The development of robust learning-based control algorithms for unstable systems requires high-quality, real-world data, yet access to specialized robotic hardware remains a significant barrier for many researchers. This paper introduces a comprehensive dynamics dataset for the Mini Wheelbot, an open-source, quasi-symmetric balancing reaction wheel unicycle. The dataset provides 1 kHz synchronized data encompassing all onboard sensor readings, state estimates, ground-truth poses from a motion capture system, and third-person video logs. To ensure data diversity, we include experiments across multiple hardware instances and surfaces using various control paradigms, including pseudo-random binary excitation, nonlinear model predictive control, and reinforcement learning agents. We include several example applications in dynamics model learning, state estimation, and time-series classification to illustrate common robotics algorithms that can be benchmarked on our dataset.</description>

      <title>Projection-based discrete-time consensus on the unit sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address discrete-time consensus on the Euclidean unit sphere. For this purpose we consider a distributed algorithm comprising the iterative projection of a conical combination of neighboring states. Neighborhoods are represented by a strongly connected directed graph, and the conical combinations are represented by a (non-negative) weight matrix with a zero structure corresponding to the graph. A first result mirrors earlier results for gradient flows. Under the assumptions that each diagonal element of the weight matrix is more than $\sqrt{2}$ larger than the sum of the other elements in the corresponding row, the sphere dimension is greater or equal to 2, and the graph, as well as the weight matrix, is symmetric, we show that the algorithm comprises gradient ascent, stable fixed points are consensus points, and the set of initial points for which the algorithm converges to a non-consensus fixed point has measure zero. The second result is that for the unit circle and a strongly connected graph or for any unit sphere with dimension greater than or equal to $1$ and the complete graph, only for a measure zero set of weight matrices there are fixed points for the algorithm which do not have consensus or antipodal configurations.</description>

      <title>MetaboNet: The Largest Publicly Available Consolidated Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.</description>

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM) is a well-known problem in robotics with a large range of applications. This paper presents a novel approach to VSLAM by lifting the observer design to a novel Lie group on which the system output is equivariant. The perspective gained from this analysis facilitates the design of a non-linear observer with almost semi-globally asymptotically stable error dynamics. Simulations are provided to illustrate the behaviour of the proposed observer and experiments on data gathered using a fixed-wing UAV flying outdoors demonstrate its performance.</description>

Abstract: The kinematics of many systems encountered in robotics, mechatronics, and avionics are naturally posed on homogeneous spaces; that is, their state lies in a smooth manifold equipped with a transitive Lie group symmetry. This paper proposes a novel filter, the Equivariant Filter (EqF), by posing the observer state on the symmetry group, linearising global error dynamics derived from the equivariance of the system, and applying extended Kalman filter design principles. We show that equivariance of the system output can be exploited to reduce linearisation error and improve filter performance. Simulation experiments of an example application show that the EqF significantly outperforms the extended Kalman filter and that the reduced linearisation error leads to a clear improvement in performance.</description>

      <title>Constructive Equivariant Observer Design for Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial Velocity-Aided Attitude (VAA), the estimation of the velocity and attitude of a vehicle using gyroscope, accelerometer, and inertial-frame velocity (e.g. GPS velocity) measurements, is an important problem in the control of Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS). Existing solutions provide limited stability guarantees, relying on local linearisation, high gain design, or assuming specific trajectories such as constant acceleration of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel non-linear observer for inertial VAA with almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable error dynamics. The approach exploits Lie group symmetries of the system dynamics to construct a globally valid correction term. To the authors' knowledge, this construction is the first observer to provide almost global convergence for the inertial VAA problem. The observer performance is verified in simulation, where it is shown that the estimation error converges to zero even with an extremely poor initial condition.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Linear Switched Systems with Long Constant Input Delay via Average or Averaging Predictor Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop delay-compensating feedback laws for linear switched systems with time-dependent switching. Because the future values of the switching signal, which are needed for constructing an exact predictor-feedback law, may be unavailable at current time, the key design challenge is how to construct a proper predictor state. We resolve this challenge constructing two alternative, average predictor-based feedback laws. The first is viewed as a predictor-feedback law for a particular average system, properly modified to provide exact state predictions over a horizon that depends on a minimum dwell time of the switching signal (when it is available). The second is, essentially, a modification of an average of predictor feedbacks, each one corresponding to the fixed-mode predictor-feedback law. We establish that under the control laws introduced, the closed-loop systems are (uniformly) exponentially stable, provided that the differences among system's matrices and among (nominal stabilizing) controller's gains are sufficiently small, with a size that is inversely proportional to the delay length. Since no restriction is imposed on the delay, such a limitation is inherent to the problem considered (in which the future switching signal values are unavailable), and thus, it cannot be removed. The stability proof relies on multiple Lyapunov functionals constructed via backstepping and derivation of solutions' estimates for quantifying the difference between average and exact predictor states. We present consistent numerical simulation results, which illustrate the necessity of employing the average predictor-based laws and demonstrate the performance improvement when the knowledge of a minimum dwell time is properly utilized for improving state prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scalable Sensor Placement for Cyclic Networks with Observability Guarantees: Application to Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is essential for state estimation and effective network monitoring. As known in the literature, this problem becomes particularly challenging in large-scale undirected or bidirected cyclic networks with parametric uncertainties, such as water distribution networks (WDNs), where pipe resistance and demand patterns are often unknown. Motivated by the challenges of cycles, parametric uncertainties, and scalability, this paper proposes a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees structural observability for cyclic and acyclic networks with parametric uncertainties. By leveraging a graph-based strategy, the proposed method efficiently addresses the computational complexities of large-scale networks. To demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to several EPANET benchmark WDNs. Most notably, the developed algorithm solves the sensor placement problem with guaranteed structured observability for the L-town WDN with 1694 nodes and 124 cycles in under 0.1 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to design analog electronic circuits that implement Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies for dynamical systems described by affine models. Effective approaches to define a reduced-complexity Explicit MPC form are combined and applied to realize an analog circuit comprising a limited set of low-latency, commercially available components. The practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through its application in the design of a novel MPC-based controller for DC-DC Buck converters. We formally analyze the stability of the resulting system and conduct extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the control system's performance in rejecting line and load disturbances.</description>

      <title>Off Policy Lyapunov Stability in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study state estimation for discrete-time linear stochastic systems under distributional ambiguity in the initial state, process noise, and measurement noise. We propose a noise-centric distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) based on Wasserstein ambiguity sets imposed directly on these distributions. This formulation excludes dynamically unreachable priors and yields a Kalman-type recursion driven by least-favorable covariances computed via semidefinite programs (SDP). In the time-invariant case, the steady-state DRKF is obtained from a single stationary SDP, producing a constant gain with Kalman-level online complexity. We establish the convergence of the DR Riccati covariance iteration to the stationary SDP solution, together with an explicit sufficient condition for a prescribed convergence rate. We further show that the proposed noise-centric model induces a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances and a Kalman filter sandwiching property for the DRKF covariances. Finally, we prove that the steady-state error dynamics are Schur stable, and the steady-state DRKF is asymptotically minimax optimal with respect to worst-case mean-square error.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodality: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.</description>

      <title>EqVIO: An Equivariant Filter for Visual Inertial Odometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is the problem of estimating a robot's trajectory by combining information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera, and is of great interest to the robotics community. This paper develops a novel Lie group symmetry for the VIO problem and applies the recently proposed equivariant filter. The proposed symmetry is compatible with the invariance of the VIO reference frame, leading to improved filter consistency. The bias-free IMU dynamics are group-affine, ensuring that filter linearisation errors depend only on the bias estimation error and measurement noise. Furthermore, visual measurements are equivariant with respect to the symmetry, enabling the application of the higher-order equivariant output approximation to reduce approximation error in the filter update equation. As a result, the equivariant filter (EqF) based on this Lie group is a consistent estimator for VIO with lower linearisation error in the propagation of state dynamics and a higher order equivariant output approximation than standard formulations. Experimental results on the popular EuRoC and UZH FPV datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art VIO algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.</description>

Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) are important in computation and antilinear systems. Existing research mainly focuses on the time-invariant version, while studies on the time-variant version and its solution using artificial neural networks are still lacking. This paper introduces zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) to solve the earliest time-variant CCME. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models are proposed, and their convergence and effectiveness are theoretically proved. Thirdly, numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and highlight their differences. The results show the advantages of ZND in the complex field compared with that in the real field, and further refine the related theory.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.</description>

      <title>LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach targets low probability high consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</description>
