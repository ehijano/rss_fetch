      <title>Chemically reactive and aging macromolecular mixtures II: Phase separation and coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we put forth a thermodynamic model for complex formation via a chemical reaction involving multiple macromolecular species, which may subsequently undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and a further transition into a gel-like state. In the present work, we formulate a thermodynamically consistent kinetic framework to study the interplay between phase separation, chemical reaction and aging in spatially inhomogeneous macromolecular mixtures. A numerical algorithm is also proposed to simulate domain growth from collisions of liquid and gel domains via passive Brownian motion in both two and three spatial dimensions. Our results show that the coarsening behavior is significantly influenced by the degree of gelation and Brownian motion. The presence of a gel phase inside condensates strongly limits the diffusive transport processes, and Brownian motion coalescence controls the coarsening process in systems with high area/volume fractions of gel-like condensates, leading to formation of interconnected domains with atypical domain growth rates controlled by size-dependent translational and rotational diffusivities.</description>

      <title>Passive wing deployment and retraction in beetles and flapping microrobots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birds, bats and many insects can tuck their wings against their bodies at rest and deploy them to power flight. Whereas birds and bats use well-developed pectoral and wing muscles and tendons, how insects control these movements remains unclear, as mechanisms of wing deployment and retraction vary among insect species. Beetles (Coleoptera) display one of the most complex wing mechanisms. For example, in rhinoceros beetles, the wing deployment initiates by fully opening the elytra and partially releasing the hindwings from the abdomen. Subsequently, the beetle starts flapping, elevates the hindwings at the bases, and unfolds the wingtips in an origami-like fashion. Whilst the origami-like fold have been extensively explored, limited attention has been given to the hindwing base deployment and retraction, which are believed to be driven by thoracic muscles. Using high-speed cameras and robotic flapping-wing models, here we demonstrate that rhinoceros beetles can effortlessly elevate the hindwings to flight position without the need for muscular activity. We show that opening the elytra triggers a spring-like partial release of the hindwings from the body, allowing the clearance needed for subsequent flapping motion that brings the hindwings into flight position. The results also show that after flight, beetles can leverage the elytra to push the hindwings back into the resting position, further strengthening the hypothesis of a passive deployment mechanism. Finally, we validate the hypothesis with a flapping microrobot that passively deploys its wings for stable controlled flight and retracts them neatly upon landing, which offers a simple yet effective approach to the design of insect-like flying micromachines.</description>

      <title>Minimal motifs for habituating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habituation - a phenomenon in which a dynamical system exhibits a diminishing response to repeated stimulations that eventually recovers when the stimulus is withheld - is universally observed in living systems from animals to unicellular organisms. Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this fundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from prior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study habituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to formalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally identified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework to investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In particular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with static nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous hallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive learning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating circuits in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>
