      <title>Exploring the Impact of Reflexivity Theory and Cognitive Social Structures on the Dynamics of Doctor-Patient Social System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional economic and socio-behavioural models assume perfect symmetric access to information and rational behaviour among interacting agents in a social system. However, real-world events and observations appear to contradict such assumptions, leading to the possibility of other, more complex interaction rules existing between such agents. We investigate this possibility by creating two different models for a doctor-patient system. One retains the established assumptions, while the other incorporates principles of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures. In addition, we utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behaviour of the physician and patient agents in both models. The differences in results for the two models suggest that social systems may not always exhibit the behaviour or even accomplish the purpose for which they were designed and that modelling the social and cognitive influences in a social system may capture various ways a social agent balances complementary and competing information signals in making choices.</description>

      <title>Two scholarly publishing cultures? Open access drives a divergence in European academic publishing practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current system of scholarly publishing is often criticized for being slow, expensive, and not transparent. The rise of open access publishing as part of open science tenets, promoting transparency and collaboration, together with calls for research assesment reforms are the results of these criticisms. The emergence of new open access publishers presents a unique opportunity to empirically test how universities and countries respond to shifts in the academic publishing landscape. These new actors challenge traditional publishing models, offering faster review times and broader accessibility, which could influence strategic publishing decisions.
  Our findings reveal a clear division in European publishing practices, with countries clustering into two groups distinguished by the ratio of publications in new open access journals with accelerated review times versus legacy journals. This divide underscores a broader shift in academic culture, highlighting new open access publishing venues as a strategic factor influencing national and institutional publishing practices, with significant implications for research accessibility and collaboration across Europe.</description>

      <title>Risk aversion can promote cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative dynamics are central to our understanding of many phenomena in living and complex systems. However, we lack a universal mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. We present a novel framework for modelling social dilemma games with an arbitrary number of players by combining reaction networks, methods from quantum mechanics applied to stochastic complex systems, game theory and stochastic simulations of molecular reactions. Using this framework, we propose a novel and robust mechanism for cooperation based on risk aversion that leads to cooperative behaviour in population games. Rather than individuals seeking to maximise payouts in the long run, individuals seek to obtain a minimum set of resources with a given level of confidence and in a limited time span. We show that this mechanism can lead to the emergence of new equilibria in a range of social dilemma games.</description>

      <title>A WECC-based Model for Simulating Two-stage Market Clearing with High-temporal-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source model for simulating two-stage market clearing based on the Western Electricity Coordinating Council Anchor Data Set. We model accurate two-stage market clearing with day-ahead unit commitment at hourly resolution and real-time economic dispatch with five-minute resolution. Both day-ahead unit commitment and real-time economic dispatch can incorporate look-ahead rolling horizons. The model includes seven market regions and a full year of data, detailing 2,403 individual generation assets across diverse energy sources. The year-long simulation demonstrates the capability of our model to closely reflect the generation and price patterns of the California ISO. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that extending the ED look-ahead horizon reduces system costs by up to 0.12%. We expect this new system model to fulfill the needs of conducting electricity market analysis at finer time granularity for market designs and emerging technology integration. While we focus on the western interconnection, the model serves as a base to simulate other two-stage clearing market locations.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics of Consumer Response: A Unified Framework Integrating Statistical Physics and Marketing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers react to advertising inputs is essential for marketers aiming to optimize advertising strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. This study examines the complex nature of consumer behaviour by applying theoretical frameworks derived from physics and social psychology. We present an innovative equation that captures the relation between spending on advertising and consumer response, using concepts such as symmetries, scaling laws, and phase transitions. By validating our equation against well-known models such as the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, we prove its effectiveness in accurately representing the complexity of consumer response dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of key model parameters, such as marketing effectiveness, response sensitivity, and behavioural sensitivity, in influencing consumer behaviour. The work explores the practical implications for advertisers and marketers, as well as discussing the limitations and future research directions. In summary, this study provides a thorough framework for comprehending and forecasting consumer reactions to advertising, which has implications for optimizing advertising strategies and allocating resources.</description>

      <title>Tournament design: A review from an operational research perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every sport needs rules. Tournament design refers to the rules that determine how a tournament, a series of games between a number of competitors, is organized. This study aims to provide an overview of the tournament design literature from the perspective of operational research. Three important design criteria are discussed: efficacy, fairness, and attractiveness. Our survey classifies the papers discussing these properties according to the main components of tournament design: format, seeding, draw, scheduling, and ranking. We also outline several open questions and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: a statistical theory of balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the so-called strong version of structural balance theory, actors in signed social networks avoid establishing triads with an odd number of negative links. Generalising, the weak version of balance theory allows for nodes to be partitioned into any number of blocks with positive internal links, mutually connected by negative links. If this prescription is interpreted rigidly, i.e. without allowing for statistical noise in the observed link signs, then most real graphs will appear to require a larger number of blocks than the actual one, or even to violate both versions of the theory. This might lead to conclusions invoking even more relaxed notions of balance. Here, after rephrasing structural balance theory in statistically testable terms, we propose an inference scheme to unambiguously assess whether a real-world, signed graph is balanced. We find that the proposed statistical balance theory leads to interpretations that are quite different from those derived from the current, deterministic versions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Exploring growing complex systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complex system with many interacting individuals can be represented by a network consisting of nodes and links representing individuals and pairwise interactions, respectively. However, real-world systems grow with time and include many higher-order interactions. Such systems with higher-order interactions can be well described by a simplicial complex (SC), which is a type of hypergraph, consisting of simplexes representing sets of multiple interacting nodes. Here, capturing the properties of growing real-world systems, we propose a growing random SC (GRSC) model where a node is added and a higher dimensional simplex is established among nodes at each time step. We then rigorously derive various percolation properties in the GRSC. Finally, we confirm that the system exhibits an infinite-order phase transition as higher-order interactions accelerate the growth of the system and result in the advanced emergence of a giant cluster. This work can pave the way for interpreting growing complex systems with higher-order interactions such as social, biological, brain, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Variability of Outcomes of the New Natural Daylighting Requirements in the Basque Country's Habitability Decree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Basque Country's Habitability Decree of 2022 redefines natural lighting requirements in residential spaces, increasing the Wall-to-Floor Ratio (WFR) compared to previous municipal and sectoral standards, based on the depth of the space considered. This regulatory adjustment seeks to optimize the quality of natural light, a key factor for well-being. However, the application of a geometric rule based on fixed proportions raises questions about the variability of achievable lighting results and their suitability for residential comfort needs. This study analyses the implementation of the regulation in two bedroom models, BR1 and BR2, selected as the typical and the deepest, but with less than 4 meters and meeting the rest of the dimensional requirements, respectively. Through simulations of the Daylight Factor (DF) using window proportions of 1:1, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:2 under a CIE overcast sky model, the dispersion in the obtained natural lighting has been examined. Such analysis allows for the quantification of lighting result variability within the regulatory parameters, exploring the complexity of meeting lighting requirements through an approach based exclusively on geometric proportions. Additionally, the impact of architectural and urban variables such as building height, the presence of courtyards, street width, and balcony depth has been considered. These factors, often overlooked in regulations and indirectly considered in D80/2022, play an important role in modulating natural light and lighting quality. At the end, the paper comments on the advantages and limitations of regulating natural light through arithmetic or geometric rules like the WFR, comparing this method with approaches based on detailed room-by-room analysis.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based Distributed Optimization for Multi-agent Systems over Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a more comprehensive framework for exploring real-world and engineering systems than traditional single-layer networks, consisting of multiple interacting networks. However, despite significant research in distributed optimization for single-layer networks, similar progress for multilayer systems is lacking. This paper proposes two algorithms for distributed optimization problems in multiplex networks using the supra-Laplacian matrix and its diffusion dynamics. The algorithms include a distributed saddle-point algorithm and its variation as a distributed gradient descent algorithm. By relating consensus and diffusion dynamics, we obtain the multiplex supra-Laplacian matrix. We extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm for multiplex networks using this matrix and analyze the convergence of both algorithms with several theoretical results. Numerical examples validate our proposed algorithms, and we explore the impact of interlayer diffusion on consensus time. We also present a coordinated dispatch for interdependent infrastructure networks (energy-gas) to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to real engineering problems.</description>
