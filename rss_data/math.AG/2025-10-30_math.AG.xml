      <title>A class of geometrically elliptic fibrations by plane projective quartic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fibrations by non-hyperelliptic curves of arithmetic genus three and geometric genus one in characteristic two. Assuming that there is only one moving singularity and that its image in the Frobenius pullback of the fibration has degree one over the base, we provide a complete classification up to birational equivalence. This relies on an in-depth analysis of the generic fibres, whose geometry we describe explicitly. We prove that these fibrations are covered by elliptic fibrations, and that the covers are birational on the fibres but purely inseparable of exponent one on the bases.</description>

      <title>Notes from a family of smooth $G$-Hilbert schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G = \mathbb{Z}/r\mathbb{Z}$ be the cyclic group of order $r$, and let $\varpi = e^{2\pi i / r}$ denote a primitive $r$ th root of unity. Consider the action of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ via the embedding $$
  \varphi : G \hookrightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C}), \qquad
  \varphi(1) = \mathrm{diag}\!\bigl(
  \underbrace{\varpi, \dots, \varpi}_{s},\,
  \underbrace{\varpi^{-1}, \dots, \varpi^{-1}}_{n - s}
  \bigr), $$ where $0 &lt; s &lt; n $. Denote the corresponding GIT quotient by $$ \mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} = \mathrm{Spec}\bigl((\mathbb{C}[z_1,\dots,z_n])^G\bigr). $$ Then the varieties $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$ is a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\tfrac{1}{r}\bigl(\underbrace{1,\dots,1}_{s}, \underbrace{-1,\dots,-1}_{n-s}\bigr)$.
  We show that the associated $G$-Hilbert schemes $\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}$ are smooth, connected, and irreducible. The natural morphism $$ \rho_{s,n,r}:\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r}\longrightarrow\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r} $$ is a projective resolution of $\mathcal{X}_{s,n,r}$, discrepant for $n \ge 3$. We establish that the irreducible components of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$ are in bijection with the nontrivial characters of \(G\), thereby realizing the classical McKay correspondence in this family of examples.
  Finally, we describe a canonical choice of this bijection via the Fourier--Mukai type functor $$ \Psi : D^b(\mathrm{Coh}_G(\mathbb{C}^n)) \longrightarrow D^b(\mathrm{Coh}(\mathcal{Y}_{s,n,r})), $$ by showing that, for each nontrivial irreducible representation of $G$, the corresponding skyscraper sheaf is mapped to a complex whose $0^{\text{th}}$ cohomology is supported on a unique irreducible component of the central fiber $\rho_{s,n,r}^{-1}(0)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the pseudo-effective cone of divisors of $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ is not polyhedral for $n\geq 8$ by constructing an extremal non-polyhedral ray of the dual cone of moving curves via maps on meromorphic strata of differentials returning the residues at the poles of the parameterised differentials. An immediate corollary is that these spaces are not Mori Dream Spaces.</description>

      <title>Clifford spaces of empty intersections of quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a linear space $U \subset \mathrm{Sym}^2V^\vee$ of quadrics in a projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$ whose intersection is empty, we consider the corresponding Clifford space -- the projective space $\mathbb{P}(U)$ endowed with the even part of Clifford algebras as a sheaf of algebras. We show that the derived category of a Clifford space is generated by a full exceptional collection that extends to a 1-periodic helix and the Clifford space is equivalent to the noncommutative projective spectrum of the corresponding graded algebra.
  We discuss two special cases of Clifford spaces in more detail.
  The first is the maximal Clifford space, associated to the complete linear system $U = \mathrm{Sym}^2V^\vee$ of quadrics. It is homologically projectively dual to the second Veronese embedding of the projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$. We show that the corresponding graded algebra is the maximal multiplicity-free direct sum of all polynomial representations of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ and describe its dual $\mathrm{A}_\infty$-algebra.
  The second is a minimal Clifford space, associated to a linear system of quadrics with $\dim(U) = \dim(V)$. We show that the corresponding graded algebra is a Koszul flat deformation of a polynomial algebra and its dual algebra is a Frobenius flat deformation of an exterior algebra. In particular, a minimal Clifford space is an example of a noncommutative projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the rational motive of the stack of local $G$-shtukas, for a split reductive group $G$, representing compactly supported cohomology in terms of the motive of the stack of $G$-zips. This result makes explicit use of the truncated version of local $G$-shtukas established by Viehmann-Wedhorn and the theoretical background on the $*$- and $!$-adjunction for pro-systems of algebraic objects established by the author.</description>

      <title>Generators vs. classical generators in derived categories of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is mostly an expository note about an example communicated to the author by Aise Johan de Jong. In a triangulated category $T$ an object $G$ is said to be a classical generator when the smallest triangulated subcategory containing $G$ coincides with the whole $T$, and it is said to be a generator when the orthogonal complement to $G$ in $T$ is zero, i.e., when any non-zero object of $T$ admits a non-zero map from a shift of $G$. Any classical generator is a generator, but not vice versa. We discuss a simple algebro-geometric example of a non-classical generator in the derived category of coherent sheaves on any smooth proper curve of genus $g \geq 2$. We also overview what is known and what is not known, in general, about generators and classical generators on curves.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the Multivariate and Matrix Variate Symmetric Laplace Distributions through Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24863v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distributions through group actions. The multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distributions are not in the exponential family of distributions. We relate the maximum likelihood estimation problems of these distributions to norm minimization over a group and build a correspondence between stability of data with respect to the group action and the properties of the likelihood function.</description>

      <title>On the k-th Milnor and k-th Tjurina Numbers of a Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of the $k$-th Milnor number and the $k$-th Tjurina number for a germ of holomorphic foliation on the complex plane with an isolated singularity at the origin. We develop a detailed study of these invariants, establishing explicit formulas and relating them to other indices associated with holomorphic foliations. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation and, as a consequence, a formula for the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function. We analyze their topological behavior, proving that the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function is a topological invariant, whereas the $k$-th Tjurina number is not. In dimension two, we provide a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Hussain, Liu, Yau, and Zuo concerning a sharp lower bound for the $k$-th Tjurina number of a weighted homogeneous polynomial. We also present a counterexample to another conjecture of Hussain, Yau, and Zuo regarding the ratio between these invariants. Moreover, we establish a fundamental relation linking the $k$-th Tjurina numbers of a foliation and of an invariant curve via the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, and we extend Teissier's Lemma to the setting of $k$-th polar intersection numbers. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation in terms of its $k$-th Tjurina number along balanced divisors of separatrices. Finally, for non-dicritical quasi-homogeneous foliations, we obtain a closed formula for their $k$-th Milnor and Tjurina numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of multipliers of a degenerating sequence of complex rational maps. We show either most periodic points have uniformly bounded multipliers, or most of them have exploding multipliers at a common scale. We further explore the set of scales induced by the growth of multipliers. Using Ahbyankar's theorem, we prove that there can be at most 2d-2 such non-trivial multiplier scales.</description>

      <title>Bounded ratios for Lorentzian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicative inequalities among entries of Lorentzian matrices, referred to as bounded ratios. These inequalities can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Alexandrov--Fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes. Our main structural result identifies the cone of all bounded ratios on Lorentzian matrices with the dual of the cut cone, a finitely generated integral polyhedral cone extensively studied in metric geometry and graph theory. We examine in detail the pentagonal ratio, which first appears for Lorentzian matrices of size at least five. For Lorentzian matrices of size three, we determine the optimal bounding constants across the entire cone of bounded ratios, obtaining an explicit entropy-like formula. We conjecture that any normalized bounded ratio is, in fact, bounded by 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comma category, exemplified in algebraic geometry by coherent systems, combines two categories over a third through morphisms between their objects. We establish sufficient conditions for it to be abelian, compute its Grothendieck group, and give necessary and sufficient criteria for it to be noetherian and artinian. Finally, we define a stability condition on abelian comma categories under hypotheses on the initial categories and, conversely, induce stability conditions on the initial abelian categories from those on the comma categories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Decompositions of Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25681v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the Generalized Additive Decomposition (GAD) of symmetric tensors, that is, degree-$d$ forms $f \in \mathcal{S}_d$. From a geometric perspective, a GAD corresponds to representing a point on a secant of osculating varieties to the Veronese variety, providing a compact and structured description of a tensor that captures its intrinsic algebraic properties. We provide a linear algebra method for measuring the GAD size and prove that the minimal achievable size, which we call the GAD-rank of the considered tensor, coincides with the rank of suitable Catalecticant matrices, under certain regularity assumptions. We provide a new explicit description of the apolar scheme associated with a GAD as the annihilator of a polynomial-exponential series. We show that if the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of this scheme is sufficiently small, then both the GAD and the associated apolar scheme are minimal and unique. Leveraging these results, we develop a numerical GAD algorithm for symmetric tensors that effectively exploits the underlying algebraic structure, extending existing algebraic approaches based on eigen computation to the treatment of multiple points. We illustrate the effectiveness and numerical stability of such an algorithm through several examples, including Waring and tangential decompositions.</description>

      <title>Hodge Structures of Complex Multiplication Type from Rational Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under certain assumptions, we show that unitary rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ conformal field theories together with a certain generating set of Cardy boundary states in the associated boundary conformal field theories give rise to rational Hodge structures of complex multiplication type. We argue that these rational Hodge structures for such rational conformal field theories arising from infrared fixed points of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ non-linear sigma models with Calabi-Yau target spaces coincide with the rational Hodge structures of the middle-dimensional cohomology of the target space geometry. This gives non-trivial evidence of the general expectation in the literature that rational $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric conformal field theories associated to Calabi-Yau target spaces yield middle dimensional cohomological rational Hodge structures with complex multiplication. We exemplify our general results with the $\mathcal{N}=2$ A-type minimal model series - which do not have a geometric origin as a non-linear sigma model - and with two explicit $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Gepner models that correspond to particular non-linear sigma models with specific Calabi-Yau threefold target spaces.</description>

      <title>A tale of two moduli spaces: logarithmic and multi-scale differentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale differentials were constructed by M.~Bainbridge, D.~Chen, Q.~Gendron, S.~Grushevsky, and M.~M\"oller, from the viewpoint of flat and complex geometry, for the purpose of compactifying moduli spaces of curves together with a differential with prescribed orders of zeros and poles. Logarithmic differentials were constructed by S.~Marcus and J.~Wise, as a generalization of stable rubber maps from Gromov--Witten theory. Modulo the global residue condition that isolates the main components of the compactification, we show that these two kinds of differentials are equivalent, and establish an isomorphism of their (coarse) moduli stacks. Moreover, we describe the rubber and multi-scale spaces as an explicit blowup of the moduli space of stable pointed rational curves in the case of genus zero, and as a global blowup of the incidence variety compactification for arbitrary genera, which implies their projectivity. We also propose a refined double ramification cycle formula in the twisted Hodge bundle which interacts with the universal line bundle class.</description>

      <title>Hadamard-Hitchcock decompositions: identifiability and computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hadamard-Hitchcock decomposition of a multidimensional array is a decomposition that expresses the latter as a Hadamard product of several tensor rank decompositions. Such decompositions can encode probability distributions that arise from statistical graphical models associated to complete bipartite graphs with one layer of observed random variables and one layer of hidden ones, usually called restricted Boltzmann machines. We establish generic identifiability of Hadamard-Hitchcock decompositions by exploiting the reshaped Kruskal criterion for tensor rank decompositions. A flexible algorithm leveraging existing decomposition algorithms for tensor rank decomposition is introduced for computing a Hadamard-Hitchcock decomposition. Numerical experiments illustrate its computational performance and numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rational motives on pro-algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an $\infty$-category of rational motives for inverse limits of algebraic stacks, so-called pro-algebraic stacks. We show that it admits a $6$-functor formalism for certain classes of morphisms. On pro-schemes, we show that this $6$-functor formalism is in the sense of Liu-Zheng. This theory yields an approach to the theory of motives for non-representable algebraic stacks and non-finite type morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16957v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study concerns the Euclidean distance function in case of complex plane curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into components which are responsible for three types of behavior of the Morse points. Besides the traditional focal component, which is non--linear; the other components are lines. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due to the loss of Morse critical points at isotropic points at infinity. This phenomenon is specific for the complex setting.
  We find formulas for the number of Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding type of attractors when moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.</description>

Abstract: We show that the projection morphism $X^{[3,4]} \lra X^{[3]}$ is flat even if it has reducible fiber. After analyzing blow-up constructions related to $X^{[3,4]}$, we conclude that $X^{[3,4]}$ has canonical Gorenstein singularities. As a corollary, we specify the singularities of several nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Topologies and sheaves on causal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A causal manifold $(M,\gamma)$ is a manifold $M$ endowed with a closed proper cone $\gamma$ in the tangent bundle $TM$ such that the projection $TM\to M$ is surjective when restricted to the interior of $\gamma$. Let $\lambda$ be the antipodal of the polar cone of $\gamma$.
  An open set $U$ of $M$ is called $\gamma$-open if its Whitney normal cone contains the interior of $\gamma$. Similarly, $U$ is called $\lambda$-open if the micro-support of the constant sheaf on $U$ is contained in $\lambda$. We begin by proving that the two notions coincide.
  Next, we prove that if $(M,\gamma)$ admits a ``future time function'' the functor of direct images establishes an equivalence of triangulated categories between the derived category of sheaves on $M$ micro-supported by $\lambda$ and the derived category of sheaves on the manifold $M$ endowed with the $\gamma$-topology. This generalizes a result of~\cite{KS90} which dealt with the case of a constant cone in a vector space.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizability of epimorphisms to curve orbifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected dense Zariski open set of a compact K\"ahler manifold $U$, we address the general problem of the existence of surjective holomorphic maps ${F:U\to C}$ to smooth complex quasi-projective curves from properties of $\pi_1(U)$. It is known that, if such $F$ exists, then there exists a finitely generated normal subgroup $K\trianglelefteq\pi_1(U)$ such that $\pi_1(U)/K$ is isomorphic to a curve orbifold group $G$ (i.e. the orbifold fundamental group of a smooth complex quasi-projective curve endowed with an orbifold structure). In this paper, we address the converse of that statement in the case where the orbifold Euler characteristic of $G$ is negative, finding a (unique) surjective holomorphic map $F:U\to C$ which realizes the quotient $\pi_1(U)\twoheadrightarrow \pi_1(U)/K\cong G$ at the level of (orbifold) fundamental groups. We also prove that our theorem is sharp, meaning that the result does not hold for any curve orbifold group with non-negative orbifold Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we apply our main theorem to address Serre's question of which orbifold fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective curves can be realized as fundamental groups of complements of curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

Abstract: We determine the pure magnets (certain monoids) for the double scalar action of $\mathbb{G}_m^2$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$, and compute the associated attractors, yielding a canonical, fully explicit stratification. This provides a concrete non-affine example illustrating the invariants of Algebraic Magnetism. We also introduce the notion of lambdafiable magnets and use it to connect magnets and cocharacters.</description>

Abstract: We study the Brauer groups of affine surfaces that are complements of singular hyperplane sections of smooth cubic surfaces over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. We determine the Brauer group over the algebraic closure as a Galois module for all the possible singular hyperplane sections. For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines, we give explicit examples where transcendental elements of order $2$ and $3$ exist over $\mathbb{Q}$. We end with an application on the integral Brauer-Manin obstruction to the integral Hasse principle.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of rational motives admits several models, including those of Morel, Beilinson, Ayoub, and Voevodsky. An open question has been the equivalence of Voevodsky's Nisnevich-based $\mathrm{DM}(S, \mathbb{Q})$ with the others, which was only known over restricted base schemes.
  This paper resolves this question. We prove that all major variants of rational motives are equivalent over an arbitrary base scheme $S$, removing all previous restrictions.
  Our main technical result is a stable motivic equivalence between the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linear spectrum $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{S}]$ and the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. This equivalence is established by reducing the problem to an unstable comparison of rationalized homotopy quotients and coarse symmetric powers, using a rational motivic Whitehead theorem we develop.
  As a byproduct, we confirm rational variant of Voevodsky's conjecture that the formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ is stable under arbitrary base change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

More precisely, given any bounded graded filtration F of the section ring of L, the set of bounded decreasing convex functions on the support of the Duistermaat--Heckman measure of F embeds L^p-isometrically into the space of bounded positive metrics on L with respect to Darvas' d_p distance for all p\in[1,\infty), and in particular with respect to the Mabuchi metric (p=2).</description>

      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</description>
