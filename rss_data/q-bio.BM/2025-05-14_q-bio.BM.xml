      <title>Linear to Neural Networks Regression: QSPR of Drugs via Degree-Distance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) analysis to explore the correlation between the physical properties of drug molecules and their topological indices using machine learning techniques. While prior studies in drug design have focused on degree-based topological indices, this work analyzes a dataset of 166 drug molecules by computing degree-distance-based topological indices, incorporating vertex-edge weightings with respect to different six atomic properties (atomic number, atomic radius, atomic mass, density, electronegativity, ionization). Both linear models (Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression) and nonlinear approaches (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) were employed to predict molecular properties. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these indices in predicting specific physicochemical properties and underscore the practical relevance of computational methods in molecular property estimation. The study provides an innovative perspective on integrating topological indices with machine learning to enhance predictive accuracy, highlighting their potential application in drug discovery and development processes. This predictive may also explain that establishing a reliable relationship between topological indices and physical properties enables chemists to gain preliminary insights into molecular behavior before conducting experimental analyses, thereby optimizing resource utilization in cheminformatics research.</description>

      <title>Protein FID: Improved Evaluation of Protein Structure Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure generative models have seen a recent surge of interest, but meaningfully evaluating them computationally is an active area of research. While current metrics have driven useful progress, they do not capture how well models sample the design space represented by the training data. We argue for a protein Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric to supplement current evaluations with a measure of distributional similarity in a semantically meaningful latent space. Our FID behaves desirably under protein structure perturbations and correctly recapitulates similarities between protein samples: it correlates with optimal transport distances and recovers FoldSeek clusters and the CATH hierarchy. Evaluating current protein structure generative models with FID shows that they fall short of modeling the distribution of PDB proteins.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis using Multi-ligand Simultaneous Docking of Withaferin A and Garcinol Reveals Enhanced BCL-2 and AKT-1 Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing an effective medicine to combat cancer and elusive stem cells is crucial in the current scenario. Withaferin A and Garcinol, important phytoconstituents of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) and Garcinia indica (Kokum) respectively, known for their therapeutic efficiency, have been used for several decades for treating various disorders, because of their anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive properties. This study investigates the potentials of withaferin A and garcinol in inhibiting BCL-2 and AKT-1, crucial proteins contributing in cancer cell persistence by evading apoptosis, increased cell proliferation, and inflammation. Molecular docking techniques, including single docking and MLSD, were used to understand the binding interaction of the ligands with BCL-2 and AKT-1. MLSD highlighted inter-ligand interactions among withaferin A and garcinol, against BCL-2, with a binding affinity of -11.88 +- 0.12 kcal/mol, surpassing the binding affinity of venetoclax (-9.73 +- 0.1 kcal/mol) a commercial inhibitor of BCL-2. For AKT-1, the binding affinity of withaferin A and garcinol (-13.74 +- 0.08 kcal/mol) surpassed the binding affinity of melatonin (-7.24 +- 0.06 kcal/mol), a commercial inhibitor of AKT-1. The MLSD results highlight the combined effects of garcinol and withaferin A, highlighting the importance of considering both the interactions of the bioactive compounds in the development of new medicines and strategies targeting cancer and elusive stem cells.</description>

      <title>Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have &gt; 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>FLOWR: Flow Matching for Structure-Aware De Novo, Interaction- and Fragment-Based Ligand Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FLOWR, a novel structure-based framework for the generation and optimization of three-dimensional ligands. FLOWR integrates continuous and categorical flow matching with equivariant optimal transport, enhanced by an efficient protein pocket conditioning. Alongside FLOWR, we present SPINDR, a thoroughly curated dataset comprising ligand-pocket co-crystal complexes specifically designed to address existing data quality issues. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FLOWR surpasses current state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of PoseBusters-validity, pose accuracy, and interaction recovery, while offering a significant inference speedup, achieving up to 70-fold faster performance. In addition, we introduce FLOWR:multi, a highly accurate multi-purpose model allowing for the targeted sampling of novel ligands that adhere to predefined interaction profiles and chemical substructures for fragment-based design without the need of re-training or any re-sampling strategies</description>
