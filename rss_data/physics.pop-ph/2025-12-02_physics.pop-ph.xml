      <title>Classical Reconstruction of the PMNS Matrix Using a Mechanical Neutrino Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations arise from quantum interference between neutrino mass eigenstates and are governed by the PMNS matrix. Although this is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, its mathematical structure is analogous to systems of coupled classical oscillators. In this work, a three--pendulum system connected by springs is constructed as a classical analog of three--flavor neutrino oscillations. Measurements of amplitude transfer, normal--mode structure, and beat frequencies are used to extract a mechanical mixing matrix, which is compared with the structure of the PMNS matrix under the assumption of zero CP violation. A scaling relation linking mechanical time evolution to the neutrino \(L/E\) behavior is derived, clarifying the scope and limitations of the analogy. The experiment demonstrates how abstract concepts of neutrino mixing can be visualized using simple and accessible classical systems, offering both pedagogical value and a qualitative understanding of flavor oscillation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Roullete curves, coin paradox and Aristotle's wheel paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses the concept of roulette, the generated curves that occur when one curve rolls without slipping along another, tracing the path of a fixed point. The coin paradox and Aristotle's wheel paradox are used as pedagogical motivations to discuss the parametric equations of epicycloids and hypocycloids, providing a geometrical intuition for the mathematical derivations and computational implementation of those curves. Python code is provided to motivate the application of the derived parametric equations, resulting in concrete visualizations and animations.</description>

      <title>Astro-Animation -- How Artists and Scientists Envision the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. "Science anxiety" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled "The Movements of the Universe", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.</description>

      <title>Physical Probability in the Everett Interpretation and Bell Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define a notion of local causality LOC closely modelled on the Bell principle, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is retrocausation, known to Bell, but the other is nonuniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for the Bell principle. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in agreement with the Born rule, and therefore violating Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violations of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.</description>
