      <title>A non-surjective Wigner-type theorem in terms of equivalent pairs of subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space and let ${\mathcal G}_{\infty}(H)$ be the set of all closed subspaces of $H$ whose dimension and codimension both are infinite. We investigate (not necessarily surjective) transformations of ${\mathcal G}_{\infty}(H)$ sending every pair of subspaces to an equivalent pair of subspaces; two pairs of subspaces are equivalent if there is a linear isometry sending one of these pairs to the other. Let $f$ be such a transformation. We show that there is a unique up to a scalar multiple linear or conjugate linear isometry $L:H\to H$ such that for every $X\in {\mathcal G}_{\infty}(H)$ the image $f(X)$ is the sum of $L(X)$ and a certain closed subspace $O(X)$ orthogonal to the range of $L$. In the case when $H$ is separable, we give the following sufficient condition to assert that $f$ is induced by a linear or conjugate linear isometry: if $O(X)=0$ for a certain $X\in {\mathcal G}_{\infty}(H)$, then the same holds for all $X\in {\mathcal G}_{\infty}(H)$.</description>

      <title>On the Ginzburg-Landau Energy of Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well known fact that the geometry of a superconducting sample influences the distribution of the surface superconductivity for strong applied magnetic fields. For instance, the presence of corners induces geometric terms described through effective models in sector-like regions. We study the connection between two effective models for the offset of superconductivity and for surface superconductivity introduced in \cite{BNF} and \cite{CG2}, respectively. We prove that the transition between the two models is continuous with respect to the magnetic field strength, and, as a byproduct, we deduce the existence of a minimizer at the threshold for both effective problems. Furthermore, as a consequence, we disprove a conjecture stated in \cite{CG2} concerning the dependence of the corner energy on the angle close to the threshold.</description>

      <title>Shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are widely implemented numerical integrators for Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve the Hamiltonian structure (symplecticity) of the system. Although the symplectic integrator does not conserve the energy of the system, it is well known that there exists a conserving modified Hamiltonian, called the shadow Hamiltonian. For the Nambu mechanics, which is one of the generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, we can also construct structure-preserving integrators by the same procedure used to construct the symplectic integrators. In the structure-preserving integrator, however, the existence of shadow Hamiltonians is non-trivial. This is because the Nambu mechanics is driven by multiple Hamiltonians and it is non-trivial whether the time evolution by the integrator can be cast into the Nambu mechanical time evolution driven by multiple shadow Hamiltonians. In the present paper we construct structure-preserving integrators for a simple Nambu mechanical system, and derive the shadow Hamiltonians in two ways. This is the first attempt to derive shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics. We show that the fundamental identity, which corresponds to the Jacobi identity in Hamiltonian mechanics, plays an important role to calculate the shadow Hamiltonians using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. It turns out that the resulting shadow Hamiltonians have indefinite forms depending on how the fundamental identities are used. This is not a technical artifact, because the exact shadow Hamiltonians obtained independently have the same indefiniteness.</description>

      <title>Beyond directed hypergraphs: heterogeneous hypergraphs and spectral centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of hypergraphs has received a lot of attention over the past few years, however up until recently there has been no interest in systems where higher order interactions are not undirected. In this article we introduce the notion of heterogeneous hypergraphs from an algebraic point of view, which have traditional directed hypergraphs as a particular case. We furthermore analytically study the spectral centralities associated to some types of heterogeneous hypergraphs, extending previously defined eigenvector-like centrality measures to this new realm. We supplement the analytical arguments with some numerical comparisons of pairwise and higher order rankings, and we construct directed higher order networks from real data.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $\textnormal{II}_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP 2023, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <title>Emergent $D_8^{(1)}$ spectrum and topological soliton excitation in CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum integrability emerging near a quantum critical point (QCP) is manifested by exotic excitation spectrum that is organized by the associated algebraic structure. A well known example is the emergent $E_8$ integrability near the QCP of a transverse field Ising chain (TFIC), which was long predicted theoretically and initially proposed to be realized in the quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) quantum magnet CoNb$_2$O$_6$. However, later measurements on the spin excitation spectrum of this material revealed a series of satellite peaks that cannot be described by the $E_8$ Lie algebra. Motivated by these experimental progresses, we hereby revisit the spin excitations of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ by combining numerical calculation and analytical analysis. We show that, as effects of strong interchain fluctuations, the spectrum of the system near the 1D QCP is characterized by the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ Lie algebra with robust topological soliton excitation. We further show that the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ spectrum can be realized in a broad class of interacting quantum systems. Our results advance the exploration of integrability and manipulation of topological excitations in quantum critical systems.</description>

      <title>Semigroup of annuli in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the semigroup of annuli with boundary parametrization plays a special role, in that it generates the whole algebra of local conformal symmetries, the so-called Virasoro algebra. The subgroup of elements $\mathbb{A}_f=\mathbb{D}\setminus f(\mathbb{D}^\circ)$ for contracting biholomorphisms $f:\mathbb{D}\to f(\mathbb{D})\subset \mathbb{D}^\circ$ with $f(0)=0$ is called the holomorphic semigroup of annuli. In this article, we construct a differentiable representation of the holomorphic semigroup into the space of bounded operators on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Liouville Conformal Field Theory and show it generates under differentiation the positive Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\geq 0$. We also construct a projective representation of the semigroup of annuli in the space of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of Segal amplitudes and show that all Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ are generated by differentiation of these annuli amplitudes. Finally, we use this to show that the Segal amplitudes for Liouville theory are differentiable with respetc to their boundary parametrizations, and the differential is computed in terms of Virasoro generators. This paper will serve, in a forthcoming work, as a fundamental tool in the construction of the conformal blocks as globally defined holomorphic sections of a holomorphic line bundle on Teichmuller space and satisfying the Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-to-local convergence rates for strong solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish the nonlocal-to-local convergence of strong solutions to a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model with singular potential describing immiscible, viscous two-phase flows with matched densities, which is referred to as the Model H. This means that we show that the strong solutions to the nonlocal Model H converge to the strong solution to the local Model H as the weight function in the nonlocal interaction kernel approaches the delta distribution. Compared to previous results in the literature, our main novelty is to further establish corresponding convergence rates. Before investigating the nonlocal-to-local convergence, we first need to ensure the strong well-posedness of the nonlocal Model H. In two dimensions, this result can already be found in the literature, whereas in three dimensions, it will be shown in the present paper. Moreover, in both two and three dimensions, we establish suitable uniform bounds on the strong solutions of the nonlocal Model H, which are essential to prove the nonlocal-to-local convergence results.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: A self-consistent quadratic theory is presented to account for nonlinear contributions in quantum dynamics. Evolution equations are shown to depend on higher-order gradients of the Hamiltonian, which are incorporated via their equations of motion or through perturbative calculations. The dynamics is proven trace-preserving, with the Hamiltonian acting as a constant of motion for initial Gaussian states. Nonlinear response functions are calculated perturbatively, and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of their classical limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured B.~Helffer and S.~Fournais, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations and pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Painlev\'e equations constitute a famous class of integrable non-autonomous second order difference equations. A classification scheme proposed by Sakai interprets a discrete Painlev\'e equation as a birational map between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). Sakai's classification is thus based on the classification of generalized Halphen surfaces. We propose a novel geometric interpretation of discrete Painlev\'e equations, where the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as a birational transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one, according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$.
  While historically discrete Painlev\'e equations appeared as de-autonomizations of QRT maps, in our scheme they are viewed as deformations of 3D QRT maps introduced in our previous paper. A 3D QRT map is defined geometrically as a composition of involutions along generators of quadrics of a pencil, preserving the intersection curves with a second pencil of quadrics. The base set of the net of quadrics spanned by both pencils consists of eight points (which play the role of the eight blow-up points of generalized Halphen surfaces). A Painlev\'e deformation of a 3D QRT map is obtained by composing involutions along generators with a birational (often linear) transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ under which the pencil remains invariant, but the individual quadrics are mapped according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode the signal architecture have had an exceptional impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, the present study introduces a representation system for acoustic waves in 2D space-time, referred to as the boostlet transform, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields with the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Continuous boostlets, $\psi_{a,\theta,\tau}(\varsigma) = a^{-1} \psi \left(D_a^{-1} B_\theta^{-1}(\varsigma-\tau)\right) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations $a &gt; 0$, Lorentz boosts $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, and translations $\smash{\tau \in \mathbb{R}^2}$ in space--time. The admissibility condition requires that boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., have phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. The continuous boostlet transform is an isometry for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, and a sparsity analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that boostlet coefficients decay faster than wavelets, curvelets, wave atoms, and shearlets. The uncertainty principles and minimizers associated with the boostlet transform are derived and interpreted physically.</description>

      <title>Branching algebras for the general linear Lie superalgebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic approach to the branching of representations of the general linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}_{p|q}({\mathbb C})$, by constructing certain super commutative algebras whose structure encodes the branching rules. Using this approach, we derive the branching rules for restricting any irreducible polynomial representation $V$ of $\mathfrak{gl}_{p|q}({\mathbb C})$ to a regular subalgebra isomorphic to $\mathfrak{gl}_{r|s}({\mathbb C})\oplus \mathfrak{gl}_{r'|s'}({\mathbb C})$, $\mathfrak{gl}_{r|s}({\mathbb C})\oplus\mathfrak{gl}_1({\mathbb C})^{r'+s'}$ or $\mathfrak{gl}_{r|s}({\mathbb C})$, with $r+r'=p$ and $s+s'=q$. In the case of $\mathfrak{gl}_{r|s}({\mathbb C})\oplus\mathfrak{gl}_1({\mathbb C})^{r'+s'}$ with $s=0$ or $s=1$ but general $r$, we also construct a basis for the space of $\mathfrak{gl}_{r|s}({\mathbb C})$ highest weight vectors in $V$; when $r=s=0$, the branching rule leads to explicit expressions for the weight multiplicities of $V$ in terms of Kostka numbers.</description>

      <title>Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough on smooth imploding solutions of compressible Euler, we construct self-similar smooth imploding solutions of isentropic relativistic Euler equations with isothermal equation of state $p=\frac1\ell\varrho$ for \textit{all} $\ell&gt;1$ in physical space dimension $d=2,3$ and for $\ell&gt;1$ close to 1 in higher dimensions.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique Nature of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is the root cause of the many remarkable properties of the Einstein spacetimes, in particular their operational structure on the 2-forms. We show how this operational structure can be used for two ends. First, it allows for a simple generalization of the Birkhoff theorem to Schwarzschild (A)de-Sitter spacetime. Second, it provides the means to construct an Abelian endomorphism group on the space of 2-forms. It is observed that taking the trace over this group element-wise induces a further Abelian group which may be identified with a tensor representation of conformal transformations, giving Einstein spacetimes access to their own conformal equivalence class. A further trace over the group yields the curvature invariants of the spacetime. The Kretschmann scalar becomes the topological Euler density, which may be linked in a simple way to the Hawking temperature of horizons.</description>

Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolevextension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential oper-ators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitzdomains, but also domains with fractal boundaries. Our formulation does not involveany measures on the boundary. We discuss basic properties of these operators and usethem to generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Stabilization of Nitsche's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak imposition of essential boundary conditions is an integral aspect of unfitted finite element methods, where the physical boundary does not in general coincide with the computational domain. In this regard, the symmetric Nitsche's method is a powerful technique that preserves the symmetry and variational consistency of the unmodified weak formulation. The stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays a crucial role in the stability of the resultant formulation, whose estimation is computationally intensive and dependent on the particular cut configuration using the conventional eigenvalue-based approach. In this work, we employ as model problem the finite cell method in which the need for the generation of a boundary-conforming mesh is circumvented by embedding the physical domain in a, typically regular, background mesh. We propose a data-driven estimate based on machine learning methods for the estimation of the stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method that offers an efficient constant-complexity alternative to the eigenvalue-based approach independent of the cut configuration. It is shown, using numerical benchmarks, that the proposed method can estimate the stabilization parameter accurately and is by far more computationally efficient. The data-driven estimate can be integrated into existing numerical codes with minimal modifications and thanks to the wide adoption of accelerators such as GPUs by machine learning frameworks, can be used with virtually no extra implementation cost on GPU devices, further increasing the potential for computational gains over the conventional eigenvalue-based estimate.</description>

      <title>A restricted additive smoother for finite cell flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adaptive geometric multigrid method for the solution of large-scale finite cell flow problems. The finite cell method seeks to circumvent the need for a boundary-conforming mesh through the embedding of the physical domain in a regular background mesh. As a result of the intersection between the physical domain and the background computational mesh, the resultant systems of equations are typically numerically ill-conditioned, rendering the appropriate treatment of cutcells a crucial aspect of the solver. To this end, we propose a smoother operator with favorable parallel properties and discuss its memory footprint and parallelization aspects. We propose three cache policies that offer a balance between cached and on-the-fly computation and discuss the optimization opportunities offered by the smoother operator. It is shown that the smoother operator, on account of its additive nature, can be replicated in parallel exactly with little communication overhead, which offers a major advantage in parallel settings as the geometric multigrid solver is consequently independent of the number of processes. The convergence and scalability of the geometric multigrid method is studied using numerical examples. It is shown that the iteration count of the solver remains bounded independent of the problem size and depth of the grid hierarchy. The solver is shown to obtain excellent weak and strong scaling using numerical benchmarks with more than 665 million degrees of freedom. The presented geometric multigrid solver is, therefore, an attractive option for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems in massively parallel high-performance computing environments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the intertwining of Laguerre processes of parameter $\alpha$ in different dimensions.
  We introduce a Feller kernel that depends on $\alpha $ and intertwines the $\alpha$-Laguerre process in $N+1$ dimensions and that in $N$ dimensions.
  When $\alpha $ is a non-negative integer, the new kernel is interpreted in terms of the conditional distribution of the squared singular values: if the singular values of a unitarily invariant random matrix of order $(N+\alpha +1) \times (N+1)$ are fixed, then the those of its $(N+\alpha) \times N $ truncation matrix are given by the new kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an $N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare a relativistic and a nonrelativistic version of Ostrogradsky's method for higher-time derivative theories extended to scalar field theories and consider as an alternative a multi-field variant. We apply the schemes to space-time rotated modified Korteweg-de Vries systems and, exploiting their integrability, to Hamiltonian systems built from space-time rotated inverse Legendre transformed higher-order charges of these systems. We derive the equal-time Poisson bracket structures of these theories, establish the integrability of the latter theories by means of the Painlev\'e test and construct exact analytical period benign solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions to the classical equations of motion. The classical energies of these partially complex solutions are real when they respect a certain modified CPT-symmetry and complex when this symmetry is broken. The higher order Cauchy and initial-boundary value problem are addressed analytically and numerically. Finally, we provide the explicit quantization of the simplest mKdV system, exhibiting the usual conundrum of having the choice between either having to deal with a theory that includes non-normalizable states or spectra that are unbounded from below. In our non-Hermitian system the choice is dictated by the correct sign in the decay width.</description>

Abstract: We study the semiclassical distribution of resonances of a $2 \times 2$ matrix Schr\"odinger operator, obtained as a reduction of an Hamiltonian when studying molecular predissociation models under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The energy considered is above the energy-level crossing of the two associated classical trajectories, and is respectively trapping and non-trapping for those trajectories. Under a condition between the contact order $m$ of the crossings and the vanishing order $k$ of the interaction term at the crossing points, we show that, asymptotically in the semiclassical limit $h \to 0^+$, the imaginary part of the resonances is of size $h^{1+2(k+1)/(m+1)}$ in the general case and shrinks to $h^{1+2(k+2)/(m+1)}$ when both $k$ and $m$ are odd. We also compute the first term of the associated asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Stress tensor bounds on quantum fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singular behaviour of quantum fields in Minkowski space can often be bounded by polynomials of the Hamiltonian $H$. These so-called $H$-bounds and related techniques allow us to handle pointwise quantum fields and their operator product expansions in a mathematically rigorous way. A drawback of this approach, however, is that the Hamiltonian is a global rather than a local operator and, moreover, it is not defined in generic curved spacetimes. In order to overcome this drawback we investigate the possibility of replacing $H$ by a component of the stress tensor, essentially an energy density, to obtain analogous bounds. For definiteness we consider a massive, minimally coupled free Hermitean scalar field. Using novel results on distributions of positive type we show that in any globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold $M$ for any $f,F\in C_0^{\infty}(M)$ with $F\equiv 1$ on $\mathrm{supp}(f)$ and any timelike smooth vector field $t^{\mu}$ we can find constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that $\omega(\phi(f)^*\phi(f))\le C(\omega(T^{\mathrm{ren}}_{\mu\nu}(t^{\mu}t^{\nu}F^2))+c)$ for all (not necessarily quasi-free) Hadamard states $\omega$. This is essentially a new type of quantum energy inequality that entails a stress tensor bound on the smeared quantum field. In $1+1$ dimensions we also establish a bound on the pointwise quantum field, namely $|\omega(\phi(x))|\le C(\omega(T^{\mathrm{ren}}_{\mu\nu}(t^{\mu}t^{\nu}F^2))+c)$, where $F\equiv 1$ near $x$.</description>

      <title>The Dunkl-Fokker-Planck Equation in $1+1$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By replacing the spatial derivative with the Dunkl derivative, we generalize the Fokker-Planck equation in (1+1) dimensions. We obtain the Dunkl-Fokker-Planck eigenvalues equation and solve it for the harmonic oscillator plus a centrifugal-type potential. Furthermore, when the drift function is odd, we reduce our results to those of the recently developed Wigner-Dunkl supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: We describe embeddings of $n$-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds, including Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spaces, in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ such that the metrics of the submanifolds are inherited by a restriction from that of $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$, and the action of the linear group SO$(2, n)$ of the ambient space reduces to conformal transformations on the submanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the finite-temperature sine kernel determinant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $D(x,s)$ of the finite-temperature deformation of the sine kernel, which represents the probability that there is no particles on the interval $(-x/\pi,x/\pi)$ in the bulk scaling limit of the finite-temperature fermion system. The variable $s$ in $D(x,s)$ is related to the temperature. The determinant also corresponds to the finite-temperature correlation function of one dimensional Bose gas. We derive the asymptotics of $D(x,s)$ in several different regimes in the $(x,s)$-plane. A third-order phase transition is observed in the asymptotic expansions as both $x$ and $s$ tend to positive infinity at certain related speed. The phase transition is then shown to be described by an integral involving the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic preserving kinetic scheme for the M1 model of linear transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moment models with suitable closure can lead to accurate and computationally efficient solvers for particle transport. Hence, we propose a new asymptotic preserving scheme for the M1 model of linear transport that works uniformly for any Knudsen number. Our idea is to apply the M1 closure at the numerical level to an existing asymptotic preserving scheme for the corresponding kinetic equation, namely the Unified Gas Kinetic scheme (UGKS) originally proposed in [27] and extended to linear transport in [24]. In order to ensure the moments realizability in this new scheme, the UGKS positivity needs to be maintained. We propose a new density reconstruction in time to obtain this property. A second order extension is also suggested and validated. Several test cases show the performances of this new scheme.</description>

Abstract: We consider quiver forms that appear in the motivic Donaldson-Thomas generating series or characters of conformal field theories and relate them to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories on $D^2 \times_q S^1$ with certain boundary conditions preserving 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry. We apply this to the 3d-3d correspondence and provide a Lagrangian description of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories $T[M_3]$ with 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ boundary conditions for 3-manifolds $M_3$ in several contexts.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of shallow neural networks and constructive ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we approach the problem of cost (loss) minimization in underparametrized shallow neural networks through the explicit construction of upper bounds, without any use of gradient descent. A key focus is on elucidating the geometric structure of approximate and precise minimizers. We consider shallow neural networks with one hidden layer, a ReLU activation function, an ${\mathcal L}^2$ Schatten class (or Hilbert-Schmidt) cost function, input space ${\mathbb R}^M$, output space ${\mathbb R}^Q$ with $Q\leq M$, and training input sample size $N&gt;QM$ that can be arbitrarily large. We prove an upper bound on the minimum of the cost function of order $O(\delta_P)$ where $\delta_P$ measures the signal to noise ratio of training inputs. In the special case $M=Q$, we explicitly determine an exact degenerate local minimum of the cost function, and show that the sharp value differs from the upper bound obtained for $Q\leq M$ by a relative error $O(\delta_P^2)$. The proof of the upper bound yields a constructively trained network; we show that it metrizes a particular $Q$-dimensional subspace in the input space ${\mathbb R}^M$. We comment on the characterization of the global minimum of the cost function in the given context.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the gradient descent flow widely used for the minimization of the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost function in Deep Learning networks, and introduce two modified versions; one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. Both have a clear and natural invariant geometric meaning, taking into account the pullback vector bundle structure in the overparametrized, and the pushforward vector bundle structure in the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of factorized $A_2$-Leonard pair is introduced. It is defined as a rank 2 Leonard pair, with actions in certain bases corresponding to the root system of the Weyl group $A_2$, and with some additional properties. The functions arising as entries of transition matrices are bivariate orthogonal polynomials (of Tratnik type) with bispectral properties. Examples of factorized $A_2$-Leonard pairs are constructed using classical Leonard pairs associated to families of orthogonal polynomials of the ($q$-)Askey scheme. The most general examples are associated to an intricate product of univariate ($q$-)Hahn and dual ($q$-)Hahn polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum Gelfand invariants which first appeared in a landmark paper by Reshetikhin, Takhtadzhyan and Faddeev (1989). We calculate the eigenvalues of the invariants acting in irreducible highest weight representations of the quantized enveloping algebra for ${\mathfrak {gl}}_n$. The calculation is based on Liouville-type formulas relating two families of central elements in the quantum affine algebras of type $A$.</description>

Abstract: We continue the survey initiated in arXiv:2012.14197 to explore the Bethe/Gauge correspondence between supersymmetric SO/Sp gauge theories in 2d/3d/4d and open spin chain with integrable boundaries. We collect the known Bethe ansatz equations of different types of spin chains with general boundaries that have been analyzed in the literature, and compare them with the vacua equations of the quiver gauge theories. It seems that not all the vacua equations of quiver gauge theory with BCD-type gauge groups can be realized as some known Bethe ansatz equations of integrable spin chain models.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schr\"odinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem concerns with transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control subject to a gravitational force field. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is in fact a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. We explain how the resulting analysis leads to solving a boundary-coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the nonlinear gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate. We propose novel algorithms for the same, and present illustrative numerical results. Our analysis and the algorithmic framework are nonparametric, i.e., we make neither statistical (e.g., Gaussian, first few moments, mixture or exponential family, finite dimensionality of the sufficient statistic) nor dynamical (e.g., Taylor series) approximations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the canonical integrals associated to wheel graphs, and prove that they are proportional to odd zeta values. From this we deduce that wheel classes define explicit non-zero classes in: the locally finite homology of the general linear group $\GL_n(\ZZ)$ in both odd and even ranks, the homology of the moduli spaces of tropical curves, and the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties. We deduce the existence of a doubly infinite family of auxiliary classes in the even commutative graph complex.</description>

      <title>Many-Stage Optimal Stabilized Runge-Kutta Methods for Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel optimization procedure for the generation of stability polynomials of stabilized explicit Runge-Kutta methods is devised. Intended for semidiscretizations of hyperbolic partial differential equations, the herein developed approach allows the optimization of stability polynomials with more than hundred stages. A potential application of these high degree stability polynomials are problems with locally varying characteristic speeds as found in non-uniformly refined meshes and different wave speeds.
  To demonstrate the applicability of the stability polynomials we construct 2N storage many-stage Runge-Kutta methods that match their designed second order of accuracy when applied to a range of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with smooth solutions. The methods are constructed to reduce the amplification of round off errors which becomes a significant concern for these many-stage methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we provide some categorical perspectives on the relativization construction arising from quantum measurement theory in the presence of symmetries and occupying a central place in the operational approach to quantum reference frames. This construction provides, for any quantum system, a quantum channel from the system's algebra to the invariant algebra on the composite system also encompassing the chosen reference, contingent upon a choice of the pointer observable. These maps are understood as relativizing observables on systems upon the specification of a quantum reference frame. We begin by extending the construction to systems modelled on subspaces of algebras of operators to then define a functor taking a pair consisting of a reference frame and a system and assigning to them a subspace of relative operators defined in terms of an image of the corresponding relativization map. When a single frame and equivariant channels are considered, the relativization maps can be understood as a natural transformation. Upon fixing a system, the functor provides a novel kind of frame transformation that we call external. Results achieved provide a deeper structural understanding of the framework of interest and point towards its categorification and potential application to local systems of algebraic quantum field theories.</description>
