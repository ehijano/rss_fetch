      <title>Synchronization in a small-world network of non-identical Chialvo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synchronization dynamics of a neuron network constructed using the small-world algorithm. The stochastic version of the map-based Chialvo neuron model is used to simulate each node of the network. To represent non-identical neurons, we introduce a mismatch in one of the main model parameters. Our study explores the impact of this mismatch, noise intensity in the stochastic model, and coupling strength between neurons on synchronization and firing frequency. In our initial approach, we consider electrically coupled neurons with both excitatory and inhibitory connections. We have identified critical values of noise intensity, parameter mismatch, and rewiring probability that lead to effective synchronization within the network. Additionally, we observe that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections significantly influences global synchronization. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying synchronization dynamics in complex neuron networks.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcations in a Damped-Driven Diatomic Granular Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit here the dynamics of an engineered dimer granular crystal under an external periodic drive in the presence of dissipation. Earlier findings included a saddle-node bifurcation, whose terminal point initiated the observation of chaos; the system was found to exhibit bistability and potential quasiperiodicity. We now complement these findings by the identification of unstable manifolds of saddle periodic solutions (saddle points of the stroboscopic map) within the system dynamics. We unravel how homoclinic tangles of these manifolds lead to the appearance of a chaotic attractor, upon the apparent period-doubling bifurcations that destroy invariant tori associated with quasiperiodicity. These findings complement the earlier ones, offering more concrete insights into the emergence of chaos within this high-dimensional, experimentally accessible system.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for predicting chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting chaotic dynamical systems is critical in many scientific fields such as weather prediction, but challenging due to the characterizing sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Traditional modeling approaches require extensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards data-driven methods using machine learning. However, existing research provides inconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for predicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and heavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing databases, as well as a newly introduced one that allows for uncertainty quantification in the benchmark results. We perform hyperparameter tuning based on computational cost and introduce a novel error metric, the cumulative maximum error, which combines several desirable properties of traditional metrics, tailored for chaotic systems. Our results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as untuned baseline methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, but their performance can vary significantly with different experimental setups. These findings underscore the importance of matching prediction methods to data characteristics and available computational resources.</description>

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>
