      <title>Minimizing the Value-at-Risk of Loan Portfolio via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio. We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels, compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model, DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Analysis of Off-Exchange Public Information for Cryptocurrency Market Trend Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present unique prediction challenges due to their extreme volatility, 24/7 operation, and hypersensitivity to news events, with existing approaches suffering from key information extraction and poor sideways market detection critical for risk management. We introduce a theoretically-grounded multi-agent cryptocurrency trend prediction framework that advances the state-of-the-art through three key innovations: (1) an information-preserving news analysis system with formal theoretical guarantees that systematically quantifies market impact, regulatory implications, volume dynamics, risk assessment, technical correlation, and temporal effects using large language models; (2) an adaptive volatility-conditional fusion mechanism with proven optimal properties that dynamically combines news sentiment and technical indicators based on market regime detection; (3) a distributed multi-agent coordination architecture with low communication complexity enabling real-time processing of heterogeneous data streams. Comprehensive experimental evaluation on Bitcoin across three prediction horizons demonstrates statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art natural language processing baseline, establishing a new paradigm for financial machine learning with broad implications for quantitative trading and risk management systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the cryptocur- rencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53]. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts, al- lowing the system to adjust indicator priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantita- tive agent delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Neural Process for Implied Volatility Surfaces with SABR-induced Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat implied volatility surface (IVS) reconstruction as a two-principle learning problem. First, we adopt a meta-learning view that trains across trading days to learn a procedure that maps sparse option quotes to a full IVS via conditional prediction, avoiding per-day calibration at test time. Second, we impose a structural prior via transfer learning: pre-train on SABR-generated dataset to encode geometric prior, then fine-tune on historical market dataset to align with empirical patterns. We implement both principles in a single attention-based Neural Process (Volatility Neural Process, VolNP) that produces a complete IVS from a sparse context set in one forward pass. On SPX options, the VolNP outperforms SABR, SSVI, and Gaussian Process. Relative to an ablation trained only on market data, the SABR-induced prior reduces RMSE by about 40% and suppresses large errors, with pronounced gains at long maturities where quotes are sparse. The resulting model is fast (single pass), stable (no daily parameter solving), and practical for deployment at scale.</description>
