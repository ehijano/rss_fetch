      <title>On the slice-torus invariant $q_M$ from $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant Seiberg--Witten Floer cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Iida--Taniguchi's $\mathbb{Z}$-valued slice-torus invariant $q_M$ cannot be realized as a linear combination of Rasmussen's $s$-invariant, Ozsv\'ath--Szab\'o's $\tau$-invariant, all of the $\mathfrak{sl}_N$-concordance invariants ($N \geq 2$), Baldwin--Sivek's instanton $\tau$-invariant, Daemi--Imori--Sato--Scaduto--Taniguchi's instanton $\tilde{s}$-invariant and Sano--Sato's Rasmussen type invariants $\tilde{ss}_c$.</description>

      <title>Closed hyperbolic manifolds without $\text{spin}^c$ structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all dimensions $n \ge 5$, we prove the existence of closed orientable hyperbolic manifolds that do not admit any $\text{spin}^c$ structure, and in fact we show that there are infinitely many commensurability classes of such manifolds. These manifolds all have non-vanishing third Stiefel--Whitney class $w_3$ and are all arithmetic of simplest type. More generally, we show that for each $k \ge 1$ and $n \ge 4k+1$, there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of closed orientable hyperbolic $n$-manifolds $M$ with $w_{4k-1}(M) \ne 0$.</description>

      <title>On the connected sums of the $(2,1)$-cable of the figure eight knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the 3-fold (resp. 6-fold) connected sum of the $(2,1)$-cable of the figure-eight knot cannot bound a smooth null-homologous disk in a punctured $S^2 \times S^2$ (resp. in a punctured $#_2 S^2 \times S^2$. This result is obtained using a real version of the $10/8$-inequality established by Konno, Miyazawa, and Taniguchi.</description>

      <title>On zero-divisors and units in group rings of torsion-free CAT$(0)$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two of Kaplansky's conjectures concerning group rings $K[G]$, where $K$ is a field and $G$ is a torsion-free group: the Zero-Divisor Conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial zero-divisors, and the Unit Conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial units. While the Zero-Divisor conjecture still remains open, the Unit Conjecture was disproven by Gardam in 2021. The search for more counterexamples remains an open problem.
  Let $m$ and $n$ be the length of support of two non-trivial elements $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}_2[G]$, respectively. We address these conjectures by introducing a process called \text{left-alignment} and recursively constructing the combinatorial structures associated to $(m,n)$ which would yield counterexamples to both conjectures over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ if they satisfy conditions $\mathsf{T}_1-\mathsf{T}_4$. Such combinatorial objects are called oriented product structures of type $(m,n)$. We also present a computer-search that can be utilized to search for counterexamples of a certain geometry by significantly pruning the search space. We prove that a class CAT(0) groups with certain geometry cannot be counterexamples to these conjectures. Moreover, we prove that for $ 1\le m \le 5$ and $n$ any positive integer, there are no counterexamples to the conjectures such that the associated oriented product structures are of type $(m,n)$. With the aid of computer, we prove that, in fact, there are no such counterexamples of the length combination $(m,n)$ where $1\le m,n \le 13.$</description>

      <title>Circle graphs and the automorphism group of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that $Aut({\mathbb S}^1)$ coincides with the automorphism group of the \emph{circle graph} $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. the intersection graph of the family of chords of ${\mathbb S}^1$.
  We prove that the countable subgraph of $\mathcal{C}$ induced by the rational chords is a strongly universal element of the family of circle graphs, and that it is invariant under local complementation. The only other known connected graphs that have the latter property are $K_2$ and the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Two-bridge links and stable maps into the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a visual construction of stable maps from the $3$-sphere into the real plane enjoying the following properties; the set of definite fold points coincides with a given two-bridge link and the map only admits certain types of fibers containing two indefinite fold points. As a corollary, we determine the stable map complexities defined by Koda and Ishikawa for some two-bridge link exteriors.</description>

      <title>On diffeomorphisms of 4-dimensional 1-handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of Laudenbach and Po\'enaru's theorem, which states that any diffeomorphism of the boundary of a 4-dimensional 1-handlebody extends to the whole handlebody. Our proof is based on the cassification of Heegaard splittings of double handlebodies and a result of Cerf on diffeomorphisms of the 3-ball. Further, we extend this theorem to 4-dimensional compression bodies, namely cobordisms between 3-manifolds constructed using only 1-handles: when the negative boundary is a product of a compact surface by interval, we show that every diffeomorphism of the positive boundary extends to the whole compression body. This invlolves a strong Haken theorem for sutured Heegaard splittings and a classification of sutured Heegaard splittings of double compression bodies. Finally, we show how this applies to the study of relative trisection diagrams for compact 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>A three-variable transcendental invariant of planar knotoids via Gauss diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of the classical knots, knotoids are equivalence classes of immersions of the oriented unit interval in a surface. In recent years, a variety of invariants of spherical and planar knotoids have been constructed as extensions of invariants of classical and virtual knots. In this paper we introduce a three-variable transcendental invariant of planar knotoids which is defined over an index function of a Gauss diagram. We describe properties of this invariant and show that it is a Vassiliev invariant of order one. We also discuss the Gordian distance between planar knotoids and provide lower bounds on the Gordian distance of homotopic planar knotoids by using the transcendental invariant.</description>

      <title>The Lodha--Moore groups and their $n$-adic generalizations are not SCY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed 4-manifold is symplectic Calabi--Yau (SCY) if its canonical class is trivial. Friedl and Vidussi proved that Thompson's group $F$ cannot be the fundamental group of any SCY manifold. In this paper, we show that its generalizations, called the Brown--Thompson group and the $n$-adic Lodha--Moore groups, cannot be also the fundamental group of any SCY manifold by using their method. From this proof, we also show that there exist non-trivial infinitely many examples which satisfy Geoghegan's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Topology automaton and H\"older equivalence of Bara\'nski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of Lipschitz equivalence of fractals is a very active topic in recent years. In 2023, Huang \emph{et al.} (\textit{Topology automaton of self-similar sets and its applications to metrical classifications}, Nonlinearity \textbf{36} (2023), 2541-2566.) studied the H\"older and Lipschitz equivalence of a class of p.c.f. self-similar sets which are not totally disconnected. The main tool they used is the so called topology automaton. In this paper, we define topology automaton for Bara\'nski carpets, and we show that the method used in Huang \emph{et al.} still works for the self-affine and non-p.c.f. settings. As an application, we obtain a very general sufficient condition for Bara\'nski carpets to be H\"older (or Lipschitz) equivalent.</description>
