      <title>Exact solutions of some singular integro-differential equations related to adhesive contact problems of elasticity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of constructing an exact solution of singular integro-differential equations related to problems of adhesive interaction between elastic thin semi-infinite homogeneous patch and elastic plate is investigated. For the patch loaded with horizontal forces the usual model of the uniaxial stress state is valid. Using the methods of the theory of analytic functions and integral transformation the singular integro-differential equation is reduced to the Riemann boundary value problem of the theory of analytic functions. The exact solution of this problem and asymptotic estimates of tangential contact stresses are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the M.Kac problem with augmented data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\Omega}$ be a bounded plane domain. As is known, the spectrum $0&lt;\lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2\leqslant\dots$ of its Dirichlet Laplacian $L=-\Delta{\upharpoonright}[H^2({\Omega})\cap H^1_0({\Omega})]$ does not determine ${\Omega}$ (up to isometry). By this, a reasonable version of the M.Kac problem is to augment the spectrum with relevant data that provide the determination.
  To give the spectrum is to represent $L$ in the form $\tilde L=\Phi L\Phi^*={\rm diag\,}\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots\}$ in the space ${\bf l}_2$, where $\Phi:L_2({\Omega})\to{\bf l}_2$ is the Fourier transform. Let ${\mathscr K}=\{h\in L_2({\Omega})\,|\,\,\Delta h=0\,\,{\rm in}\,\,{\Omega}\}$ be the harmonic function subspace, $\tilde{\mathscr K}=\Phi{\mathscr K}\subset{\bf l}_2$. We show that, in a generic case, the pair $\tilde L,\tilde {\mathscr K}$ determines ${\Omega}$ up to isometry, what holds not only for the plain domains (drums) but for the compact Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary dimension, metric, and topology. Thus, the subspace $\tilde{\mathscr K}\subset{\bf l}_2$ augments the spectrum, making the problem uniquely solvable.</description>

      <title>The three-point Gaudin model and branched coverings of the Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-point $\mathfrak{sl_2}$-Gaudin model. In this case the compactification of the parameter space is $\overline{M_{0,4}(\mathbb{C})}$, which is the Riemann sphere. We analyze these sphere coverings by the joint spectrum of the Gaudin Hamiltonians treating them as algebraic curves. We write equations of these curves as determinants of tridiagonal matrices and observe that their branch points form remarkable patterns.</description>

      <title>Commutator-based operator splitting for linear port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The port-Hamiltonian approach offers a modeling of dynamic systems with an energy-conserving and a dissipative part. Port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems are passive. That means no energy can be generated within the system. A passive system cannot store more energy than it receives. The exact solution of the pH system fulfills the dissipation inequality. In this paper, we deal with operator splitting that considers the energy-conserving and dissipative parts separately. We aim at high-order splitting schemes that preserve the dissipation inequality. Fourth-order methods for linear pHs-ODE are derived and an extension to sixth-order methods is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effectin Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and the two-point function plateau for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain precise plateau estimates for the two-point function of the finite-volume weakly-coupled hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions $d \ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions, and for any number $n \ge 1$ of components of the field $\varphi$. We prove that, within a critical window around their respective effective critical points, the two-point functions for both free and periodic boundary conditions have a plateau, in the sense that they decay as $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ until reaching a constant plateau value of order $V^{-1/2}$ (with a logarithmic correction for $d=4$), where $V$ is size of the finite volume. The two critical windows for free and periodic boundary conditions do not overlap. The dependence of the plateau height on the location within the critical window is governed by an explicit $n$-dependent universal profile which is independent of the dimension. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalisation group method and extends the method used by Michta, Park and Slade (arXiv:2306.00896) to study the finite-volume susceptibility and related quantities. Our results lead to precise conjectures concerning Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models of spin systems and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d \ge 4$.</description>

      <title>The torus plateau for the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus of volume $r^d$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$ and for large $r$, in the vicinity of the infinite-volume critical point $\beta_c$. We prove that for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ (with a suitable constant) the susceptibility is bounded above and below by multiples of $r^{d/2}$, and that the two-point function has a ``plateau'' in the sense that it decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ when $|x|$ is small relative to the volume but for larger $|x|$ it levels off to a constant value of order $r^{-d/2}$. We also prove that at $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ the renormalised coupling constant is nonzero, which implies a non-Gaussian limit for the average spin. The proof relies on near-critical estimates for the infinite-volume two-point function obtained recently by Duminil-Copin and Panis, and builds upon a strategy proposed by Papathanakos. The random current representation of the Ising model plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Taub-NUT Instanton as the Self-dual Analog of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that a certain vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime, which may be regarded as a self-dual analog of the Kerr metric, is equivalent to the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton. We confirm this conjecture by applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to each metric and showing that for suitable choices of null tetrad, the algorithm leads to the same invariants and linear isotropy groups for both, establishing their equivalence. While it is well-known that the Taub-NUT solution and its self-dual version admit a double Kerr-Schild form, the observation that the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton admits a single Kerr-Schild form has only been made very recently. The two metrics we compare may be regarded as either complex metrics with Lorentzian (1,3) signature or real metrics with Kleinian (2,2) signature; here we take the latter view. Significant simplifications occur when the null tetrads are chosen to consist of two pairs of complex conjugate null vectors rather than four real independent ones. As a bonus, our work provides the first example of applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm using a null tetrad of this type.</description>

      <title>A Gluing Problem for a Gauged Hyperbolic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project, we study the hyperbolic Abelian Higgs model in dimension $3$ at the critical coupling. The stationary solutions to the two-dimensional version of this equation have been found by Jaffe and Taubes, the so called $N$-vortex configurations. One can consider the space of all $N$-vortex configurations $M_N$ as a smooth Riemannian manifold. Stuart has proved that near the critical coupling regime, the dynamic in dimension $2$ can be approximated by a finite dimensional Hamiltonian system on the moduli space $M_2$, for suitable initial data. In this thesis, we study how to glue the $N$-vortex configurations to construct dynamical solutions in dimension $3$. Namely, we prove that if $q:[0,T)\times \mathbb{R}\to M_N$ is a wave map, then for $\epsilon&gt;0$ small enough, there exists a solution of the Abelian Higgs model in dimension $(1+3)$ on $[0,\frac{T_0}{\epsilon})\times \mathbb{R}^3$ for some $T_0&gt;0$ which is close to $(\phi,\alpha)(.;q(\epsilon t,\epsilon z))$ in terms of $\epsilon$, where $(\phi,\alpha)(.)$ denotes the variables of the corresponding $N$-vortex configuration. Furthermore, the other gauge field variables are small in terms of $\epsilon$. This dissertation has been supervised by Prof. Robert Jerrard.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to model reduction of Generalized Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical model of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics accounting for non-Markovian effects, which is referred to as the Generalized Langevin Equation in the literature. We derive reduced Markovian descriptions obtained through the neglection of inertial terms and/or heat bath variables. The adopted reduction scheme relies on the framework of the Invariant Manifold method, which allows to retain the slow degrees of freedom from a multiscale dynamical system. Our approach is also rooted on the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, which helps preserve the proper dissipative structure of the reduced dynamics. We highlight the appropriate time scalings introduced within our procedure, and also prove the commutativity of selected reduction paths.</description>

      <title>Bending-Neutral Deformations of Minimal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Here they are considered as geometric objects that bear a deformation content. By refining the resolution of the surface deformation gradient afforded by the polar decomposition theorem, we identify a bending content and a class of deformations that leave it unchanged. These are the bending-neutral deformations, fully characterized by an integrability condition. We prove that (1) every minimal surface is transformed into a minimal surface by a bending-neutral deformation and (2) given two minimal surfaces, there is a bending-neutral deformation that maps one into the other. Thus, all minimal surfaces have indeed a universal bending content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local spectral statistics in the localised region of various random operator models, including the $d$-dimensional the Anderson model and random Schr\"odinger operators. It is already established, in the above models, that at an energy $E$, in the localised energy region of the spectrum, where the density of states $n(E) &gt; 0$, the local eigenvalue statistics $X_E$ is a Poisson processes with intensity $n(E) \mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{L}$ being the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The question of independence of $X_E, X_{E^\prime}$ for distinct energies was partially solved in the literature. We solve it completely for all the models for which the Minami technique works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by experimental evidence collected when processing thin films from ternary solutions made of two solutes, typically polymers, and one solvent, we computationally study the morphology formation of domains obtained in three-state systems using both a lattice model and a continuum counterpart. The lattice-based approach relies on the Blume-Capel nearest neighbor model with bulk conservative Kawasaki dynamics, whereas as continuum system we consider a coupled system of evolution equations that is derived as hydrodynamic limit when replacing the nearest neighbor interaction in the lattice case by a suitable Kac potential. We explore how the obtained morphology depends on the solvent content in the mixture. In particular, we study how these scenarios change when the solvent is allowed to evaporate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit model of quantum computation can be interpreted as a scattering process. In particular, factorised scattering operators result in integrable quantum circuits that provide universal quantum computation and are potentially less noisy. These are realized through Yang-Baxter or 2-simplex operators. A natural question is to extend this construction to higher qubit gates, like the Toffoli gates, which also lead to universal quantum computation but with shallower circuits. We show that unitary families of such operators are constructed by the 3-dimensional generalizations of the Yang-Baxter operators known as tetrahedron or 3-simplex operators. The latter satisfy a spectral parameter-dependent tetrahedron equation. This construction goes through for $n$-Toffoli gates realized using $n$-simplex operators.</description>

      <title>Doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang models, Born-selfdual $\kappa$-deformed quantum phase spaces and two generalizations of Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that by using two different realizations of $\hat{o}(1,4)$ Lie algebra one can describe one-parameter standard Snyder model and two-parameter $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model. In this paper, by using the generalized Born duality and Jacobi identities we obtain from the $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model the doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang model which provides the new class of quantum relativistic phase spaces. These phase spaces contain as subalgebras the $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space-time as well as quantum $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformed fourmomenta and are depending on five independent parameters. Such a large class of quantum phase spaces can be described in $D=4$ by particular realizations of $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebra, what illustrates the property that in noncommutative geometry different $D=4$ physical models may be described by various realizations of the same algebraic structure. Finally, in the last Section we propose two new ways of generalizing Yang models: by introducing $\hat o(1,3+2N)$ algebras ($N=1,2\ldots$) we provide internal symmetries $O(N)$ symmetries in Kaluza-Klein extended Yang model, and by replacing the classical $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebras which describe the algebraic structure of Yang models by $\hat o(1,5)$ quantum groups with suitably chosen nonprimitive coproducts.</description>

      <title>Zhukovsky-Volterra top and quantisation ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we revisit the quantisation problem for a fundamental model of classical mechanics - the Zhukovsky-Volterra top. We have discovered a four-parametric pencil of compatible Poisson brackets, comprising two quadratic and two linear Poisson brackets. Using the quantisation ideal method, we have identified two distinct quantisations of the Zhukovsky-Volterra top. The first type corresponds to the universal enveloping algebras of $so(3)$, leading to Lie-Poisson brackets in the classical limit. The second type can be regarded as a quantisation of the four-parametric inhomogeneous quadratic Poisson pencil. We discuss the relationships between the quantisations obtained in our paper, Sklyanin's quantisation of the Euler top, and Levin-Olshanetsky-Zotov's quantisation of the Zhukovsky-Volterra top.</description>

      <title>The Chern-Simons Functional Integral, Kauffman's Bracket Polynomial, and other link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chern-Simons Gauge Theory in axial gauge on ${\mathbb R}^3.$ This theory has a quadratic Lagrangian and therefore expectations can be computed nonperturbatively by explicit formulas, giving an (unbounded) linear functional on a space of polynomial functions in the gauge fields, as a mathematically well-defined avatar of the formal functional integral. We use differential-geometric methods to extend the definition of this linear functional to expectations of products of Wilson loops corresponding to oriented links in ${\mathbb R}^3,$ and derive skein relations for them. In the case $G=SU(2)$ we show that these skein relations are closely related to those of the Kauffman bracket polynomial, which is closely related to the Jones polynomial. We also study the case of groups of higher rank. We note that in the absence of a cubic term in the action, there is no quantization condition on the coupling $\lambda,$ which can be any complex number. This is in line with the fact that the Jones polynomial, in contrast to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, is defined for any value of the coupling. The appearance of the parameter $e^{\frac1{2\lambda}}$ in the expectations and skein relations is also natural. Likewise, the extension of the theory to noncompact groups presents no difficulties. Finally we show how computations similar to ours, but for gauge fields in two dimensions, yield the Goldman bracket.</description>

      <title>Locality, Correlations, Information, and non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems generically exhibit breakdown of Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds, motivating study of whether new locality measures might shed light not seen by existing measures. In this paper we discuss extensions of the connected correlation function (CC) as measures of locality and information spreading in both Hermitian and NH systems. We find that in Hermitian systems, $\delta\rho = \rho-\rho_A\otimes\rho_B$ can be written as a linear combination of CCs, allowing placement of a LR bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$, which we show generically extends to a LR bound on mutual information. Additionally, we extend the CC to NH systems in a form that recovers locality, and use the metric formalism to derive a modified CC which recovers not just locality but even LR bounds. We find that even with these CCs, the bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$ breaks down in certain NH cases, which can be used to place a necessary condition on which NH Hamiltonians are capable of nonlocal entanglement generation. Numerical simulations are provided by means of exact diagonalization for the NH Transverse-Field Ising Model, demonstrating both breakdown and recovery of LR bounds.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Gamma conjecture I and its underlying Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ for the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles $X_n=\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(n))$ with $n\ge 3$. We show that Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ does not hold if $n$ is odd, and that Gamma conjecture I does not hold if $n$ is even. Led by this example, we propose modifications for Gamma conjecture I, discuss Gamma conjecture I over the Kahler moduli space, and identify the corresponding principal asymptotic class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

      <title>On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found. The reported relations have potential application in geophysics, astrophysics, electrostatics and solid state physics (e.g. ferroic inclusions).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dimension reduction of instantons over product manifolds with calibrated factors. We first prove an integrability result that relates dimension reduction with curvature conditions. Then we find a topological criterion for bundles over product manifolds to admit instantons that satisfy the aforementioned curvature conditions; in particular, pull-back bundles satisfy this criterion. Consequently, we deduce explicit descriptions for the moduli space of Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, G2-, and Spin(7)-instantons in various contexts, and establish well-behaved compactifications for these moduli spaces when one factor of the product manifold is a hyperk\"ahler surface.</description>

For a concrete example of the potential, we give a more explicit index formula, showing that the Witten index assumes any real number on this class of operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay estimates of macroscopic quantities generated by the solutions to linear transport equations driven by a general family of Hamiltonians. The associated particle trajectories are all trapped in a compact region of phase-space and feature a non-degenerate elliptic stagnation point. The analysis covers a large class of Hamiltonians generated by the radially symmetric compactly supported equilibria of the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system. Working in radial symmetry, our analysis features both the 1+2-dimensional case and the harder 1+1-dimensional case, where all the particles have the same value of the modulus of angular momentum. The latter case is also of importance in both the plasma physics case and two dimensional incompressible fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Statistical conformal Killing Vector Fields for FLRW Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of conformal Killing vector fields for FLRW space-time from Riemannian point of view was done by Maartens-Maharaj in \cite{Maartens1986}. In this paper, we introduce conformal Killing vector fields from a new point of view for the FLRW space-time. In particular, we consider three cases for the conformal factor. Then, it is shown that there exist nine conformal vector fields on FLRW in total, such that six of them are Killing and the rest being non-Killing conformal vector fields. Consequently, by recalling the concept of statistical conformal Killing vector fields introduced in \cite{SP}, we classify statistical structures with repsect to which these vector fields are conformal Killing. We also obtain the form of affine connections that feature a vanishing Lie derivative with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields. Imposing the torsion-free and the Codazzi conditions on these connections, we study statistical structures on FLRW. Finally, for torsionful connections we study the vanishing of the Lie derivative of the torsion tensor with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields and derive the conditions under which this is valid.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the boundary value problem of elliptic equation by Levi function scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For boundary value problem of an elliptic equation with variable coefficients describing the physical field distribution in inhomogeneous media, the Levi function can represent the solution in terms of volume and surface potentials, with the drawback that the volume potential involving in the solution expression requires heavy computational costs as well as the solvability of the integral equations with respect to the density pair. We introduce an modified integral expression for the solution to an elliptic equation in divergence form under the Levi function framework. The well-posedness of the linear integral system with respect to the density functions to be determined is rigorously proved. Based on the singularity decomposition for the Levi function, we propose two schemes to deal with the volume integrals so that the density functions can be solved efficiently. One method is an adaptive discretization scheme (ADS) for computing the integrals with continuous integrands, leading to the uniform accuracy of the integrals in the whole domain, and consequently the efficient computations for the density functions. The other method is the dual reciprocity method (DRM) which is a meshless approach converting the volume integrals into boundary integrals equivalently by expressing the volume density as the combination of the radial basis functions determined by the interior grids. The proposed schemes are justified numerically to be of satisfactory computation costs. Numerical examples in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cases are presented to show the validity of the proposed schemes.</description>

The state space we use contains states with negative norm and polarized sections determine a Hilbert space.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjectured classification of topological phases in two spatial dimensions with gappable boundary, in a simplified setting. Two gapped ground states of lattice Hamiltonians are in the same quantum phase of matter, or topological phase, if they can be connected by a constant-depth quantum circuit. It is conjectured that the Levin-Wen string-net models exhaust all possible gapped phases with gappable boundary, and these phases are labeled by unitary modular tensor categories. We prove this under the assumption that every phase has a representative state with zero correlation length satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, or a strict form of area law. Our main technical development is to transform these states into string-net states using constant-depth quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bond percolation model on transient weighted graphs ${G}$ induced by the excursion sets of the Gaussian free field on the corresponding metric graph. Under the sole assumption that its sign clusters do not percolate, we derive an extension of Lupu's formula for the two-point function at criticality. We then focus on the low-dimensional case $0&lt; \nu &lt; \frac{\alpha}{2}$, where $\alpha$ governs the polynomial volume growth of $G$ and $\nu$ the decay rate of the Green's function on $G$. In particular, this includes the benchmark case ${G}=\mathbb{Z}^3$, for which $\alpha=3$ and $\nu= \alpha-2=1$. We prove under these assumptions that the critical one-arm probability decays with distance $R$ like $R^{-\frac{\nu}{2}}$, up to multiplicative constants.</description>

Abstract: Via Andersen-Borot-Orantin's geometric recursion, a twist of the topological recursion was proposed, and a recursion for the Masur-Veech polynomials was uncovered. The purpose of this article is to explore generalizations of Mirzakhani's recursion based on physical two-dimensional gravity models related to the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to provide an introduction to various realizations of topological recursion. For generalized Mirzakhani's recursions involving a Masur-Veech type twist, we derive Virasoro constraints and cut-and-join equations, and also show some computations of generalized volumes for the physical two-dimensional gravity models.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and universal finite-size scaling for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse and clarify the finite-size scaling of the weakly-coupled hierarchical $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model for all integers $n \ge 1$ in all dimensions $d\ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions. For $d&gt;4$, we prove that for a volume of size $R^{d}$ with periodic boundary conditions the infinite-volume critical point is an effective finite-volume critical point, whereas for free boundary conditions the effective critical point is shifted smaller by an amount of order $R^{-2}$. For both boundary conditions, the average field has the same non-Gaussian limit within a critical window of width $R^{-d/2}$ around the effective critical point, and in that window we compute the universal scaling profile for the susceptibility. In contrast, and again for both boundary conditions, the average field has a massive Gaussian limit when above the effective critical point by an amount $R^{-2}$. In particular, at the infinite-volume critical point the susceptibility scales as $R^{d/2}$ for periodic boundary conditions and as $R^{2}$ for free boundary conditions. We identify a mass generation mechanism for free boundary conditions that is responsible for this distinction and which we believe has wider validity, in particular to Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 4$. For $d=4$ we prove a similar picture with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis is based on the rigorous renormalisation group method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade, which we improve and extend.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. We let $\mathcal{S}$ be \begin{equation} \mathcal{S} = \{ r , k , c_{0} , c_{1}, .... c_{r} \} \nonumber \end{equation} with $r$ an integer $\ge 1$, $k$ an integer $\ge 1$, and $c_{i}$ real numbers. For such a set $\mathcal{S}$ we define an approximation to $b(n)$, $\hat{b}(n)$ = $\hat{b}(n, \mathcal{S})$ by \begin{equation}\label{A1} \tag{A1} \hat{b}(n) = \begin{cases}
  b(n) ,&amp;\quad n &lt; k
  f(n), &amp;\quad n\geq k \end{cases} \end{equation} with \begin{equation}\label{A2} \tag{A2}
  f(n)=(-1)^{n-k+1} b(k-1) \prod\limits_{i=k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{i} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{i^{r}}\right) \end{equation} Herein we study the limited problem with $k = 11-r$, $r \leq 6$, and d in the set $\{1,2,3,5,11,20\}$. In this situation we also choose the $\{c_{i}\}$ such that $f(n) = b(n)$ for $n \leq 11$. This determines the $ c(i)$ uniquely, We hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. We will present some physicists' intuitions behind the form of our approximations. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>

      <title>A new approach to topological T-duality for principal torus bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new `Thom class' formulation of topological T-duality for principal torus bundles. This definition is equivalent to the established one of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick but has the virtue of removing the global assumptions on the H-flux required in the old definition. With the new definition, we provide easier and more transparent proofs of the classification of T-duals and generalise the local formulation of T-duality for circle bundles by Bunke, Schick, and Spitzweck to the torus case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, \omega, J)$ be a K\"ahler manifold, equipped with an effective Hamiltonian torus action $\rho: T \rightarrow \mathrm{Diff}(M, \omega, J)$ by isometries with moment map $\mu: M \rightarrow \mathfrak{t}^{*}$. We first construct a singular mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ on $M$. Second, we construct a one-parameter family of complex structures $J_{t}$ on $M$ which are compatible with $\omega$. Furthermore, the path of corresponding K\"ahler metrics $g_{t}$ is a complete geodesic ray in the space of K\"ahler metrics of $M$, when $M$ is compact. Finally, we show that the corresponding family of K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{t}$ associated to $J_{t}$ converges to $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a generic random system, the coexistence of extended and localized states can be evidenced by the subextensive width of energy distribution of a physical initial state in, for example, the quantum quenches which involving the local Hamiltonian. The robust thermalization is also evidenced in terms of the microscopic canonical ensemble average in the thermalization limit\cite{Shiraishi}, which satisfies the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In this article, we study the method of two-particle self-consistency for a system without condensation, i.e., without the inaccessible localizations that violating the ETH. We provide another pespective that considering the local conservation of an nonintegrable system the stubborn correlations between the three kinds of decompositions for the four-point functions, which can be regarded as the elements in a product of the self-energy and Green function matrices (i.e., the two-particle correlations in Kadanoff and Baym notation\cite{Vilk Y M}).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the real eigenvalues of the elliptic Ginibre matrix indexed by the non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$, and present a Harer-Zagier type recursion formula for the even moments in the form of an $11$-term recurrence relation. For the symmetric GOE case ($\tau=1$), it reduces to a known 5-term recurrence relation. On the other hand, for the asymmetric cases when $\tau &lt; 1$, the recursion formula is new, even in the special case of the well-studied Ginibre ensemble ($\tau=0$), where it reduces to a 3-term recurrence. For the proof, we derive a seventh-order linear differential equation for the moment generating function.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in novel Clifford geometric invariants of linear transformations. This motivates the investigation of such invariants for a certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root systems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter transformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter transformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple roots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This computational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using techniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal component analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined by the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding reflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping. This provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that the datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a pump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing that such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and shedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known geometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological T-duality is a relationship between pairs (E, P ) over a fixed space X, where E over X is a principal torus bundle and P over E is a twist, such as a gerbe of principal PU(H)-bundle. This is of interest to topologists because of the T-duality transformation: a T-duality relation between pairs (E, P ) and (F, Q ) comes with an isomorphism (with degree shift) between the twisted K-theory of E and the twisted K-theory of F. We formulate topological T-duality in the equivariant setting, following the definition of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick. We define the T-duality transformation in equivariant K-theory and show that it is an isomorphism for actions of compact Lie groups, equal to its own inverse and uniquely characterized by naturality and a normalization for trivial situations.</description>

Abstract: We show under the assumption of small data that solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system with a pure magnetic field and Bianchi I symmetry isotropise and tend to dust solutions. We also obtain the decay rates for the main variables. This generalises part of the work [V.~G.~LeBlanc, Classical Quantum Gravity 14, 2281-2301 (1997)] concerning the future behaviour of orthogonal perfect fluids with a linear equation of state in the presence of a magnetic field to the Vlasov case.</description>

      <title>Temporal coupled-mode theory in nonlinear resonant photonics: From basic principles to contemporary systems with 2D materials, dispersion, loss, and gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is an acclaimed and widely used theoretical framework for modeling the continuous wave (CW) response and temporal dynamics of any integrated or free-space photonic resonant structure. It was initially employed to understand how energy is coupled into and out of a cavity and how it is exchanged between different resonant modes. In the 30 years that followed its establishment, CMT has been expanded to describe a broad range of nonlinear interactions as well (self- and cross-phase modulation, saturable absorption, frequency generation, gain, etc.). In this tutorial, we thoroughly present the basic principles and the evolution of CMT throughout the years, showcasing its immense capabilities for the analysis and design of linear and nonlinear resonant photonic systems. Importantly, we focus on examples of modern, open nanophotonic resonators incorporating contemporary bulk or sheet (2D) materials that may be lossy and dispersive. For each linear/nonlinear effect under study we follow a meticulous, step-by-step approach, starting from an accurate model of the physical phenomenon and proceeding to its introduction in the CMT framework all the way to the efficient solution of the resulting system of equations. Our work highlights the merits of CMT as an efficient, accurate, and versatile theoretical tool. We envision that it can serve both as an introductory reference for any reader, as well as a comprehensive handbook on how to incorporate a broad range of linear and nonlinear effects in the CMT framework.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general procedure to study double integrals arising when considering wave propagation in periodic structures. This method, based on a complex deformation of the integration surface to bypass the integrands' singularities, is particularly efficient to estimate the Green's functions of such structures in the far field. We provide several illustrative examples and explicit asymptotic formulae. Special attention is devoted to the pathological cases of degeneracies, such as Dirac conical points for instance.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>

Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>
