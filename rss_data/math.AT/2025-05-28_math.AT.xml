      <title>Holes in Latent Space: Topological Signatures Under Adversarial Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how adversarial conditions affect language models requires techniques that capture both global structure and local detail within high-dimensional activation spaces. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, to systematically characterize multiscale latent space dynamics in LLMs under two distinct attack modes -- backdoor fine-tuning and indirect prompt injection. By analyzing six state-of-the-art LLMs, we show that adversarial conditions consistently compress latent topologies, reducing structural diversity at smaller scales while amplifying dominant features at coarser ones. These topological signatures are statistically robust across layers, architectures, model sizes, and align with the emergence of adversarial effects deeper in the network. To capture finer-grained mechanisms underlying these shifts, we introduce a neuron-level PH framework that quantifies how information flows and transforms within and across layers. Together, our findings demonstrate that PH offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting representational dynamics in LLMs, particularly under distributional shift.</description>

      <title>Global representation theory: Homological foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the groups belonging to some collection of finite groups $\mathscr{U}$. Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Comonadic Coalgebras and Bousfield Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.11536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a model category, we prove that taking the category of coalgebras over a comonad commutes with left Bousfield localization in a suitable sense. Then we prove a general existence result for the left-induced model structure on the category of coalgebras over a comonad in a left Bousfield localization. Next we provide several equivalent characterizations of when a left Bousfield localization preserves coalgebras over a comonad. These results are illustrated with many applications in chain complexes, (localized) spectra, the stable module category, and simplicial settings.</description>

      <title>The homology of permutation racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite a blossoming of research activity on racks and their homology for over two decades, with a record of diverse applications to central parts of contemporary mathematics, there are still very few examples of racks whose homology has been fully calculated. In this paper, we compute the entire integral homology of all permutation racks. Our method of choice involves homotopical algebra, which was brought to bear on the homology of racks only recently. For our main result, we establish a spectral sequence, which reduces the problem to one in equivariant homology, and for which we show that it always degenerates. The blueprint given in this paper demonstrates the high potential for further exploitation of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Bredon motivic cohomology of the real numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the real numbers with $\Z/2-$coefficients, we compute the $C_2$-equivariant Borel motivic cohomology ring, the Bredon motivic cohomology groups and prove that the Bredon motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers is a proper subring in the $RO(C_2\times C_2)$-graded Bredon cohomology ring of a point.
  This generalizes Voevodsky's computation of the motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers to the $C_2$-equivariant setting. These computations are extended afterwards to any real closed field.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bounded cohomology and the stable commutator length of verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W}A$, where $A$ has trivial bounded cohomology for a sufficiently large class of coefficients.\\ We prove that the stable commutator length always vanishes, and that the bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees for some such verbal wreath products; including the standard restricted wreath products (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups), as well as verbal wreath products arising from n-solvable, $n$-nilpotent, and $k$-Burnside $(k = 2, 3, 4, 6)$ verbal products.\ As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in positive degrees for a large class of coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Yoneda embedding in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riehl and Shulman introduced simplicial type theory (STT), a variant of homotopy type theory which aimed to study not just homotopy theory, but its fusion with category theory: $(\infty,1)$-category theory. While notoriously technical, manipulating $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory is often easier than working with ordinary categories, with the type theory handling infinite stacks of coherences in the background. We capitalize on recent work by Gratzer et al. defining the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids in STT to define presheaf categories within STT and systematically develop their theory. In particular, we construct the Yoneda embedding, prove the universal property of presheaf categories, refine the theory of adjunctions in STT, introduce the theory of Kan extensions, and prove Quillen's Theorem A.</description>

      <title>HiPoNet: A Multi-View Simplicial Complex Network for High Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose HiPoNet, an end-to-end differentiable neural network for regression, classification, and representation learning on high-dimensional point clouds. Our work is motivated by single-cell data which can have very high-dimensionality --exceeding the capabilities of existing methods for point clouds which are mostly tailored for 3D data. Moreover, modern single-cell and spatial experiments now yield entire cohorts of datasets (i.e., one data set for every patient), necessitating models that can process large, high-dimensional point-clouds at scale. Most current approaches build a single nearest-neighbor graph, discarding important geometric and topological information. In contrast, HiPoNet models the point-cloud as a set of higher-order simplicial complexes, with each particular complex being created using a reweighting of features. This method thus generates multiple constructs corresponding to different views of high-dimensional data, which in biology offers the possibility of disentangling distinct cellular processes. It then employs simplicial wavelet transforms to extract multiscale features, capturing both local and global topology from each view. We show that geometric and topological information is preserved in this framework both theoretically and empirically. We showcase the utility of HiPoNet on point-cloud level tasks, involving classification and regression of entire point-clouds in data cohorts. Experimentally, we find that HiPoNet outperforms other point-cloud and graph-based models on single-cell data. We also apply HiPoNet to spatial transcriptomics datasets using spatial coordinates as one of the views. Overall, HiPoNet offers a robust and scalable solution for high-dimensional data analysis.</description>
