      <title>A generalized non-hourglass updated Lagrangian formulation for SPH solid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hourglass modes, characterized by zigzag particle and stress distributions, are a common numerical instability encountered when simulating solid materials with updated Lagrangian smoother particle hydrodynamics (ULSPH). While recent solutions have effectively addressed this issue in elastic materials using an essentially non-hourglass formulation, extending these solutions to plastic materials with more complex constitutive equations has proven challenging due to the need to express shear forces in the form of a velocity Laplacian. To address this, a generalized non-hourglass formulation is proposed within the ULSPH framework, suitable for both elastic and plastic materials. Specifically, a penalty force is introduced into the momentum equation to resolve the disparity between the linearly predicted and actual velocities of neighboring particle pairs, thereby mitigating the hourglass issue. The stability, convergence, and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a series of classical elastic and plastic cases, with a dual-criterion time-stepping scheme to improve computational efficiency. The results show that the present method not only matches or even surpasses the performance of the recent essentially non-hourglass formulation in elastic cases but also performs well in plastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grid Graph Neural Networks with Self-Attention for Computational Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancement in finite element methods have become essential in various disciplines, and in particular for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), driving research efforts for improved precision and efficiency. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found success in CFD by mapping meshes into images, recent attention has turned to leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for direct mesh processing. This paper introduces a novel model merging Self-Attention with Message Passing in GNNs, achieving a 15\% reduction in RMSE on the well known flow past a cylinder benchmark. Furthermore, a dynamic mesh pruning technique based on Self-Attention is proposed, that leads to a robust GNN-based multigrid approach, also reducing RMSE by 15\%. Additionally, a new self-supervised training method based on BERT is presented, resulting in a 25\% RMSE reduction. The paper includes an ablation study and outperforms state-of-the-art models on several challenging datasets, promising advancements similar to those recently achieved in natural language and image processing. Finally, the paper introduces a dataset with meshes larger than existing ones by at least an order of magnitude. Code and Datasets will be released at https://github.com/DonsetPG/multigrid-gnn.</description>

      <title>AirLift: A Fast and Comprehensive Technique for Remapping Alignments between Reference Genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.08735v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AirLift is the first read remapping tool that enables users to quickly and comprehensively map a read set, that had been previously mapped to one reference genome, to another similar reference. Users can then quickly run a downstream analysis of read sets for each latest reference release. Compared to the state-of-the-art method for remapping reads (i.e., full mapping), AirLift reduces the overall execution time to remap read sets between two reference genome versions by up to 27.4x. We validate our remapping results with GATK and find that AirLift provides high accuracy in identifying ground truth SNP/INDEL variants
  AirLift source code and readme describing how to reproduce our results are available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/AirLift.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>Differential Inversion of the Implicit Euler Method: Symbolic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implicit Euler method integrates systems of ordinary differential equations $$\frac{d x}{d t}=G(t,x(t))$$ with differentiable right-hand side $G : {\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n$ from an initial state $x=x(0) \in {\mathbb R}^n$ to a target time $t \in {\mathbb R}$ as $x(t)=E(t,m,x)$ using an equidistant discretization of the time interval $[0,t]$ yielding $m&gt;0$ time steps. We present a method for efficiently computing the product of its inverse Jacobian $$(E')^{-1} \equiv \left (\frac{d E}{d x}\right )^{-1} \in {\mathbb R}^{n \times n} $$ with a given vector $v \in {\mathbb R}^n.$ We show that the differential inverse $(E')^{-1} \cdot v$ can be evaluated for given $v \in {\mathbb R}^n$ with a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^2)$ as opposed to the standard $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^3)$ or, naively, even $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^4).$ The theoretical results are supported by actual run times. A reference implementation is provided.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations.</description>
