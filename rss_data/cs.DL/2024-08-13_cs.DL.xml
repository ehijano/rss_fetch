      <title>The Literature Review Network: An Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Systematic Literature Reviews, Meta-analyses, and Method Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic literature reviews are the highest quality of evidence in research. However, the review process is hindered by significant resource and data constraints. The Literature Review Network (LRN) is the first of its kind explainable AI platform adhering to PRISMA 2020 standards, designed to automate the entire literature review process. LRN was evaluated in the domain of surgical glove practices using 3 search strings developed by experts to query PubMed. A non-expert trained all LRN models. Performance was benchmarked against an expert manual review. Explainability and performance metrics assessed LRN's ability to replicate the experts' review. Concordance was measured with the Jaccard index and confusion matrices. Researchers were blinded to the other's results until study completion. Overlapping studies were integrated into an LRN-generated systematic review. LRN models demonstrated superior classification accuracy without expert training, achieving 84.78% and 85.71% accuracy. The highest performance model achieved high interrater reliability (k = 0.4953) and explainability metrics, linking 'reduce', 'accident', and 'sharp' with 'double-gloving'. Another LRN model covered 91.51% of the relevant literature despite diverging from the non-expert's judgments (k = 0.2174), with the terms 'latex', 'double' (gloves), and 'indication'. LRN outperformed the manual review (19,920 minutes over 11 months), reducing the entire process to 288.6 minutes over 5 days. This study demonstrates that explainable AI does not require expert training to successfully conduct PRISMA-compliant systematic literature reviews like an expert. LRN summarized the results of surgical glove studies and identified themes that were nearly identical to the clinical researchers' findings. Explainable AI can accurately expedite our understanding of clinical practices, potentially revolutionizing healthcare research.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Map on Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of Big Data has been established as a solid field of studies in many areas such as healthcare, science, transport, education, government services, among others. Despite widely discussed, there is no agreed definition about the paradigm although there are many concepts proposed by the academy and industry. This work aims to provide an analytical view of the studies conducted and published regarding the Big Data paradigm. The approach used is the systematic map of the literature, combining bibliometric analysis and content analysis to depict the panorama of research works, identifying patterns, trends, and gaps. The results indicate that there is still a long way to go, both in research and in concepts, such as building and defining adequate infrastructures and standards, to meet future challenges and for the paradigm to become effective and bring the expected benefits.</description>

      <title>COARA will not save science from the tyranny of administrative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Could the generalized adoption of the COARA principles make administrative research evaluation socially desirable and solve all its problems? The answer to this question is no. To reach this conclusion, two main arguments are discussed. The first characterises COARA as a form of 'technocracy' perfectly consistent with a neo-liberal view of research. The second consists in the adoption of Philip Kitcher's idea of well-ordered science. It is argued that administrative evaluation of research, even if correct on the basis of COARA principles, is at odds with the principles of well-ordered science since it cannot escape neither the tyranny of expertise nor the tyranny of ignorance. These two arguments allow to suggest limiting administrative evaluation to the bare minimum (recruitment of researchers and funding of projects), and to focus attention mainly to the fairness of evaluation procedures.</description>

      <title>A Metascience Study of the Impact of Low-Code Techniques in Modeling Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last years, model-related publications have been exploring the application of modeling techniques in different domains. Initially focused on UML and the Model-Driven Architecture approach, the literature has been evolving towards the usage of more general concepts such as Model-Driven Development or Model-Driven Engineering. With the emergence of Low-Code software development platforms, the modeling community has been studying how these two fields may combine and benefit from each other, thus leading to the publication of a number of works in recent years. In this paper, we present a metascience study of Low-Code. Our study has a two-fold approach: (1) to examine the composition (size and diversity) of the emerging Low-Code community; and (2) to investigate how this community differs from the "classical" model-driven community in terms of people, venues, and types of publications. Through this study, we aim to benefit the low-code community by helping them better understand its relationship with the broader modeling community. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a discussion about the current and possible future evolution of the low-code community as part of its consolidation as a new research field.</description>
