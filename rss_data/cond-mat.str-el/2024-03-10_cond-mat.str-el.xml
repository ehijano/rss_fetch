      <title>The magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ and its relation to current-induced magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of magnetization using electric fields has been extensively studied in magnetoelectric multiferroic insulator materials. Changes in magnetization in bulk metals caused by electric currents have attracted less attention. The recently discovered metallic magnet Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ has been reported to exhibit current-induced magnetization. Here we determined the magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ using neutron diffraction, aiming to understand the microscopic origin of this magnetoelectric phenomenon in a metal. We established that the antiferromagnetic order emerging below $T_N=5$ K is a cycloid order described by $P6_3/mcm.1'(0,0,g)00sss$ with small moment sizes of $0.50(2)~\mu_B$ and propagation vector ${\bf k}=(0,0,0.386)$. Surprisingly, the symmetry of this magnetic structure is inconsistent with the presence of current-induced magnetization and potential origins of this inconsistency with previous results are discussed. Additionally, our results suggest that moments order along their hard magnetic direction in Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$, a phenomenon which has been observed in other Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice-commensurate skyrmion texture in a centrosymmetric breathing kagome magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmion lattices (SkL) in centrosymmetric materials typically have a magnetic period on the nanometer-scale, so that the coupling between magnetic superstructures and the underlying crystal lattice cannot be neglected. Here, we reveal the commensurate locking of a SkL to the atomic lattice in Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ via high-resolution resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). Weak easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, demonstrated here by a combination of ferromagnetic resonance and REXS, penalizes placing a skyrmion core on a site of the atomic lattice. Under these conditions, a commensurate SkL, locked to the crystal lattice, is stable at finite temperatures -- but gives way to a competing incommensurate ground state upon cooling. We discuss the role of Umklapp-terms in the Hamiltonian for the formation of this lattice-locked state, its magnetic space group, the role of slight discommensurations, or (line) defects in the magnetic texture, and contrast our findings with the case of SkLs in noncentrosymmetric material platforms.</description>

      <title>Trapping Hard-Core Bosons in Flatband Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate 1D and 2D cross-stitch lattices with hard-core bosons and analytically construct exact groundstates that feature macroscopic degeneracy. The construction relies on the presence of a flatband in the single particle spectrum and the orthogonality of the associated compact localized states (CLS). Up to filling fraction $\nu=1/2$, the groundstate is constructed by occupying the CLS. Exactly at $\nu=1/2$, the groundstate becomes a Wigner crystal. For higher filling fractions, the groundstate is constructed by filling the CLS sites completely one by one. Macroscopic degeneracy arises from the multiple choices available when occupying or filling the CLS sites. An occupied CLS acts as an impenetrable barrier for bosons both in 1D and 2D, leading to Hilbert space fragmentation. A similar phenomenology also holds for hard-core bosons on the diamond chain and its higher dimensional generalizations. We also discuss the mapping of these hard-core models onto spin models with quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 string correlations and singlet-triplet gaps of frustrated ladders with ferromagnetic (F) legs and alternate F and AF rungs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frustrated ladder with alternate ferromagnetic(F) exchange $-J_F$ and AF exchange $J_A$ to first neighbors and F exchange $-J_L$ to second neighbors is studied by exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations in systems of $2N$ spins-1/2 with periodic boundary conditions. The ground state is a singlet $(S = 0)$ and the singlet-triplet gap $\varepsilon_T$ is finite for the exchanges considered. Spin-1/2 string correlation functions $g_1(N)$ and $g_2(N)$ are defined for an even number $N$ of consecutive spins in systems with two spins per unit cell; the ladder has string order $g_2(\infty)&gt; 0$ and $g_1(\infty) = 0$. The minimum $N^*$ of $g_2(N)$ is related to the range of ground-state spin correlations. Convergence to $g_2(\infty)$ is from below, and $g_1(N)$ decreases exponentially for $N \geq N^*$. Singlet valence bond (VB) diagrams account for the size dependencies. The frustrated ladder at special values of $J_F$, $J_L$ and $J_A$ reduces to well-known models such as the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet and the $J_1-J_2$ model, among others. Numerical analysis of ladders matches previous results for spin-1 gaps or string correlation functions and extends them to spin-1/2 systems. The nondegenerate singlet ground state of ladder is a bond-order wave, a Kekul\'e VB diagrams at $J_L = J_F/2 \leq J_A$, that is reversed on interchanging $-J_F$ and $J_A$. Inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken in the dimer phase of the $J_1-J_2$ model where the Kekul\'e diagrams are the doubly degenerate ground states at $J_2/J_1 = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General Mechanism and a Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A first-principles study and mesoscopic modeling of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of FeSe within density-functional theory at the generalized gradient approximation level. First, we studied how the bandwidth of the d-bands at the Fermi energy are renormalized by adding simple corrections: Hubbard U, Hunds J and by introducing long-range magnetic orders. We found that introducing either a striped or a staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order brings the bandwidths -- which are starkly overestimated at the generalized gradient approximation level -- closer to those experimentally observed. Second, for the ferromagnetic, the striped, checkerboard and the staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order, we investigate the change in magnetic formation energy with local magnetic moment of Fe at a pressure up to 6 GPa. The bilinear and biquadratic exchange energies are derived from the Heisenberg model and noncollinear first-principles calculations, respectively. We found a non-trivial behavior of the spin-exchange parameters on the magnetization, and we put forward a field-theory model that rationalizes these results in terms of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations. The character of these fluctuations can be either that of a standard density wave or a topological vortex. Topological vortexes can result in mesoscopic magnetization structures.</description>

      <title>Playing nonlocal games across a topological phase transition on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum games provide a natural perspective on phases of matter in quantum hardware, crisply relating the quantum correlations inherent in phases of matter to the securing of quantum advantage at a device-oriented task. In this paper we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging mid-circuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition - witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage - on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed GHZ states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that crossing symmetry of S-matrices is modified in certain theories with non-invertible symmetries or anomalies. Focusing on integrable flows to gapped phases in two dimensions, we find that S-matrices derived previously from the bootstrap approach are incompatible with non-invertible symmetries along the flow. We present consistent alternatives, which however violate standard crossing symmetry and obey modified rules dictated by fusion categories. We extend these rules to theories with discrete anomalies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Bilayer and Trilayer Nickelate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to the pressurized high-temperature superconductivity, bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 2 and 3) exhibit many intriguing properties at ambient pressure, such as orbital-dependent electronic correlation, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and density-wave transitions. Here, using ultrafast reflectivity measurement, we observe a drastic difference between the ultrafast dynamics of the bilayer and trilayer nickelates at ambient pressure. Firstly, we observe a coherent phonon mode in La4Ni3O10 involving the collective vibration of La, Ni, and O atoms, which is absent in La3Ni2O7. Secondly, the temperature-dependent relaxation time diverges near the density-wave transition temperature of La4Ni3O10, in drastic contrast to kink-like changes in La3Ni2O7. Moreover, we estimate the electron-phonon coupling constants to be 0.05~0.07 and 0.12~0.16 for La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, respectively, suggesting a relatively minor role of electron-phonon coupling in the electronic properties of Lan+1NinO3n+1. Our work not only sheds light on the relevant microscopic interaction but also establishes a foundation for further studying the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum many-body scars has received widespread attention both in theoretical and experimental physics in recent years due to its unique physical properties. In this paper, based on the $su(2)$ algebraic relations, we propose a general method for constructing scar models by combining simple modules.This allows us to investigate many-body scar phenomena in high-spin systems. We numerically verify the thermalization and non-integrability of this model and demonstrate the dynamical properties of the scar states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of these scar states. For spin-$1$ case, we find that our 1D chain model reduces to the famous PXP model[C. J. Turner et al. Phys. Rev. B 98, 155134(2018)] under special parameter condition. In addition, due to the continuous tunability of the parameters, our model also enables us to investigate the transitions of QMBS from non-integrable to integrable system.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect arising from antiferromagnetic structure revealed by high-quality NbMnP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials arises from symmetry breaking equivalent to a ferromagnetic (FM) state. Consequently, this suggests that the observed AHE is induced by the intrinsic mechanism of the band structure effect, which in turn induces dissipationless transverse conductivity. Confirmation of impurity-insensitive anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is crucial to conclude this interpretation; however, experimental investigations in AF materials are limited by the lack of high quality systems. In this study, we show that the AF material NbMnP, which exhibits a large AHE, offers a high quality single crystal. Our findings clearly revealed that the large AHC and the tiny net magnetization of $\sim10^{-3} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$/Mn are inherent in this material, irrespective of disorder. NbMnP is a novel AF material that generates FM responses in the regime where there is less impurity scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum embedding for molecules using auxiliary particles -- The ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong/static electronic correlation mediates the emergence of remarkable phases of matter, and underlies the exceptional reactivity properties in transition metal-based catalysts. Modeling strongly correlated molecules and solids calls for multi-reference Ans\"atze, which explicitly capture the competition of energy scales characteristic of such systems. With the efficient computational screening of correlated solids in mind, the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) Ansatz has been recently developed. This is a variational Ansatz which can be formulated as a self-consistent embedding approach, describing the system within a non-interacting, quasiparticle model, yet providing with accurate spectra in both low and high energy regimes. Crucially, small fragments of the system are identified as responsible for the strong correlation, and are therefore enhanced by adding a set of auxiliary orbitals, the ghosts. These capture many-body correlations through one-body fluctuations and subsequent out-projection when computing physical observables. gGut has been shown to accurately describe multi-orbital lattice models at modest computational cost. In this work, we extend the gGut framework to strongly correlated molecules. To adapt the gGut Ansatz for molecular calculations, we address the fact that, unlike in the lattice model previously considered, electronic interactions in molecules are not local. Hence, we explore a hierarchy of approximations of increasing accuracy capturing interactions between fragments and environment, and within the environment, and discuss how these affect the embedding description of correlations in the whole molecule. We will compare the accuracy of the gGut model with established methods to capture strong correlation within active space formulations, and assess the realistic use of this novel approximation to the theoretical description of correlated molecular clusters.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal entanglement across the Mott-Hubbard transition</title>

Abstract: The possibility to directly measure, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, the von Neumann entropy and mutual information between a site and its environment opens new perspectives on the characterization of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, in the framework of quantum information theory. In this work we provide an alternative view of the Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model in terms of rigorous quasilocal measures of entanglement and correlation between two spatially separated electronic orbitals, with no contribution from their environment. A space-resolved analysis of cluster dynamical mean-field theory results elucidates the prominent role of the nearest-neighbor entanglement in probing Mott localization: both its lower and upper bounds sharply increase at the metal-insulator transition. The two-site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors is shown to be quickly damped as the inter-site distance is increased. These results ultimately resolve a conundrum of previous analyses based on the single-site von Neumann entropy, which has been found to monotonically decrease when the interaction is increased. The quasilocal two-site entanglement recovers instead the distinctive character of Mott insulators as strongly correlated quantum states, demonstrating its central role in the $2d$ Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking and ascending in the magnetic kagome metal FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking-the phenomenon where an infinitesimal perturbation can cause the system to break the underlying symmetry-is a cornerstone concept in the understanding of interacting solid-state systems. In a typical series of temperature-driven phase transitions, higher temperature phases are more symmetric due to the stabilizing effect of entropy that becomes dominant as the temperature is increased. However, the opposite is rare but possible when there are multiple degrees of freedom in the system. Here, we present such an example of a symmetry-ascending phenomenon in a magnetic kagome metal FeGe by utilizing neutron Larmor diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In the paramagnetic state at 460K, we confirm that the crystal structure is indeed hexagonal kagome lattice. On cooling to TN, the crystal structure changes from hexagonal to monoclinic with in-plane lattice distortions on the order of 10^(-4) and the associated splitting of the double degenerate phonon mode of the pristine kagome lattice. Upon further cooling to TCDW, the kagome lattice shows a small negative thermal expansion, and the crystal structure becomes more symmetric gradually upon further cooling. Increasing the crystalline symmetry upon cooling is unusual, it originates from an extremely weak structural instability that coexists and competes with the CDW and magnetic orders. These observations are against the expectations for a simple model with a single order parameter, hence can only be explained by a Landau free energy expansion that takes into account multiple lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom. Thus, the determination of the crystalline lattice symmetry as well as the unusual spin-lattice coupling is a first step towards understanding the rich electronic and magnetic properties of the system and sheds new light on intertwined orders where the lattice degree of freedom is no longer dominant.</description>

      <title>Induced quantum magnetism in CEF singlet ground state models: Thermodynamics and excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative investigation of singlet ground state induced magnetism for singlet, doublet and triplet excited CEF states of non-Kramers f-electrons relevant primarily for Pr- and U- based compounds. This type of magnetic order is of intrinsic quantum nature because it requires the superposition of singlet ground state with excited states due to non-diagonal matrix elements of the effective intersite exchange to generate local moments. In contrast to conventional magnets the local moments and their ordering appear simultaneously at the transition temperature. It is finite only if the control parameter proportional to the ratio of exchange strength to level splitting exceeds a critical value marking the quantum critical point of the models. We determine the dependence of transition temperature, saturation moment, renormalised level splitting, specific heat jumps and low-temperature susceptibility as function of control parameter. Furthermore the temperature dependence of these quantities is calculated for control parameters above and below the quantum critical point and the distinction to conventional magnetism is discussed. In addition we investigate the dynamical properties of the three models, deriving the magnetic exciton dispersion and their critical behaviour. In particular the conditions for true and arrested soft-mode behaviour at the ordering wave vector are identified.</description>

      <title>Time reversal invariant topological 1D and 2D superconductors: doubling the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Oppen proposals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a doubled version of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open proposals thereby obtaining time reversal invariant p-wave superconductivity in both 1D and 2D. This construction is much like the Kane-Mele spin Hall model which is a time reversal invariant doubling of the Haldane model. We show that the low energy effective action for these doubled versions of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open models corresponds to a single band p-wave time reversal invariant superconductors with pseudo spin degree of freedom instead of spin degree of freedom. There are Majorana fermions at the ends of wires or in vortex cores of these superconductors. Furthermore these are shown to be stable to small perturbations. In the supplement we present physical realization of the system with cold atoms and show a related "no-go" theorem given in Haim et. al. (2019) has too restrictive assumptions to apply to this proposal.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Edge Mode in Asymptotically AdS$_2$: JT Gravity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge mode of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and its $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ BF theory description with the asymptotic AdS$_2$ boundary condition. We revisit the derivation of the Schwarzian theory from the wiggling boundary as an action for the gravitational edge mode. We present an alternative description for the gravitational edge mode from the metric fluctuation with the fixed boundary, which is often referred as "would-be gauge mode". We clarify the relation between the wiggling boundary and the would-be gauge mode. We demonstrate a natural top-down derivation of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauging and the path integral measure of the Schwarzian theory. In the $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ BF theory, we incorporate the gravitational edge mode and derive the Schwarzian theory with $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauging. We also discuss the path integral measure from the Haar measure in the Iwasawa decomposition of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Percolation as a confinement order parameter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) were introduced in 1974 by Wilson to study quark confinement. These models have been shown to exhibit (de-)confined phases, yet it remains challenging to define experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we propose percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) to probe confinement of dynamical matter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using electric field basis snapshots accessible to quantum simulators. We apply the POPs to study a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT and find a confining phase up to temperature $T=\infty$ in 2D (critical $T_c$, i.e. finite-$T$ phase transition, in 3D) for any non-zero density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. Further, using quantum Monte Carlo we demonstrate that the POPs reproduce the square lattice Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram at $T=0$ and explore the phase diagram at $T&gt;0$. The correlation length exponent coincides with the one of the 3D Ising universality class and we determine the POP critical exponent characterizing percolation. Our proposed POPs provide a geometric perspective of confinement and are directly accessible to snapshots obtained in quantum simulators, making them suitable as a probe for quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Probing anyonic statistics via Mach-Zehnder interferometry in quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer for digitized quantum computing devices to probe fractional exchange statistics of anyonic excitations that appear in quantum spin liquids. Employing an IonQ quantum computer, we apply this scheme to the toric ladder, a quasi-one-dimensional reduction of the toric code. We observe interference patterns resulting from the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of `magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo for observable measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of logical quantum processors marks the beginning of the early stages of error-corrected quantum computation. As a bridge between the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, these devices and their successors have the potential to revolutionize the solution of classically challenging problems. An important application of quantum computers is to calculate observables of quantum systems. This problem is crucial for solving quantum many-body and optimization problems. However, due to limited error correction capabilities, this new era are still susceptible to noise, thereby necessitating new quantum algorithms with polynomial complexity as well as noisy-resilency. This paper proposes a new noise-resilient and ansatz-free algorithm, called Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo. It utilizes the quantum Zeno effect and Monte Carlo integration for multi-step adiabatic transitions to the target eigenstates. It can efficiently find static as well as dynamic physical properties such as ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's function without the use of variational parameters. This algorithm offers a polynomial computational cost and quantum circuit depth that is significantly lower than the quantum phase estimation.</description>
