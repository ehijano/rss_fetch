      <title>Fair Minimum Representation Clustering via Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data into a set of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g., electoral districts, playlists, TV channels) whose benefit can only be attained by groups when they reach a minimum level of representation (e.g., 50\% to elect their desired candidate). In this paper, we study the k-means and k-medians clustering problems with the additional constraint that each group (e.g., demographic group) must have a minimum level of representation in at least a given number of clusters. We formulate the problem through a mixed-integer optimization framework and present an alternating minimization algorithm, called MiniReL, that directly incorporates the fairness constraints. While incorporating the fairness criteria leads to an NP-Hard assignment problem within the algorithm, we provide computational approaches that make the algorithm practical even for large datasets. Numerical results show that the approach is able to create fairer clusters with practically no increase in the clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for a bang-bang optimal control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a posteriori error estimates for a control-constrained optimal control problem with bang-bang solutions. We consider a solution strategy based on the variational approach, where the control variable is not discretized; no Tikhonov regularization is made. We design, for the proposed scheme, a residual-type a posteriori error estimator that can be decomposed as the sum of two individual contributions related to the discretization of the state and adjoint equations. We explore reliability and efficiency properties of the aforementioned error estimator. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Resilient Two-Time-Scale Local Stochastic Gradient Descent for Byzantine Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local stochastic gradient descent methods for solving federated optimization over a network of agents communicating indirectly through a centralized coordinator. We are interested in the Byzantine setting where there is a subset of $f$ malicious agents that could observe the entire network and send arbitrary values to the coordinator to disrupt the performance of other non-faulty agents. The objective of the non-faulty agents is to collaboratively compute the optimizer of their respective local functions under the presence of Byzantine agents. In this setting, prior works show that the local stochastic gradient descent method can only return an approximate of the desired solutions due to the impacts of Byzantine agents. Whether this method can find an exact solution remains an open question. In this paper, we will address this open question by proposing a new variant of the local stochastic gradient descent method. Under similar conditions that are considered in the existing works, we will show that the proposed method converges exactly to the desired solutions. We will provide theoretical results to characterize the convergence properties of our method, in particular, the proposed method convergences at an optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, where $k$ is the number of iterations. Finally, we will present a number of simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Envisioning an Optimal Network of Space-Based Lasers for Orbital Debris Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in resident space objects, including satellites and orbital debris, threatens the safety and sustainability of space missions. This paper explores orbital debris remediation using laser ablation with a network of collaborative space-based lasers. A novel delta-v vector analysis framework quantifies the effects of multiple simultaneous laser-to-debris (L2D) engagements by leveraging a vector composition of imparted delta-v vectors. The paper introduces the Concurrent Location-Scheduling Problem (CLSP), which optimizes the placement of laser platforms and schedules L2D engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity. Due to the computational complexity of CLSP, it is decomposed into two sequential subproblems: (1) optimal laser platform locations are determined using the Maximal Covering Location Problem, and (2) a novel integer linear programming-based approach schedules L2D engagements within the network configuration to maximize remediation capacity. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework's effectiveness under various mission scenarios, demonstrating key network functions such as collaborative nudging, deorbiting, and just-in-time collision avoidance. A cost-benefit analysis further explores how varying the number and distribution of laser platforms affects debris remediation capacity, providing insights into optimizing the performance of space-based laser networks.</description>

      <title>Predefined-time distributed non-convex optimization via a time-base generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two novel multi-agent systems for the resource allocation problems (RAPs) and consensus-based distributed optimization problems. Different from existing distributed optimal approaches, we propose the new time-base generators (TBGs) for predefined-time non-convex optimization. Leveraging the proposed time-base generator, we study the roughness and boundedness of Lyapunov function based on TBGs. We prove that our approach achieves predefined-time approximate convergence to the optimal solution if the cost functions exhibit non-strongly convex or even non-convex characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that our approaches converge to the optimal solution if cost functions are generalized smoothness, and exhibit faster convergence rate and CPU speed. Finally, we present numerous numerical simulation examples to confirm the effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Inertial Proximal Difference-of-Convex Algorithm with Convergent Bregman Plug-and-Play for Nonconvex Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging tasks are typically addressed using a structured optimization framework. This paper investigates a class of algorithms for difference-of-convex (DC) structured optimization problems, which aim to minimize the sum of a DC function and a possibly nonconvex function. Although various forms of the DC algorithm (DCA) exist, they either struggle to handle a possibly nonconvex function or exhibit slow practical convergence. We propose a novel inertial proximal DC algorithm in Bregman geometry, termed iBPDCA, to tackle a nonconvex term and incorporate inertial techniques to enhance its convergence speed. A thorough theoretical analysis is presented to establish both the subsequential and global convergence of iBPDCA through the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play variant of iBPDCA, named PnP-iBPDCA. The plug-and-play approach replaces conventional handcrafted priors with a deep prior, providing a flexible and robust solution that harnesses neural networks while ensuring theoretical convergence. The adopted Gaussian gradient step denoiser is established to be equivalent to evaluating the Bregman proximal operator of an implicit functional with weak convexity. Our method has been applied to image recovery from Rician noise corruption and phase retrieval, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Global prescribed-time control of a class of uncertain nonholonomic systems by smooth time-varying feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the prescribed-time smooth control problem for a class of uncertain nonholonomic systems. With a novel smooth time-varying state transformation, the uncertain chained nonholonomic system is reformulated as an uncertain linear time-varying system. By fully utilizing the properties of a class of parametric Lyapunov equations and constructing time-varying Lyapunov-like functions, smooth time-varying high-gain state and output feedback controllers are designed. The states and controllers are proven to converge to zero at any prescribed time. The proposed smooth time-varying method combines the advantage of a time-varying high-gain function, which enhances control performance, and a smooth time-varying function that can drive the states to zero at the prescribed time. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>On the mean field limit of consensus based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus based optimization (CBO) employs a swarm of particles evolving as a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Recently, it has been adapted to yield a derivative free sampling method referred to as consensus based sampling (CBS). In this paper, we investigate the ``mean field limit'' of a class of consensus methods, including CBO and CBS. This limit allows to characterize the system's behavior as the number of particles approaches infinity. Building upon prior work such as (Huang and Qiu, 2022), we establish the existence of a unique, strong solution for these finite-particle SDEs. We further provide uniform moment estimates, which allow to show a Fokker-Planck equation in the mean-field limit. Finally, we prove that the limiting McKean-Vlasov type SDE related to the Fokker-Planck equation admits a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear identifiability of directed acyclic graphs with partial excitation and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs in the case of partial excitation and measurement. We consider an additive model where the nonlinear functions located in the edges depend only on a past input, and we analyze the identifiability problem in the class of pure nonlinear functions satisfying $f(0)=0$. We show that any identification pattern (set of measured nodes and set of excited nodes) requires the excitation of sources, measurement of sinks and the excitation or measurement of the other nodes. Then, we show that a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is identifiable with a given identification pattern if and only if it is identifiable with the measurement of all the nodes. Next, we analyze the case of trees where we prove that any identification pattern guarantees the identifiability of the network. Finally, by introducing the notion of a generic nonlinear network matrix, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of DAGs based on the notion of vertex-disjoint paths.</description>

      <title>Solving bilevel problems with products of upper- and lower-level variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel programming problems frequently arise in real-world applications across various fields, including transportation, economics, energy markets and healthcare. These problems have been proven to be NP-hard even in the simplest form with linear upper and lower-level problems. This paper addresses a specific type of bilevel programming problem where the upper-level is linear, and the lower level includes bilinear terms involving product of variables from both levels. We propose a new iterative algorithm that addresses this specific class of bilevel problems by penalizing the duality gap and linearizing the bilinear terms. The effectiveness of the algorithm is argued and demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Better bounds on Grothendieck constants of finite orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grothendieck constants $K_G(d)$ bound the advantage of $d$-dimensional strategies over $1$-dimensional ones in a specific optimisation task. They have applications ranging from approximation algorithms to quantum nonlocality. However, apart from $d=2$, their values are unknown. Here, we exploit a recent Frank-Wolfe approach to provide good candidates for lower bounding some of these constants. The complete proof relies on solving difficult binary quadratic optimisation problems. For $d\in\{3,4,5\}$, we construct specific rectangular instances that we can solve to certify better bounds than those previously known; by monotonicity, our lower bounds improve on the state of the art for $d\leqslant9$. For $d\in\{4,7,8\}$, we exploit elegant structures to build highly symmetric instances achieving even greater bounds; however, we can only solve them heuristically. We also recall the standard relation with violations of Bell inequalities and elaborate on it to interpret generalised Grothendieck constants $K_G(d\mapsto2)$ as the advantage of complex quantum mechanics over real quantum mechanics. Motivated by this connection, we also improve the bounds on $K_G(d\mapsto2)$.</description>

      <title>LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in machine learning, with applications in multi-task learning, learning under fairness or robustness constraints, etc. Instead of reducing multiple objective functions into a scalar objective, MOPs aim to optimize for the so-called Pareto optimality or Pareto set learning, which involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously, over models with millions of parameters. Existing benchmark libraries for MOPs mainly focus on evolutionary algorithms, most of which are zeroth-order methods that do not effectively utilize higher-order information from objectives and cannot scale to large-scale models with millions of parameters. In light of the above gap, this paper introduces LibMOON, the first multiobjective optimization library that supports state-of-the-art gradient-based methods, provides a fair benchmark, and is open-sourced for the community.</description>

      <title>Rigid-Body Attitude Control on $\mathsf{SO(3)}$ using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a cascaded control architecture, based on nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI), for rigid body attitude control. The proposed controller works directly with the rotation matrix parameterization, that is, with elements of the Special Orthogonal Group $\mathsf{SO(3)}$, and avoids problems related to singularities and non-uniqueness which affect other commonly used attitude representations such as Euler angles, unit quaternions, modified Rodrigues parameters, etc. The proposed NDI-based controller is capable of imposing desired linear dynamics of any order for the outer attitude loop and the inner rate loop, and gives control designers the flexibility to choose higher-order dynamic compensators in both loops. In addition, sufficient conditions are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which ensure that the outer loop controller renders the attitude loop almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS) and the rate loop globally asymptotically stable (GAS). Furthermore, the overall cascaded control architecture is shown to be AGAS in the case of attitude error regulation. Lastly, the proposed scheme is compared with an Euler angles-based NDI scheme from literature for a tracking problem involving agile maneuvering of a multicopter in a high-fidelity nonlinear simulation.</description>

      <title>QHDOPT: A Software for Nonlinear Optimization with Quantum Hamiltonian Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an open-source, end-to-end software (named QHDOPT), which can solve nonlinear optimization problems using the quantum Hamiltonian descent (QHD) algorithm. QHDOPT offers an accessible interface and automatically maps tasks to various supported quantum backends (i.e., quantum hardware machines). These features enable users, even those without prior knowledge or experience in quantum computing, to utilize the power of existing quantum devices for nonlinear and nonconvex optimization tasks. In its intermediate compilation layer, QHDOPT employs SimuQ, an efficient interface for Hamiltonian-oriented programming, to facilitate multiple algorithmic specifications and ensure compatible cross-hardware deployment. The detailed documentation of QHDOPT is available at https://github.com/jiaqileng/QHDOPT.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Lyapunov-Based Eclipse-Feasible Low-Thrust Transfer Trajectories to NRHO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating low-thrust transfer trajectories between Earth and the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), that is selected for NASA's Gateway, can be challenging due to the low control authority available from the propulsion system and the important operational constraint that the duration of all eclipses has to be less than a prescribed 90-minute threshold. We present a method for generating eclipse-feasible, minimum-time solutions to the aforementioned trajectory design problem using a Lyapunov control law. Coasting is enforced during solar eclipses due to both the Earth and Moon. We used particle swarm optimization to optimize the NRHO insertion date, time of flight, and control law parameters according to a cost function that prioritizes 1) convergence to the target orbit, 2) satisfaction of eclipse-duration constraints, and 3) minimization of time of flight. Trajectories can serve as initial guesses for NASA's high-fidelity trajectory design tools such as Copernicus and GMAT.</description>

Abstract: The critical length phenomenon of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is well known, however in higher dimensions, it is unknown. This work explores this property in the context of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, a two-dimensional generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Specifically, we demonstrate observability inequalities for this equation, which allow us to deduce the exact boundary controllability and boundary exponential stabilization of the linearized system, provided the spatial domain length avoids certain specific values, which is a direct consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work introduces new results by identifying a set of critical lengths for the two-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

      <title>Robust Q-Learning under Corrupted Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in analyzing the non-asymptotic behavior of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the performance of such algorithms in non-ideal environments, such as in the presence of corrupted rewards, is poorly understood. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the robustness of the celebrated Q-learning algorithm to a strong-contamination attack model, where an adversary can arbitrarily perturb a small fraction of the observed rewards. We start by proving that such an attack can cause the vanilla Q-learning algorithm to incur arbitrarily large errors. We then develop a novel robust synchronous Q-learning algorithm that uses historical reward data to construct robust empirical Bellman operators at each time step. Finally, we prove a finite-time convergence rate for our algorithm that matches known state-of-the-art bounds (in the absence of attacks) up to a small inevitable $O(\varepsilon)$ error term that scales with the adversarial corruption fraction $\varepsilon$. Notably, our results continue to hold even when the true reward distributions have infinite support, provided they admit bounded second moments.</description>

      <title>Grid-Forming Storage Networks: Analytical Characterization of Damping and Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a theoretical study on small-signal stability and damping in bulk power systems with multiple grid-forming inverter-based storage resources. A detailed analysis is presented, characterizing the impacts of inverter droop gains and storage size on the slower eigenvalues, particularly those concerning inter-area oscillation modes. From these parametric sensitivity studies, a set of necessary conditions are derived that the design of droop gain must satisfy to enhance damping performance. The analytical findings are structured into propositions highlighting potential design considerations for improving system stability. The findings are illustrated via numerical studies on an IEEE 68-bus grid-forming storage network.</description>

      <title>The Geometry and Well-Posedness of Sparse Regularized Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the well-posedness of certain sparse regularized linear regression problems, i.e., the existence, uniqueness and continuity of the solution map with respect to the data. We focus on regularization functions that are convex piecewise linear, i.e., whose epigraph is polyhedral. This includes total variation on graphs and polyhedral constraints. We provide a geometric framework for these functions based on their connection to polyhedral sets and apply this to the study of the well-posedness of the corresponding sparse regularized linear regression problem. Particularly, we provide geometric conditions for well-posedness of the regression problem, compare these conditions to those for smooth regularization, and show the computational difficulty of verifying these conditions.</description>

      <title>A New First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithm with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning new tasks by drawing on prior experience gathered from other (related) tasks is a core property of any intelligent system. Gradient-based meta-learning, especially MAML and its variants, has emerged as a viable solution to accomplish this goal. One problem MAML encounters is its computational and memory burdens needed to compute the meta-gradients. We propose a new first-order variant of MAML that we prove converges to a stationary point of the MAML objective, unlike other first-order variants. We also show that the MAML objective does not satisfy the smoothness assumption assumed in previous works; we show instead that its smoothness constant grows with the norm of the meta-gradient, which theoretically suggests the use of normalized or clipped-gradient methods compared to the plain gradient method used in previous works. We validate our theory on a synthetic experiment.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal transport with convex regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to settle the study of non-commutative optimal transport problems with convex regularization, in their static and finite-dimensional formulations. We consider both the balanced and unbalanced problem and show in both cases a duality result, characterizations of minimizers (for the primal) and maximizers (for the dual). An important tool we define is a non-commutative version of the classical $(c,\psi)$-transforms associated with a general convex regularization, which we employ to prove the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations in the balanced case. Finally, we show the convergence of the unbalanced transport problems towards the balanced one, as well as the convergence of transforms, as the marginal penalization parameters go to $+\infty$.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Discrete Event Simulation for Queuing Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Queuing network control is essential for managing congestion in job-processing systems such as service systems, communication networks, and manufacturing processes. Despite growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, queueing network control poses distinct challenges, including high stochasticity, large state and action spaces, and lack of stability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for policy optimization based on differentiable discrete event simulation. Our main insight is that by implementing a well-designed smoothing technique for discrete event dynamics, we can compute pathwise policy gradients for large-scale queueing networks using auto-differentiation software (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch) and GPU parallelization. Through extensive empirical experiments, we observe that our policy gradient estimators are several orders of magnitude more accurate than typical REINFORCE-based estimators. In addition, We propose a new policy architecture, which drastically improves stability while maintaining the flexibility of neural-network policies. In a wide variety of scheduling and admission control tasks, we demonstrate that training control policies with pathwise gradients leads to a 50-1000x improvement in sample efficiency over state-of-the-art RL methods. Unlike prior tailored approaches to queueing, our methods can flexibly handle realistic scenarios, including systems operating in non-stationary environments and those with non-exponential interarrival/service times.</description>

      <title>Unified Convergence Theory of Stochastic and Variance-Reduced Cubic Newton Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic Cubic Newton methods for solving general possibly non-convex minimization problems. We propose a new framework, which we call the helper framework, that provides a unified view of the stochastic and variance-reduced second-order algorithms equipped with global complexity guarantees. It can also be applied to learning with auxiliary information. Our helper framework offers the algorithm designer high flexibility for constructing and analyzing the stochastic Cubic Newton methods, allowing arbitrary size batches, and the use of noisy and possibly biased estimates of the gradients and Hessians, incorporating both the variance reduction and the lazy Hessian updates. We recover the best-known complexities for the stochastic and variance-reduced Cubic Newton, under weak assumptions on the noise. A direct consequence of our theory is the new lazy stochastic second-order method, which significantly improves the arithmetic complexity for large dimension problems. We also establish complexity bounds for the classes of gradient-dominated objectives, that include convex and strongly convex problems. For Auxiliary Learning, we show that using a helper (auxiliary function) can outperform training alone if a given similarity measure is small.</description>

      <title>A hybrid physics-informed neural network based multiscale solver as a partial differential equation constrained optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) and their application in approximating PDEs with two characteristic scales. From a continuous perspective, our formulation corresponds to a non-standard PDE-constrained optimization problem with a PINN-type objective. From a discrete standpoint, the formulation represents a hybrid numerical solver that utilizes both neural networks and finite elements. For the problem analysis, we introduce a proper function space, and we develop a numerical solution algorithm. The latter combines an adjoint-based technique for the efficient gradient computation with automatic differentiation. This new multiscale method is then applied exemplarily to a heat transfer problem with oscillating coefficients. In this context, the neural network approximates a fine-scale problem, and a coarse-scale problem constrains the associated learning process. We demonstrate that incorporating coarse-scale information into the neural network training process via a weak convergence-based regularization term is beneficial. Indeed, while preserving upscaling consistency, this term encourages non-trivial PINN solutions and also acts as a preconditioner for the low-frequency component of the fine-scale PDE, resulting in improved convergence properties of the PINN method.</description>

      <title>A hybrid optimal control problem constrained with hyperelasticity and the global injectivity condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to address a class of hybrid optimal control problems constrained with hyperelasticity and constant global volume. This type of problems can intervene for example in the mechanical aspects of cardiac activity. The time deformation of the heart tissue is modeled with the elastodynamics equations dealing with the displacement field as main unknown. These equations are coupled with a pressure whose time variations are aimed to be maximized. This pressure variable corresponds to a Lagrange multiplier associated with the so-called global injectivity condition, translating the fact that the total volume of the domain remains constant. We develop an optimal control approach in a general framework that covers in particular the maximization of the variations of this pressure, and also the time the maximum is reached, defining what we call a {\it hybrid} optimal control problem. Mathematical analysis based on the $\L^p$-parabolic maximal regularity is provided for the state equations and the rigorous derivation of optimality conditions. Numerical simulations for a toy-model illustrate the capacity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Multistage Constellation Reconfiguration Using Integer Programming and Sequential Decision-Making Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent satellites. In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the advantages of multi-stage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and no-reconfiguration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model mismatch often poses challenges in model-based controller design. This paper investigates model predictive control (MPC) of uncertain linear systems with input constraints, focusing on stability and closed-loop infinite-horizon performance. The uncertainty arises from a parametric mismatch between the true and the estimated system under the matrix Frobenius norm. We examine a simple MPC controller that exclusively uses the estimated system model and establishes sufficient conditions under which the MPC controller can stabilize the true system. Moreover, we derive a theoretical performance bound based on relaxed dynamic programming, elucidating the impact of prediction horizon and modeling errors on the suboptimality gap between the MPC controller and the Oracle infinite-horizon optimal controller with knowledge of the true system. Simulations of a numerical example validate the theoretical results. Our theoretical analysis offers guidelines for obtaining the desired modeling accuracy and choosing a proper prediction horizon to develop certainty-equivalent MPC controllers for uncertain linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide two methods for computation of continuum backstepping kernels that arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs, employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series (in the powers of the ensemble variable). In the second method, we identify a class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be constructed in closed form. We also present numerical examples to illustrate computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based on the continuum.</description>

      <title>Integrated Bundling and Pricing of Unique Items</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retailers have significant potential to improve recommendations through strategic bundling and pricing. By taking into account different types of customers and their purchasing decisions, retailers can better accommodate customer preferences and increase revenues while reducing unsold items. We consider a retailer seeking to maximize its expected revenue by selling unique and non-replenishable items over a finite horizon. The retailer may offer each item individually or as part of a bundle.
  Our approach provides tractable bounds on expected revenue that are tailored to unique items and suitable for a rich class of choice models. We leverage these bounds to propose a bundling algorithm that efficiently selects bundles in a column-generation fashion. Under the multinomial logit model, our bounds are asymptotically optimal as the expected number of arrivals $\lambda$ grows, yielding a performance bound in $O(1/\lambda)$. In contrast, we show that both the static and fluid approximations are not asymptotically optimal. Moreover, we propose a greedy algorithm that allows for tractable dynamic bundling.
  We show through numerical experiments that third-party logistics providers (3PL) in particular can benefit from improved load recommendations and pricing decisions. By not only minimizing shipping costs, but also reducing empty miles and suggesting options that better match carrier preferences, our methodology benefits digital brokerage platforms while contributing to the transportation industry's sustainability efforts. In a Texas Triangle simulation powered by Uber Freight data, dynamic bundling and pricing reduces costs by 6%, empty miles by 25%, and more than halves the number of unmatched loads over dynamic pricing alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid's topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein speed limits for Langevin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems transition between states with finite speed that is limited by energetic costs. In this work, we derive bounds on transition times for general Langevin systems that admit a decomposition into reversible and irreversible dynamics, in terms of the Wasserstein distance between states and the energetic costs associated with respective reversible and irreversible currents. For illustration we discuss Brownian particles subject to arbitrary forcing and an RLC circuit with time-varying inductor.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Frequency Domain Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-parametric frequency-domain system identification from a finite-sample perspective. We assume an open loop scenario where the excitation input is periodic and consider the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE), where the goal is to estimate the frequency response at certain desired (evenly-spaced) frequencies, given input-output samples. We show that under sub-Gaussian colored noise (in time-domain) and stability assumptions, the ETFE estimates are concentrated around the true values. The error rate is of the order of $\mathcal{O}((d_{\mathrm{u}}+\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{u}}d_{\mathrm{y}}})\sqrt{M/N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, where $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total number of samples, $M$ is the number of desired frequencies, and $d_{\mathrm{u}},\,d_{\mathrm{y}}$ are the dimensions of the input and output signals respectively. This rate remains valid for general irrational transfer functions and does not require a finite order state-space representation. By tuning $M$, we obtain a $N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/3}$ finite-sample rate for learning the frequency response over all frequencies in the $ \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. Our result draws upon an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to semi-infinite matrices. We study the finite-sample behavior of ETFE in simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust Clustering on High-Dimensional Data with Stochastic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional vector quantization (clustering) algorithms, particularly K-Means and its variant K-Means++, and explores the Stochastic Quantization (SQ) algorithm as a scalable alternative for high-dimensional unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. Some traditional clustering algorithms suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we trained Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</description>
