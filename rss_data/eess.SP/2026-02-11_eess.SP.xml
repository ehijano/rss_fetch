      <title>E2CAR: An Efficient 2D-CNN Framework for Real-Time EEG Artifact Removal on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently contaminated by artifacts, affecting the accuracy of subsequent analysis. Traditional artifact removal methods are often computationally expensive and inefficient for real-time applications in edge devices. This paper presents a method to reduce the computational cost of most existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) by replacing one-dimensional (1-D) CNNs with two-dimensional (2-D) CNNs and deploys them on Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which is an open-resource hardware accelerator widely used in edge devices for low-latency, low-power operation. A new Efficient 2D-CNN Artifact Removal (E2CAR) framework is also represented using the method above, and it achieves a 90\% reduction in inference time on the TPU and decreases power consumption by 18.98\%, while maintaining comparable artifact removal performance to existing methods. This approach facilitates efficient EEG signal processing on edge devices.</description>

      <title>WiLoc: Massive Measured Dataset of Wi-Fi Channel State Information with Application to Machine-Learning Based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization is a key component of the wireless ecosystem. Machine learning (ML)-based localization using channel state information (CSI) is one of the most popular methods for achieving high-accuracy localization with low cost. However, to be accurate and robust, ML-based algorithms need to be trained and tested with large amounts of data, covering not only many user equipment (UE)/target locations, but also many different access points (APs) locations to which the UEs connect, in a variety of different environment types. This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: &gt; 12 million UE locations, &gt; 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and &gt; 30 streets for outdoor use. The paper describes the dataset structure, measurement environments, measurement protocols, and the dataset validations. Comprehensive case studies validate the advantages of large datasets in ML-driven localization strategies for both "standard" and transfer learning. We envision this dataset, which is by far the largest of its kind, to become a standard resource for researchers in the field of ML-based localization.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Aided Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Blockage-Aware Link in RIS-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of 6G wireless networks. However, practical deployment remains constrained by challenges in accurate channel estimation and control optimization under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a foundation model-aided hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (FM-HDRL) framework designed for joint beamforming and phase-shift optimization in RIS-assisted wireless networks. To implement this, we first fine-tune a pre-trained large wireless model (LWM) to translate raw channel data into low-dimensional, context-aware channel state information (CSI) embeddings. Next, these embeddings are combined with user location information and blockage status to select the optimal communication path. The resulting features are then fed into an HDRL model, assumed to be implemented at a centralized controller, which jointly optimizes the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and the RIS phase-shift configurations to maximize SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FM-HDRL framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, spectral efficiency, and scalability. According to the simulation results, our proposed method improves 7.82% SE compared to the FM-aided deep reinforcement learning (FM-DRL) approach and a substantial enhancement of about 48.66% relative to the beam sweeping approach.</description>

      <title>Digital-Twin-Aided Dynamic Spectrum Sharing and Resource Management in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth in wireless service demand has prompted the evolution of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) to overcome the limitations of traditional terrestrial networks (TNs) in terms of coverage, spectrum efficiency, and deployment cost. Particularly, leveraging LEO satellites and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), ISTNs offer promising solutions but face significant challenges due to diverse terrestrial environments, user and satellite mobility, and long propagation LEO-to-ground distance. To address these challenges, digitial-twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to offer virtual replicas of real-world systems, facilitating prediction for resource management. In this work, we study a time-window-based DT-aided DSS framework for ISTNs, enabling joint long-term and short-term resource decisions to reduce system congestion. Based on that, two optimization problems are formulated, which aim to optimize resource management using DT information and to refine obtained solutions with actual real-time information, respectively. To efficiently solve these problems, we proposed algorithms using compressed-sensing-based and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results using actual traffic data and the London 3D map demonstrate the superiority in terms of congestion minimization of our proposed algorithms compared to benchmarks. Additionally, it shows the adaptation ability and practical feasibility of our proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Cardiorespiratory Signal Processing: Separation, Clustering, and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research applies artificial intelligence (AI) to separate, cluster, and analyze cardiorespiratory sounds. We recorded a new dataset (HLS-CMDS) and developed several AI models, including generative AI methods based on large language models (LLMs) for guided separation, explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret latent representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) for waveform separation, a chemistry-inspired non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for clustering, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to detect abnormal physiological patterns. The performance of these AI models depends on the quality of the recorded signals. Therefore, this thesis also reviews the biosensing technologies used to capture biomedical data. It summarizes developments in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) acoustic sensors and quantum biosensors, such as quantum dots and nitrogen-vacancy centers. It further outlines the transition from electronic integrated circuits (EICs) to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and early progress toward integrated quantum photonics (IQP) for chip-based biosensing. Together, these studies show how AI and next-generation sensors can support more intelligent diagnostic systems for future healthcare.</description>

      <title>When Movable Antennas Meet RSMA and RIS: Robust Beamforming Design With Channel Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an intelligent optimization framework for a multi-user communication system integrating movable antennas (MAs) and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) under the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) protocol. The system sum-rate is maximized through joint optimization of transmit precoding vectors, RIS reflection matrix, common-rate allocation, and MA positions, subject to quality-of-service (QoS), power-budget, common-rate decoding, and mutual coupling constraints. Imperfect channel state information (CSI) is considered for all links, where robustness is ensured by modeling channel estimation errors within a bounded uncertainty region, guaranteeing worst-case performance reliability. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework. The precoding subproblem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via linear matrix inequalities derived using the S-procedure. The RIS reflection matrix is optimized using successive convex approximation (SCA), yielding an equivalent SDP formulation. The MA position optimization is addressed through SCA combined with block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Circular Polarized Transmitter and Receiver Antennas for Mitigation of Mutual Coupling in Monostatic Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through-wall radar systems require compact, wideband and high gain antennas for detecting targets. Building walls introduce considerable attenuation on the radar signals. When the transmitted power is raised to compensate the through-wall attenuation, the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver can saturate the receiver because of which weaker reflections off the target may remain undetected. In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas. The system is tested in through-wall conditions.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Millimeter Wave Radar Waveforms for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation intelligent transportation systems require both sensing and communication between road users. However, deploying separate radars and communication devices involves the allocation of individual frequency bands and hardware platforms. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a robust solution to the challenges of spectral congestion by utilizing a shared waveform, hardware, and spectrum for both localization of mobile users and communication. Various waveforms, including phase-modulated continuous waves (PMCW) and frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW), have been explored for target localization using traditional radar. On the other hand, new protocols such as the IEEE 802.11ad have been proposed to support wideband communication between vehicles. This paper compares both traditional radar and communication candidate waveforms for ISAC to detect single-point and extended targets. We show that the response of FMCW to mobile targets is poorer than that of PMCW. However, the IEEE 802.11ad radar outperforms PMCW radar and FMCW radar. Additionally, the radar signal processing algorithms are implemented on Zynq system-on-chip through hardware-software co-design and fixed-point analysis to evaluate their computational complexity in real-world implementations.</description>

      <title>Motion Compensation for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Inverse Synthetic Aperture Imaging of Automotive Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images generated from single-channel automotive radar data provide critical information about the shape and size of automotive targets. However, the quality of ISAR images degrades due to road clutter and when translational and higher order rotational motions of the targets are not suitably compensated. One method to enhance the signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio (SCNR) of the systems is to leverage the advantages of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) framework available in commercial automotive radars to generate MIMO-ISAR images. While substantial research has been devoted to motion compensation of single-channel ISAR images, the effectiveness of these methods for MIMO-ISAR has not been studied extensively. This paper analyzes the performance of three popular motion compensation techniques - entropy minimization, cross-correlation, and phase gradient autofocus - on MIMO-ISAR. The algorithms are evaluated on the measurement data collected using Texas Instruments millimeter-wave MIMO radar. The results indicate that the cross-correlation MOCOMP performs better than the other two MOCOMP algorithms in the MIMO configuration, with an overall improvement of 36%.</description>

      <title>A Survey on STAR-RIS Enabled Joint Communications and Sensing: Fundamentals, Recent Advances and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint communications and sensing (JCAS) paradigm is envisioned as a core capability of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enabling the integration of data communication and environmental sensing within a unified system. By reusing spectrum, waveforms, and hardware resources, JCAS improves spectral efficiency, reduces system complexity, and hardware cost, while enabling new use cases. Nevertheless, the realization of JCAS is hindered by inherent trade-offs between communication and sensing objectives, limited controllability of wireless propagation, and stringent hardware and design constraints. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) have recently emerged as a promising technology to address these challenges by enabling full-space programmable manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of STAR-RIS-enabled JCAS systems. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental principles of JCAS and STAR-RIS. We then classify and review the state-of-the-art research on STAR-RIS-assisted JCAS from multiple perspectives, encompassing system architectures, waveform and beamforming design, resource allocation, optimization frameworks, and learning-based control. Finally, we identify key open challenges that remain unsolved and outline promising future research directions toward intelligent, flexible, and perceptive 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive and Intelligent Wireless Networks: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems, offering powerful tools to cope with the increasing complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity of modern wireless environments. To illustrate the role and impact of AI in wireless communications, this paper takes collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive and intelligent wireless networks as a representative application and surveys recent advances from an AI perspective. We first introduce the fundamentals of CSS, including the general framework, classical detector design, and fusion strategies. Then, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on AI-driven CSS, classified into three categories: discriminative deep learning (DL) models, generative DL models, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, we explore semantic communication (SemCom) as a promising solution for CSS, in which task-oriented representations are exchanged to reduce reporting overhead while preserving decision-critical information. Finally, we discuss limitations, open challenges, and future research directions at the intersection of AI and wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Generalizable and Robust Beam Prediction for 6G Networks: An Deep-Learning Framework with Positioning Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming (BF) is essential for enhancing system capacity in fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks, yet exhaustive beam training in ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems incurs substantial overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning based framework that leverages position-aware features to improve beam prediction accuracy while reducing training costs. The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available. Simulation results under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional baselines and achieves more accurate and robust beam prediction by effectively incorporating positioning information.</description>

      <title>Rolling Element Bearing Fault Detection and Diagnosis with One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their condition significantly influences system performance, reliability, and operational lifespan. Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Dual Belief-Driven Bayesian-Stackelberg Framework for Low-Complexity and Secure Near-Field ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring robust security in near-field Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems remains a critical challenge due to dynamic channel conditions, multi-eavesdropper threats, and the high computational burden of real-time optimization at mmWave and THz frequencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian-Stackelberg framework that jointly optimizes sensing, beamforming, and communication. The dual-algorithm design integrates (i) Adaptive Hybrid Node Role Switching between secure transmission and cooperative jamming (ii) Belief-Driven Sensing and Beamforming for confidence based resource allocation. The proposed unified framework significantly improves robustness against attacks while preserving linear computational complexity. Simulation results across carrier frequencies ranging from 28 to 410 GHz demonstrate that the method achieves up to a 35% increase in secrecy rates and a success rate exceeding 98%, outperforming conventional communication systems with minimal runtime overhead. These findings underscore the scalability of belief-driven ISAC security solutions for low-complexity deployment in next generation communications.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Normalizing Flow-Based Neyman-Pearson Detector for Covert Communications in the Presence of Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert communications, also known as low probability of detection (LPD) communications, offer a higher level of privacy protection compared to cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS) by hiding the transmission within ambient environments. Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS. Simulations validate the theory and show that the proposed unsupervised MAF-based NP detector achieves performance comparable to its supervised counterpart.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Edge Mismatch and Output Power Degradation in Cascoded Class-D Power Amplifiers Using Dual-Range Voltage Level Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-jitter hybrid voltage level shifter (HVLS) suitable for high-speed applications. The proposed architecture offers the advantage of cross-coupled feedback to simultaneously generate two voltage domain signals with available swings equal to the nominal supply and its double, which operate up to 12.4 GHz. A prototype HVLS circuit, along with impedance matching and a driver to enable high-speed off-chip testing, was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI process technology. The prototype consumes a total die area, including the interface circuitry, of 477 x 462 um^2, while the active area of the level-shifter is 2 x 3.26 um^2. The average power consumption of the circuit is measured to be 4.43 uW per cycle, and the jitter is less than 150 fs-rms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial-style overview article examines the fundamental principles and methods of robustness, using wireless sensing and communication (WSC) as the narrative and exemplifying framework. First, we formalize the conceptual and mathematical foundations of robustness, highlighting the interpretations and relations across robust statistics, optimization, and machine learning. Key techniques, such as robust estimation and testing, distributionally robust optimization, and regularized and adversary training, are investigated. Together, the costs of robustness in system design, for example, the compromised nominal performances and the extra computational burdens, are discussed. Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning. Through this effort, we aim to introduce the classical developments and recent advances in robustness theory to the general signal processing community, exemplifying how robust statistical, optimization, and machine learning approaches can address the uncertainties inherent in WSC systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Analysis of Blind User Identification for Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying Nearest Convex Hull Classification (NCHC) to blind user identification in a massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications system is proposed. The method is blind in the way that the Base Station (BS) only requires a training sequence containing unknown data symbols obtained from the user without further knowledge on the channel, modulation, coding or even noise power. We evaluate the algorithm under the assumption of gaussian transmit signals using the non-rigorous replica method. To facilitate the computations the existence of an Operator Valued Free Fourier Transform is postulated, which is verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The replica computations are conducted in the large but finite system by applying saddle-point integration with inverse temperature $\beta$ as the large parameter. The classifier accuracy is estimated by gaussian approximation through moment-matching.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter is motivated by the need for a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the Doppler effects encountered by electromagnetic and acoustic signals across a diverse spectrum of modern applications. These include land mobile communications, various Internet of Things (IoT) networks, machine-type communications (MTC), and various radar and satellite-based systems for navigation and sensing, as well as the emerging regime of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). A wide array of kinematic profiles is investigated, ranging from uniform motion and constant acceleration to more complex general motion. Consequently, the multi-faceted factors influencing the Doppler shift are addressed in detail, encompassing classical kinematics, special and general relativity, atmospheric dynamics, and the properties of the propagation medium. This work is intended to establish a definitive theoretical foundation for both the general enthusiast and the specialized researcher seeking to master the complexities of signal frequency shifts in modern wireless sensing and communications systems.</description>

      <title>HAPS-RIS and UAV Integrated Networks: A Unified Joint Multi-objective Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G non-terrestrial networks aim to deliver ubiquitous connectivity to remote and undeserved regions, but unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations face fundamental challenges such as limited numbers and power budgets. To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Rank Enhancement With Commodity WiFi Transceivers: Real-World Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a promising enabling technology for the sixth-generation ($6$G) of wireless communications. RISs, thanks to their intelligent design, can reshape the wireless channel to provide favorable propagation conditions for information transfer. In this work, we experimentally investigate the potential of RISs to enhance the effective rank of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, thereby improving spatial multiplexing capabilities. In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains.</description>

      <title>Detecting radar targets swarms in range profiles with a partially complex-valued neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient \emph{mixed near-field and far-field} target localization methods in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems Compared with existing works, we address two new challenges in target localization of MIMO communication systems via using decoupled subspace methods, arising from the half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint and \emph{hybrid uniform planar array} (UPA) architectures.To this end, we propose a new three-step mixed-field localization method. First, we reconstruct the equivalent signals received at UPA antennas by judiciously designing analog combining matrices over time with minimum recovery errors.Second, based on recovered signals, we extend the modified multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to the UPA architectures by constructing a new covariance matrix of a virtual sparse UPA (S-UPA) to decouple the 2D angles and range estimation.Due to the structure of the S-UPA, there exist ambiguous angles when estimating true angles of targets.In the third step, we design an effective classification method to distinguish mixed-field targets, determine true angles of all targets, as well as estimate the ranges of near-field targets.In particular, angular ambiguity is resolved by showing an important fact that the three types of estimated angles (i.e., far-field, near-field, and ambiguous angles) exhibit significantly different patterns in the range-domain MUSIC spectrum.Furthermore, to characterize the estimation error lower-bound, we obtain a matrix closed-form Cram\'er-Rao bounds for mixed-field target localization.Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mixed-field localization method, which improves target-classification accuracy and achieves a lower root mean square error than various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compares the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system across several practical antenna array geometries and SIMO/MISO and MIMO configurations. For identical transmit and receive apertures, MIMO processing is equivalent to squaring the near-field array factor, resulting in improved beamdepth and sidelobe level. Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing improves the maximum near-field sensing range and resolution by approximately a factor of 1.4 compared to a single-aperture system. Using a quadratic approximation of the mainlobe of the array factor, an analytical improvement factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, validating the numerical results. Finally, MIMO is shown to improve the poor sidelobe performance observed in the near-field by a factor of two, due to squaring of the array factor.</description>

      <title>Neural Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a critical bottleneck in modern wireless networks, with pilot overhead consuming 11\% to 21\% of transmission bandwidth and feedback delays causing severe throughput degradation under mobility. Addressing this requires rethinking how neural fields represent coherent wave phenomena. This work introduces \textit{neural Gaussian radio fields (\textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF})}, a physics-informed framework that fundamentally reframes neural field design by replacing view-dependent rasterization with direct complex-valued aggregation in 3D space. This approach natively models wave superposition rather than visual occlusion. The architectural shift transforms the learning objective from function-fitting to source-recovery, a well-posed inverse problem grounded in electromagnetic theory. While demonstrated for wireless channel estimation, the core principle of explicit primitive-based fields with physics-constrained aggregation extends naturally to any coherent wave-based domain, including acoustic propagation, seismic imaging, and ultrasound reconstruction. Evaluations show that the inductive bias of \textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF} achieves 10.9 dB higher prediction SNR than state-of-the-art methods with 220$\times$ faster inference (1.1 ms vs. 242 ms), 18$\times$ lower measurement density, and 180$\times$ faster training. For large-scale outdoor environments where implicit methods fail, \textcolor{stanfordred}{nGRF} achieves 28.32 dB SNR, demonstrating that structured representations supplemented by domain physics can fundamentally outperform generic deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>MARBLE-Net: Learning to Localize in Multipath Environment with Adaptive Rainbow Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand precise and efficient target localization, a task challenged by rich multipath propagation in complex wireless environments. This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the standardization of sixth generation (6G) wireless systems accelerates, there is a growing consensus in favor of evolutionary waveforms that offer new features while maximizing compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which underpins the 4G and 5G systems. This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+).</description>

Abstract: Limited visibility of distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. More representative loads are required to support meaningful analysis of LV substations; otherwise, such analysis risks misinforming future decisions. Traditional load profiling relies on typical profiles, oversimplifying substation-level complexity. Generative models have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, analysis of the co-behaviour between substations is limited, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, Conditional Diffusion models for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level are proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. Multiple models are proposed to handle varying levels of data availability, ranging from unconditional synthesis to an informed generation driven by metadata and daily statistics. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.</description>
