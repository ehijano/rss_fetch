      <title>Multiboundary wormholes and OPE statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive higher moments in the statistical distribution of OPE coefficients in holographic 2D CFTs, and show that such moments correspond to multiboundary Euclidean wormholes in pure 3D gravity. The n-th cyclic non-Gaussian contraction of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients follows from crossing symmetry of the thermal n-point function. We derive universal expressions for the cubic and quartic moments and demonstrate that their scaling with the microcanonical entropy agrees with a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Motivated by this result, we conjecture that the full statistical ensemble of OPE data is fixed by three premises: typicality, crossing symmetry and modular invariance. Together, these properties give predictions for non-factorizing observables, such as the generalized spectral form factor. Using the Virasoro TQFT, we match these connected averages to new on-shell wormhole topologies with multiple boundary components. Lastly, we study and clarify examples where the statistics of heavy operators are not universal and depend on the light operator spectrum. We give a gravitational interpretation to these corrections in terms of Wilson loops winding around non-trivial cycles in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Memory Burden Effect in Black Holes and Solitons: Implications for PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of the \textit{memory burden} effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as \textit{saturons}. The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes (PBHs), that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated, are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge. We identify certain new features of potential observational interest, such as the model-independent spread of the stabilized masses of initially degenerate PBHs.</description>

      <title>'Just another field theory' approach to $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills and the origin of intrinsic SuperGeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>On character expansion and Gaussian regularization of Itzykson-Zuber measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Character expansions are among the most important approaches to modern quantum field theory, which substitute integrals by combinations of peculiar special functions from the Schur-Macdonald family. These formulas allow various deformations, which are not transparent in integral formulation. We analyze from this point of view the Itzykson-Zuber integral over unitary matrices which is exactly solvable, but difficult to deform in $\beta$ and $(q,t)$ directions. Character expansion straightforwardly resolves this problem. However, taking averages with the so defined measure can look problematic, because integrals of individual expansion terms often diverge and well defined is only the sum of them. We explain a way to overcome this problem by Gaussian regularization, which can have a broad range of further applications.</description>

      <title>Proof of 5D $A_n$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a proof of 5D $A_n$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$, where the gauge theory side is one dimension higher than the original 4D case, and corresponds to the q-deformation of the 2D conformal field theory side. We define a q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg integral, which generalizes the $A_n$ Selberg integral and the q-deformed $A_1$ Selberg integral in the literature. A q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg average formula with $n+1$ Schur polynomials is proposed to complete the proof.</description>

      <title>Charged Nariai black holes on the dark bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we realise the charged Nariai black hole on a braneworld from a nucleated bubble in AdS$_5$, known as the dark bubble model. Geometrically, the black hole takes the form of a cylindrical spacetime pulling on the dark bubble. This is realised by a brane embedding in an AdS$_5$ black string background. Identifying the brane with a D3-brane in string theory allows us to determine a relation between the fine structure constant and the string coupling, $\alpha_\text{EM} = \frac{3}{2} g_s$, which was previously obtained for a microscopic black hole. We also speculate on the consequences for the Festina Lente bound and neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>The metamorphosis of semi-classical mechanisms of confinement: From monopoles on ${\mathbb R}^3 \times S^1$ to center-vortices on ${\mathbb R}^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two distinct regimes of Yang-Mills theory where we can demonstrate confinement, the existence of a mass gap, and fractional theta angle dependence using a reliable semi-classical calculation. The two regimes are Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times {\mathbb R}^3$ with a small circle and a double-trace deformation, and Yang-Mills theory on $T^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2$ where the torus $T^2$ is small and threaded by a 't Hooft flux. In the first case the confinement mechanism is related to self-dual monopoles, whereas in the second case self-dual center-vortices play a crucial role. These two topological objects are distinct. In particular, they have different mutual statistics with Wilson loops. On the other hand, they carry the same topological charge and action. We show that one can derive the effective field theory of vortices, a deformed ${\mathbb Z}_N$ TQFT, from the effective theory of the magnetic Coulomb gas in the presence of a 't Hooft flux. We describe this result as a two-stage adjoint Higgs mechanism, where the first stage yields $U(1)^{N-1}$ EFT in 3d and second stage yields a ${\mathbb Z}_N$ EFT in 2d and 1d. This basic mechanism is flux fractionalization: The magnetic flux of the monopoles fractionalizes and collimates in such a way that 2d Wilson loops detect it as a center vortex.</description>

      <title>Symmetric vs. chiral approaches to massive fields with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive higher spin fields are notoriously difficult to introduce interactions when they are described by symmetric (spin)-tensors. An alternative approach is to use chiral description that does not have unphysical longitudinal modes. For low spin fields we show that chiral and symmetric approaches can be related via a family of invertible change of variables (equivalent to parent actions), which should facilitate introduction of consistent interactions in the symmetric approach and help to control parity in the chiral one. We consider some examples of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions and their transmutations when going to the chiral formulation. An interesting feature of the relation is how second class constraints get eliminated while preserving Lorentz invariance.</description>

      <title>Spinning binary dynamics in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the binary dynamics of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary spin vectors in the presence of parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of gravity. We first derive the tree-level Compton amplitudes for a Kerr black hole in cubic gravity, which we then use to compute the two-to-two amplitudes of the massive bodies to leading order in the deformation and the post-Minkowskian expansion. The required one-loop computations are performed using the leading singularity approach as well as the heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT) approach. These amplitudes are then used to compute the leading-order momentum and spin kick in cubic gravity in the KMOC formalism. Our results are valid for generic masses and spin vectors, and include all the independent parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We also present spin-expanded expressions for the momentum and spin kicks, and the all-order in spin deflection angle in the case of aligned spins.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <title>Form factors, spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation in nonlocal quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the conical region of convergence of exponential and asymptotically polynomial form factors and their integral representation as the sum of complex conjugate pairs corresponding to virtual particles that never go on-shell. Then, we calculate the spectral representation of the propagator of nonlocal theories with entire form factors, in particular, of the above type. The spectral density is positive definite and exhibits the same spectrum as the local theory. We also find that the piece of the propagator corresponding to the time-ordered two-point correlation function admits a generalization of the K\"all\'en--Lehmann representation with a standard momentum dependence and a spectral density differing from the local one only in the presence of interactions. These results are in agreement with what already known about the free theory after a field redefinition and about perturbative unitarity of the interacting theory.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the polarization tensor in space-time of three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the convergence properties of the polarization tensor of graphene obtained in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in three-dimensional space-time. During the last years, this problem attracted much attention in connection with calculation of the Casimir force in graphene systems and investigation of the electrical conductivity and reflectance of graphene sheets. There are contradictory statements in the literature, especially on whether this tensor has an ultraviolet divergence in three dimensions. Here, we analyze this problem using the well known method of dimensional regularization. It is shown that the thermal correction to the polarization tensor is finite at any $D$, whereas its zero-temperature part behaves differently for $D=3$ and 4. For $D=3$, it is obtained by the analytic continuation with no subtracting infinitely large terms. As to the space-time of $D=4$, the finite result for the polarization tensor at zero temperature is found after subtracting the pole term. Our results are in agreement with previous calculations of the polarization tensor at both zero and nonzero temperature. This opens possibility for a wider application of the quantum field theoretical approach in investigations of graphene and other two-dimensional novel materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild metric from Scattering Amplitudes to all orders in $G_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a formulation of Einstein's general relativity with only cubic interactions for deriving the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole to all orders in perturbation theory. This cubic interactions formulation coupled to effective worldline action of a massive point particle allows to derive a recursion relation for the form factors of the off-shell graviton emission current. The unique solution to the recursion relation leads to the Schwarzschild black-hole solution in four dimensions. This provides the first derivation of the black hole metric from a matter source to all orders in perturbation theory from an amplitude approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the giant gravitons in the $AdS_4$ bagpipe geometries involving end-of-the-world (ETW) brane constructed by a single $5$-brane and either two stacks or one stack of D3-branes in Type IIB string theory. From the exact formulae and giant graviton expansions of the half-indices for the half-BPS boundary conditions and interfaces in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, we obtain the BPS spectra of the fluctuation modes of the $AdS_4$ bagpipe geometries including the ETW brane region.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group Analysis of $O(3)$ Nonlinear Sigma Model and Non-Abelian Bosonization Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is dual to the free fermion theory in two dimensions via non-Abelian bosonization. Additionally, the $SU(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model is believed to be equivalent to the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term. In this work, we reexamine this duality through the lens of renormalization group (RG) flow. We analyze the RG flow structure of the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term in two dimensions using the functional renormalization group. Our results reveal a nontrivial fixed point with a nonzero value of the topological coupling. The scaling dimensions (critical exponents) at this fixed point suggest the realization of duality between the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with the theta term and the free fermion theory, indicating that these models belong to the same universality class.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density for interacting real and complex scalar fields in a Lorentz symmetry violation scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the vacuum energy density and generation of topological mass are investigated for a system of a real and complex scalar fields interacting with each other. In addition to that, it is also included the quartic self-interaction for each one of the fields. The condition imposed on the real field is the periodic condition, while the complex field obey a quasi-periodic condition. The system is placed in a scenario where the CPT-even aether-type Lorentz symmetry violation takes place. We allow that the Lorentz violation affects the fields with different intensities. The vacuum energy density, its loop correction, and the topological mass are evaluated analytically. It is also discussed the possibility of different vacuum states and their corresponding stability requirements, which depends on the conditions imposed on the fields, the interaction coupling constants and also the Lorentz violation parameters. The formalism used here to perform this investigation is the effective potential one, which is written as a loop expansion via path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>The Channel Capacity of a Relativistic String</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore the limitations on the capacity of a relativistic channel to transmit power and information that arise because of the finiteness of the transverse speed of light. As a model system, I consider a rope constructed from a fundamental string, for which relativistic invariance is built in. By wiggling one end of the string, both power and information may be transmitted to the other end. I argue that even though an unbounded amount of power and information may be traveling down the string, there is a bound on how much may be transmitted. Further, I conjecture that the two kinds of channel capacity -- power and information -- interfere with each other, so that the only way to transmit the maximum amount of power is to send no information, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. We comment on higher dimensional cases for which we argue that in generic situations the replica wormhole configuration is off-shell due to the Witten-Yau theorem. This necessitates the inclusion of smooth constrained saddles into the gravitational path integral for appropriate questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of a relativistic ideal within the context of $\kappa$-deformed space-time and Rainbow gravity background. To achieve this, we construct a modified partition function by considering a deformed Hamiltonian and incorporating corrections based on the time-invariant phase-space volume. We explore the implications of our model on the modified black body radiation spectrum and the modified Debye theory of specific heat in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and Rainbow gravity background.</description>

      <title>Atom falling into a quantum corrected charged black hole and HBAR entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier analysis \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.085007}{Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 085007}, we have explored the event of acceleration radiation for an atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We want to explore the acceleration-radiation when the atom is freely falling into the event horizon of a charged quantum corrected black hole. We consider quantum effects of the electromagnetic field along with the gravitational field in asymptotic safety regime. Introducing the quantum improved Reisner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, we have calculated the excitation probability of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of quantum improved charged black hole. Recently, in case of the braneworld black hole (where the tidal charge has the same dimension as the square of the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in natural units), we have observed from the form of the transition probability that the temperature will have no contribution in the first order of the tidal charge. We observe that for a quantum corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, there is a second order contribution in the charge parameter in the temperature that can be read off from the transition probability. Next, we calculate the HBAR entropy in this thought experiment and show that this entropy has a leading order Bekenstein-Hawking entropy term along with some higher order correction terms involving logarithmic as well as fractional terms of the black hole area due to infalling photons. We have finally investigated the validity of the Wien's displacement law and compared the critical value of the field wavelength with the general Schwarzschild black hole and its corresponding quantum corrected case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore exact generalized symmetries in the standard 2+1d lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to the Ising model, and compare them with their continuum field theory counterparts. One model has a (non-anomalous) non-invertible symmetry, and we identify two distinct non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases. The non-invertible algebra involves a lattice condensation operator, which creates a toric code ground state from a product state. Another model has a mixed anomaly between a 1-form symmetry and an ordinary symmetry. This anomaly enforces a nontrivial transition in the phase diagram, consistent with the "Higgs=SPT" proposal. Finally, we discuss how the symmetries and anomalies in these two models are related by gauging, which is a 2+1d version of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study new classes of metric transformations in the context of scalar-tensor theories, which involve both higher derivatives of the scalar field and derivatives of the metric itself. In general, such transformations are not invertible as they involve derivatives of the metric, which typically leads to instability due to Ostrogradsky ghosts. We show, however, that a certain class of this type of transformations is invertible: we construct new examples of invertible conformal (and also disformal) transformations with higher derivatives. Finally, we make use of these new transformations to construct extended mimetic theories of gravity, and we study their properties in the context of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects and Confinement in the Theory of Nonabelian Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis is devoted to the problem of colour confinement in the non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory (gluon part of Quantum Chromodynamics). A generalisation of the 3-dimensional Fock-Schwinger gauge is proposed where the Gauss law constraint is exactly solvable. This simplifies the theory in a finite domain and incorporates the variables at the boundary into the Hamiltonian formalism. The dependence of the partition function on the boundary value of the longitudinal component of the electric field is studied and related to the mechanism of the confinement-deconfinement transition. The free energy density is calculated for $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gluodynamics in the mean-field approximation for the collective variables. Analysis of its minima reveals a phase transition at a certain temperature, below which the mean collective variables have nonzero values. This can be interpreted as a confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confinement phase the chromo-electric flux through any element of the boundary is strictly zero. This means the singletness with respect to the group of the residual gauge transformations and hence impossibility of observing coloured objects at spatial infinity (in asymptotic states). It is demonstrated that our confinement condition satisfies the traditional confinement criteria. The Wilson loop for $SU(N)$ theory is shown to satisfy the area law. The ratio of the transition temperature to the square root of the string tension coefficient is in a qualitative agreement with the result from lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In the deconfinement phase the global symmetry $Z_{N}$ (centre of $SU(N)$) is spontaneously broken by the surface terms. The confinement phase is characterised by unbroken symmetry with all nontrivial minima having the same depth and transformable by $Z_{N}$ actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise interpretation of the Universe wave function is forbidden in the spirit of the Copenhagen School since a precise notion of measure operation cannot be satisfactorily defined. Here we propose a Bohmian interpretation of the isotropic Universe quantum dynamics, in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is restated by including quantum corrections, which lead to a classical trajectory containing effects of order $\hbar^2$. This solution is then used to determine the spectrum of gauge-invariant quantum fluctuations living on the obtained background model. The analysis is performed adopting the wave function approach to describe the fluctuation dynamics, which gives a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for each Fourier mode and whose frequency is affected by the $\hbar^2$ corrections. The properties of the emerging spectrum are discussed, outlining the modification induced with respect to the scale-invariant result and the hierarchy of the spectral index running is discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we re-analyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum (FPS) data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters which we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a $2\%$ measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.841\pm 0.017$, or equivalently,the structure growth parameter $S_8 = 0.852\pm 0.017$, consistent with the standard cosmology. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;$ 0.08 eV (at 95\% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the spacetime describing the formation and evaporation of a regular black hole in 2D dilaton gravity. The apparent horizons evaporate smoothly in finite time to form a compact trapped region. The spacetime is asymptotically flat at future null infinity and is free of singularities and global horizons. We nevertheless see rich dynamics; an anti-trapped region forms alongside the black hole, and additional compact trapped/anti-trapped regions are formed by backreaction effects as the mass radiates away. These results suggest that the evaporation of regular 2D black holes is unitary.</description>

      <title>How Viable Is a QCD Axion near 10 MeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been an attempt to revive the visible QCD axion at the 10 MeV scale assuming that it exclusively couples to the first-generation quarks and the electron. This variant of the QCD axion is claimed to remain phenomenologically viable, partly due to a clever model construction that induces tree-level pion-phobia and exploits uncertainties inherent in the chiral perturbation theory. We confront this model with the cosmological domain wall problem, the quality issue and constraints arising from the electron electric dipole moment. It is also pointed out that the gluon loop-generated axion-top coupling can provide a very large contribution to rare $B$-meson decays, such that the present LHCb data for $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ rule out the model for the axion mass larger than 30 MeV. There is a strong motivation for pushing the experimental analysis of $B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-$ to a lower $e^+ e^-$ invariant mass window, which will conclusively determine the fate of the model, as its contribution to this branching ratio significantly exceeds the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Non-perturbative Regime of the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator by Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of deep learning in physical sciences has recently boosted the ability of researchers to tackle physical systems where little or no analytical insight is available. Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Discrete Orbit Effect Lengthens Merger Times for Inspiraling Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspiral merger time for two black holes captured into a nonrelativistic bound orbit by gravitational radiation emission has been often calculated by a formula of Peters that assumes the adiabatic approximation that the changes per orbit are small. However, initially this is not true for the semimajor axis and period of most of the initially highly eccentric orbits, which change significantly during closest approach and much less elsewhere along the orbit. This effect can make the merger time much longer (using other formulas from Peters that do not assume the adiabatic approximation) than that calculated by the adiabatic formula of Peters.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar clouds and black hole spacetimes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study static black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with a massive scalar field as an example of higher curvature gravity. The scalar mass introduces an additional scale and leads to a strong suppression of the scalar field beyond its Compton wavelength. We numerically compute sGB black hole spacetimes and scalar configurations and also compare with perturbative results for small couplings, where we focus on a dilatonic coupling function. We analyze the constraints on the parameters from requiring the curvature singularity to be located inside the black hole horizon $r_h$ and the relation to the regularity condition for the scalar field. For scalar field masses $m r_h \gtrsim 10^{-1}$, this leads to a new and currently most stringent bound on sGB coupling constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha/r_h^2 \sim 10^{-1}$ in the context of stellar mass black holes. Lastly, we look at several properties of the black hole configurations relevant for further work on observational consequences, including the scalar monopole charge, Arnowitt Deser Misner mass, curvature invariants and the frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamics of a charged spinning body in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin supplementary condition for the electromagnetic interactions which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follows from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>

      <title>Natural Inflation with Exponentially Small Tensor-To-Scalar Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that "natural inflation", also known as "axion inflation", can be compatible with Planck 2018 measurements of the cosmic microwave background, while predicting an exponentially small tensor-to-scalar ratio, e.g., $r\sim 10^{-15}$. The strong suppression of $r$ arises from dynamics of the radial component of the complex scalar field, whose phase is the axion. Such tiny values of $r$ remain well below the threshold for detection by CMB-S4 or Simons Observatory B-mode searches. The model is testable with the running $\alpha_s$ of the spectral index, which is within reach of next-generation CMB and large-scale structure experiments, motivating the running as a primary science goal for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation versus Information Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is the phenomenon in which locally inaccessible energy is activated as extractable work through collaborative local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with an entangled partner. It closely resembles the more well-known quantum information teleportation (QIT) where quantum information can be sent through an entangled pair with LOCC. It is tempting to ask how QET is related to QIT. Here we report a first study of this connection. Despite the apparent similarity, we show that these two phenomena are not only distinct but moreover are mutually exclusive to each other. We show a perturbative trade-off relation between their performance in a thermal entangled chaotic many-body system, in which both QET and QIT are simultaneously implemented through a traversable wormhole in an emergent spacetime. To better understand their competition, we study the finite-dimensional counterpart of two entangled qudits and prove a universal non-perturbative trade-off bound. It shows that for any teleportation scheme, the overall performance of QET and QIT together is constrained by the amount of the entanglement resource. We discuss some explanations of our results.</description>

      <title>Pion gravitational form factors in the QCD instanton vacuum I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pion form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor (EMT) are studied in the instanton liquid model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum. In this approach the breaking of conformal symmetry is encoded in the form of stronger-than-Poisson fluctuations in the number of instantons. For the trace of the EMT, it is shown that the gluonic trace anomaly term contributes half the pion mass, with the other half coming from the quark-mass-dependent sigma term. The $Q^2$ dependence of the form factors is governed by glueball and scalar meson exchanges. For the traceless EMT, the spin-0 and 2 form factors are computed at next-to-leading order in the instanton density using effective quark operators. Relations between the gluon and quark contributions to the EMT form factors are derived. The form factors are also expressed in terms of the pion light-front wave functions in the ILM. The results at the low resolution scale of the inverse instanton size are evolved to higher scales using the renormalization group equation. The ILM results compare well with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Topological Spherical T-duality -- Dimension change from higher degree $H$-flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Spherical T-duality was introduced by Bouwknegt, Evslin and Mathai in [BEM15] as an extension of topological T-duality from $S^1$ bundles to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-bundles endowed with closed 7-forms. This notion was further extended to sphere bundles by Lind, Sati and Westerland [LSW16] as a duality between $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed $(4n-1)$-forms. We generalise this relation one step further and define T-duality for $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed odd forms of arbitrary degree. The degree of the form determines the dimension of the fibers of the dual spaces. We show that $T$-duals exist and, as in the previous cases, $T$-dual spaces have isomorphic twisted cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum -- we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough -- but it is a significant step in that direction.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom in modified Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the issue of degrees of freedom in modified teleparallel gravity. These theories do have an extra structure on top of the usual (pseudo)Riemannian manifold, that of a flat parallel transport. This structure is absolutely abstract and unpredictable (pure gauge) in GR-equivalent models, however it becomes physical upon modifications. The problem is that, in the most popular models, this local symmetry is broken but not stably so, hence the infamous strong coupling issues. The Hamiltonian analyses become complicated and with contradictory results. A funny point is that what we see in available linear perturbation treatments of $f(T)$ gravity is much closer to the analysis with less dynamical degrees of freedom which has got a well-known mistake in it, while the more accurate work predicts much more of dynamics than what has ever been seen up to now. I discuss possible reasons behind this puzzle, and also argue in favour of studying the most general New GR models which are commonly ignored due to suspicion of ghosts.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Landau Levels and Implication for non-Abelian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a fundamental concept to characterize the local properties of quantum states. It is recently demonstrated that saturating certain quantum geometric bounds allows a topological Chern band to share many essential features with the lowest Landau level, facilitating fractionalized phases in moir\'e flat bands. In this work, we systematically extend the consequence and universality of saturated geometric bounds to arbitrary Landau levels by introducing a set of single-particle states, which we term as ``generalized Landau levels''. These generalized Landau levels exhibit exactly quantized values of integrated trace of quantum metric determined by their corresponding Landau level indices, regardless of the nonuniformity of their quantum geometric quantities. We derive all geometric quantities for individual and multiple generalized Landau levels, discuss their relations, and understand them in light of the theory of holomorphic curves and moving frames. We further propose a model by superposing few generalized Landau levels which is supposed to capture a large portion of the single-particle Hilbert space of a generic Chern band analogous to the first Landau level. Using this model, we employ exact diagonalization to identify a single-particle geometric criterion for permitting the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase, which is potentially useful for future engineering of moir\'e materials and beyond. We use a double twisted bilayer graphene model with only adjacent layer hopping term to show the existence of first generalized Landau level type narrow band and zero-field Moore-Read state at the second magic angle which serves as a promising starting point for more detailed future studies. We expect that generalized Landau levels will serve as a systematic tool for analyzing topological Chern bands and fractionalized phases therein.</description>

Abstract: Parametric integration with hyperlogarithms so far has been successfully used in problems of high energy physics (HEP) and critical statics. In this work, for the first time, it is applied to a problem of critical dynamics, namely, a stochastic model of developed turbulence in high-dimensional spaces, which has a propagator that is non-standard with respect to the HEP: $(-i \omega + \nu k^2)^{-1}$. Adaptation of the hyperlogarithm method is carried out by choosing a proper renormalization scheme and considering an effective dimension of the space. Analytical calculation of the renormalization group functions is performed up to the fourth order of the perturbation theory, $\varepsilon$-expansion of the critical exponent $\omega$ responsible for the infrared stability of the fixed point is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the package Blade as the first implementation of the block-triangular form improved Feynman integral reduction method. The block-triangular form has orders of magnitude fewer equations compared to the plain integration-by-parts system, allowing for strictly block-by-block solutions. This results in faster evaluations and reduced resource consumption. We elucidate the algorithms involved in obtaining the block-triangular form along with their implementations. Additionally, we introduce novel algorithms for finding the canonical form and symmetry relations of Feynman integrals, as well as for performing spanning-sector reduction. Our benchmarks for various state-of-the-art problems demonstrate that Blade is remarkably competitive among existing reduction tools. Furthermore, the Blade package offers several distinctive features, including support for complex kinematic variables or masses, user-defined Feynman prescriptions for each propagator, and general integrands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a scalar field together with a vector field minimally coupled to gravity. By assuming an effective potential that incorporates both fields into the action, we explore two distinct scenarios: one where the fields interact and another where they do not. In this context, we find different analytical solutions to the background scalar-vector fields dynamics during the inflationary scenario considering the slow-roll approximation. Besides, general conditions required for these models of two fields to be realizable are determined and discussed. From the cosmological perturbations, we consider a local field rotation, and then we determine these perturbations (scalar and tensor) during inflation, and we also utilize recent cosmological observations for constraining the parameter-space in these scalar-vector inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal, and thermoelectric magnetoconductivity for Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups induced by the combined effects of topology and strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations where a three-dimensional Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $, generalizing the considerations of Phys. Rev. B 108 (2023) 155132 and Physica E 159 (2024) 115914. The electromagnetic fields are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other, thus leading to the possibility of having a collinear component, which does not arise in a Hall set-up. The net effective magnetic field $\mathbf B_\chi $ consists of two parts - (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $ applied externally; and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the generic expressions for the response tensors, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bandstructures. We elucidate the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the longitudinal and transverse (or Hall) components of the electric, thermal, and thermoelectric response tensors. Especially, for the planar transverse components of the response tensors, the OMM part acts exclusively in opposition (sync) with the BC-only part for the Weyl (multi-Weyl) semimetals.</description>

      <title>Is Yang-Mills Theory Unitary in Fractional Spacetime Dimensions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present concrete evidence that Yang-Mills theory exhibits non-unitarity in non-integer spacetime dimensions. This violation of unitarity stems from evanescent operators that, while vanishing in four dimensions, are non-zero in general d dimensions. We demonstrate that these evanescent operators lead to the emergence of both negative-norm states and complex anomalous dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the running and the UV limit of Wilsonian renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman type field correlators. Such a flow is a parametric family of ultraviolet (UV) regularized field correlators, the parameter being the strength of the UV regularization, and the instances with different strength of UV regularizations are linked by the renormalization group equation (RGE). Important RG flows are those which reach out to any UV regularization strengths. In this paper it is shown that for these flows a natural, mathematically rigorous generally covariant definition can be given, and that they form a topological vector space which is Hausdorff, locally convex, complete, nuclear, semi-Montel, Schwartz. That is, they form a generalized function space having favorable properties, similar to multivariate distributions. The other theorem proved in the paper is that for Wilsonian RG flows reaching out to all UV regularization strengths, a simple factorization formula holds in case of bosonic fields over flat (affine) spacetime: the flow always originates from a regularization-independent distributional correlator, and its running satisfies an algebraic ansatz. The conjecture is that this factorization theorem should generically hold, which is worth future investigations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study a model in nonlinear electrodynamics in the presence of a CPT-even term that violates Lorentz symmetry. The Lorentz-breaking vector, in addition to the usual background magnetic field, produces interesting effects in the dispersion relations. The consequences on the vacuum refractive index and the group velocity are studied. Vacuum birefringence is discussed in the case the nonlinear electrodynamics is a Euler-Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loop Duality and OPE for Super Form Factors of Half-BPS Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dual Wilson loop description for the MHV super form factors of half-BPS operators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In this description, the local operators are represented by on-shell states, made out of zero-momentum particles, that are absorbed by a null periodic super Wilson loop. We present evidence for this duality at weak coupling, by performing an explicit calculation of the Wilson loop matrix elements through one loop. At tree level, the interactions localize at the cusps of the loop, revealing a simple connection between the super form factors and the $m=2$ tree amplituhedron. At loop level, we show that the Wilson loop calculation reproduces the known results for the super form factors. Inspired by this duality, we extend the OPE program developed for the form factors of the Lagrangian to the super form factors of the higher-charge operators. We introduce non-perturbative axioms and conjectures for the main building blocks that govern the exchange of the lightest flux-tube excitations. These blocks appear as simple refinements of the form factor transitions introduced in earlier OPE studies. They are expressed at any value of the 't Hooft coupling in terms of the tilted Beisert-Eden-Staudacher kernel. We carry out checks of our conjectures up to two loops at weak coupling for three- and four-point form factors of half-BPS operators of various lengths, finding perfect agreement with perturbative data.</description>

      <title>What exactly does Bekenstein bound?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.</description>

Abstract: We study 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ theories derived from compactifying class $\mathcal{S}$ theories on $S^2$ with a topological twist. We present concise expressions for the elliptic genera of both classes of theories, revealing the TQFT structure on Riemann surfaces $C_{g,n}$. Furthermore, our study highlights the relationship between the left-moving sector of the (0,2) theory and the chiral algebra of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory. Notably, we propose that the (0,2) elliptic genus of a theory of this class can be expressed as a linear combination of characters of the corresponding chiral algebra.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the quantum algebraic formalism of the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$, where D2/D4/D6/D8-branes are present. We demonstrate that the contour integral formulas have free field interpretations, leading to the operator formalism of $qq$-characters associated with each D-brane. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence.
  Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations, $q$-characters, and the Bethe ansatz equations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$. This connection provides insights into the Bethe/Gauge correspondence of the gauge origami system from both gauge-theoretic and quantum-algebraic perspectives.
  We finally present conjectures regarding generalizations to general toric Calabi-Yau four-folds. These generalizations imply the existence of an extensive class of $qq$-characters, which we call BPS $qq$-characters. These BPS $qq$-characters offer a new systematic approach to derive a broader range of BPS/CFT correspondence and Bethe/Gauge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Non-Chiral Vertex Operator Algebra Associated To Lorentzian Lattices And Narain CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman constructed a vertex operator algebra (VOA) associated to any even, integral, Euclidean lattice. In the language of physics, these are examples of chiral conformal field theories (CFT). In this paper, we define non-chiral vertex operator algebra and some associated notions. We then give a construction of a non-chiral VOA associated to an even, integral, Lorentzian lattice and construct their irreducible modules. We obtain the moduli space of such modular invariant non-chiral CFTs based on even, self-dual Lorentzian lattices of signature $(m,n)$ assuming the validity of a technical result about automorphisms of the lattice. We finally show that Narain conformal field theories in physics are examples of non-chiral VOA. Our formalism helps us to identify the chiral algebra of Narain CFTs in terms of a particular sublattice and give us the decomposition of its partition function into sum of characters.</description>

      <title>Thin-Wall Monopoles in a False Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically the existence in a false vacuum, of magnetic monopoles which are ``thin-walled'', \ie, which correspond to a spherical region of radius $R$ that is essentially trivial surrounded by a wall of thickness $\Delta\ll R$, hence the name thin wall, and finally an exterior region that essentially corresponds to a pure Abelian magnetic monopole. Such monopoles were dubbed false monopoles and can occur in non-abelian gauge theories where the symmetry-broken vacuum is actually the false vacuum. This idea was first proposed in \cite{Kumar:2010mv}, however, {the proof of the existence of thin-wall, false monopoles given there }was incorrect. Here we fill this lacuna and demonstrate numerically{, for an appropriately modifed potential,} the existence of thin-wall false monopoles. The decay via quantum tunnelling of the false monopoles could be of importance to cosmological scenarios which entertain epochs in which the universe is trapped in a symmetry broken false vacuum.</description>

Abstract: Born's original 1933 theory of nonlinear electrodynamics (in contrast to the later Born-Infeld theory) is acausal for strong fields. We explore the issue of strong-field causality violation in families of theories containing Born and/or Born-Infeld, and many variants that have been previously proposed in contexts that include cosmology and black hole physics. Many of these variants are acausal and hence unphysical. A notable exception is the modified Born-Infeld theory with ModMax as its conformal weak-field limit.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation, using the algorithm in closed system and open system. Our analysis could be applied to the most inflationary models. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster growth after the horizon exists. Since the whole universe is an open system, the approach of an open system is more realistic and reliable. Then, we construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the quantum level to the classical level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental heterotic string has a tower of BPS states whose supersymmetric index has an exponential growth in the charges. We construct the saddle-point of the gravitational path integral corresponding to this index. The saddle-point configuration is a supersymmetric rotating non-extremal Euclidean black hole. This configuration is singular in the two-derivative theory. We show that the addition of higher-derivative terms in four-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity resolves the singularity. In doing so, we extend the recently-developed "new attractor mechanism" to include the effect of higher-derivative terms. Remarkably, the one-loop, four-derivative F-term contribution to the prepotential leads to a precise match of the gravitational and microscopic index. We also comment, using the effective theory near the horizon, on the possibility of a string-size near-extremal black hole. Our results clarify the meaning of different descriptions of this system in the literature. The thermal state transitions to a winding condensate and a gas of strings without ever reaching a small black hole, while the index is captured by the rotating Euclidean black hole solution and is constant and thus smoothly connected to the microscopic ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the frequency-domain LO and NLO post-Minkowskian (PM) waveforms obtained from the tree-level and one-loop amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive scalar objects and the emission of one graviton. We explicitly calculate their post-Newtonian (PN) limit obtaining an expansion up to the third subleading PN order in all ingredients: the tree-level amplitude, the odd and even parts of the real one-loop kernel, and the Compton or "rescattering" cuts, thus reaching 3PN precision for the latter. We provide explicit expressions for the multipole decomposition of these results in the center-of-mass frame and compare them with the results obtained from the classical Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPM) method. We find perfect agreement between the two, once the BMS supertranslation frame is properly adjusted and the infrared divergences due to rescattering are suitably subtracted in dimensional regularization. This shows that the approach proposed in arXiv:2312.07452 can be applied beyond the soft-regime ensuring the agreement between amplitude-based and MPM results for generic frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

Abstract: Considering the nonminimal coupling of the dilaton field to the massive graviton field in Maxwell-dilaton-massive gravity, we obtain a class of analytical solutions of charged black holes, which are neither asymptotically flat nor (A)dS. The calculated thermodynamic quantities, such as mass, temperature and entropy, verify the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we further investigate the critical behaviors of these black holes in the grand canonical and canonical ensemble, and find a novel critical phenomenon never before observed, known as the ``reverse" reentrant phase transition with a tricritical point. It implies that the system undergoes a novel ``SBH-LBH-SBH" phase transition process, and is the reverse of the ``LBH-SBH-LBH" process observed in reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Modifications of Charged Casimir Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the investigation of the consequences of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir effect within the context of a traversable wormhole, recently proposed by Garattini \&amp; Faizal, arXiv:2403.15174 [gr-qc], subject to charge contributions. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where the plates exhibit both constant and radial variations. In our analysis, we initially concentrate on the high temperature approximation, considering solely the influence of charge on the thermal Casimir wormholes. Additionally, upon incorporating Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) corrections to the Casimir energy, we obtain a new class of wormhole solutions. Notably, we establish that the flare-out condition remains consistently satisfied. Intriguingly, our findings reveal that both the charge and GUP contributions serve to further enlarge the throat's size in the radial variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide holographic realisations in Minkowski spacetime of a free conformal Carrollian scalar field living at null infinity. To this end, we first show that the electric and magnetic limits of a relativistic conformal scalar are equivalent and we study the representation of the Carroll, Poincar\'e and BMS algebras that is realised on the resulting solution space. We then realise it as a quotient of the solution space of a free massless scalar in Minkowski spacetime with unusual falloff, in full analogy with the interpretation of Dirac's singleton as a shortened scalar in Anti de Sitter spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the ground state crystalline structure of nuclear matter in the $\omega$-meson variant of the Skyrme model. After minimizing energy with respect to variations of both the Skyrme field and the period lattice, we find four distinct periodic solutions which are similar to those found in the standard Skyrme model. We use these crystals to calculate coefficients in the Bethe--Weizs\"acker semi-empirical mass formula and the compression modulus of infinite nuclear matter, and find a significant improvement as compared with other variants of the Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Scale and Conformal Invariance in 2d Sigma Models, with an Application to N=4 Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By adapting previously known arguments concerning Ricci flow and the c-theorem, we give a direct proof that in a two-dimensional sigma-model with compact target space, scale invariance implies conformal invariance in perturbation theory. This argument, which applies to a general sigma-model constructed with a target space metric and B-field, is in accord with a more general proof in the literature that applies to arbitrary two-dimensional quantum field theories. Models with extended supersymmetry and a B-field are known to provide interesting test cases for the relation between scale invariance and conformal invariance in sigma-model perturbation theory. We give examples showing that in such models, the obstructions to conformal invariance suggested by general arguments can actually occur in models with target spaces that are not compact or complete. Thus compactness of the target space, or at least a suitable condition of completeness, is necessary as well as sufficient to ensure that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in models of this type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. We also conjecture that the formulas have a well-defined limit as the central charge approaches rational values. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also consider a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in $3$-space with $su(2)$ noncommutativity. The leading correction to the equations of motion due to noncommutativity is shown to be described by an effective monopole potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$, implying that the NR limit can be imposed before solving the strong constraint. We present the $c$-expansion of the generalised metric, which reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT at the (finite) leading order, and the $c$-expansion of the generalised frame, which contains divergences. We also extend this approach to the non-Abelian gauge field of Heterotic DFT assuming a convergent expansion for the O$(D,D+n)$ generalised metric. From this proposal, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for the bosonic part of the heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, compatible with O$(D,D)$-symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.09370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soft emission factor is a central ingredient in the factorization of generic $n$-particle gauge theory amplitudes with one soft gluon in the external state. We present the complete two-loop soft factor, capturing the leading power behavior in the soft-gluon momentum. At two loops, the color structure and the kinematic dependence of the soft factor become nontrivial as the soft gluon can couple to three hard partons for the first time (tripole terms). The nontrivial kinematic dependence of the tripole terms is of uniform, maximal transcendental weight, and can be expressed (in a "Euclidean" region) in terms of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. Our results are consistent with the behavior of the recently computed symbol of the two-loop five-particle amplitude in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In the limit where the outgoing soft gluon is also collinear with an incoming hard parton, potentially dangerous factorization-violating terms can arise, but they cancel after summing over colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01154v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We research on the neutrino pair annihilation $\nu+\overline{\nu}\longrightarrow e^{-}+e^{+}$ around a massive source in asymptotic safety. Since neutrinos and photons have the same geodesic equation around black holes, we can estimate the radius where the neutrinos will be released by obtaining a series of trajectory curves with various correction values $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius is influenced by the correction parameter $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius decreases with increasing the $\xi$. The ratio $\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{Q}_{Newt}}$ corresponding to the energy deposition per unit time over that in the Newtonian case is derived and calculated. We find that the quantum corrections to the black hole spacetime affect the emitted energy rate ratio for the annihilation. It is interesting that the more considerable quantum effect reduces the ratio value slightly. Although the energy conversion is damped because of the quantum correction, the energy deposition rate is enough during the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. The corrected annihilation process can become a source of gamma ray burst. We also investigate the derivative $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\dot{Q}}{\mathrm{d}r}$ relating to the star's radius $r$ to show that the quantum effect for the black hole will drop the ratio. The more manifest quantum gravity influence leads the weaker neutrino pair annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum-metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.</description>

Abstract: Complexity will be more and more essential in high-energy physics. It is naturally extended into the very early universe. Considering the universe as a quantum chaotic system, the curvature perturbation of the scalar field is identified with the two-mode squeezed state. By solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation, one can obtain the numerical solutions of the angle parameter and squeezing parameter. The solution of the squeezing parameter mainly determines the evolution of complexity. Our numeric indicates that the complexity of the modified dispersion relation will have a non-linear pattern after the horizon exits. Meanwhile, its corresponding Lyapunov index is also larger compared with the standard case. During the inflationary period, the complexity will irregularly oscillate and its scrambling time is also shorter compared with the standard case. Since the modified dispersion relation can be dubbed as the consequences of various frameworks of quantum gravity, it could be applicable to these frameworks. Finally, one can expect the framework of quantum gravity will lead to the fruitful evolution of complexity, which guides us in distinguishing various inflationary models.</description>

Abstract: Infrared divergence is a common feature of spinfoam models with a vanishing cosmological constant but is expected to disappear in presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant. In this paper, we investigate the spinfoam amplitude with cosmological constant introduced in arXiv:2109.00034 on the melon graph, which is known as the melonic radiative correction. The amplitude closely relates to the state-integral model of complex Chern-Simons theory. We prove that the melonic radiative correction is finite in presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant, in contrast to the infrared divergence of spinfoam models with a vanishing cosmological constant. In addition, we also analyze the scaling behavior of the radiative correction in the limit of small cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an anyon condensation web that interconnects a broad class of 2D fracton gauge theories with multipolar conservation laws at a microscopic level. We find that condensation of anyons triggers the emergence of additional spatially modulated symmetries, which has the general effect of increasing the number of super-selection anyon sectors, as well as the ground state degeneracy for systems with periodic boundary conditions. As explicit examples, we start with the rank-2 toric code model and implement various anyon condensation protocols, resulting in a range of 2D fracton-like theories, each with a distinct gauge structure. We also expand the scope of anyon condensation by introducing lattice defects into spatially modulated gauge theories and demonstrate that these geometric defects can be viewed as effective anyon condensations along the branch cut. Furthermore, we introduce the Multipartite Entanglement Mutual Information measure as a diagnostic tool to differentiate among various distinct multipole conserving phases. A captivating observation is the UV sensitivity of the mutual information sourced from multipartite entanglement in such spatially modulated gauge theories, which depends on the geometric cut and the system size, and exhibits periodic oscillations at large distances.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new way of understanding how chiral symmetry is realized in the high temperature phase of QCD. Based on the finding that a simple free instanton gas precisely describes the details of the lowest part of the spectrum of the lattice overlap Dirac operator, we propose an instanton-based random matrix model of QCD with dynamical quarks. Simulations of this model reveal that even for small quark mass the Dirac spectral density has a singularity at the origin, caused by a dilute gas of free instantons. Even though the interaction, mediated by light dynamical quarks creates small instanton-antiinstanton molecules, those do not influence the singular part of the spectrum, and this singular part is shown to dominate Banks-Casher type sums in the chiral limit. By generalizing the Banks-Casher formula for the singular spectrum, we show that in the chiral limit the chiral condensate vanishes if there are at least two massless flavors. Our model also indicates a possible way of resolving a long-standing debate, as it suggests that for two massless quark flavors the $U(1)_{A}$ symmetry is likely to remain broken up to arbitrarily high finite temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The combinatorially and the geometrically defined partial orders on the set of permutations coincide. We extend this result to $(0,1)$-matrices with fixed row and column sums. Namely, the Bruhat order induced by the geometry of a Cherkis bow variety of type A coincides with one of the two combinatorially defined Bruhat orders on the same set.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in dark matter superfluids: The evolution of black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of superfluid dark matter is characterized by self-interacting sub-eV particles that thermalize and condense to form a superfluid core in galaxies. Massive black holes at the center of galaxies, however, modify the dark matter distribution and result in a density enhancement in their vicinity known as dark matter spikes. The presence of these spikes affects the evolution of binary systems by modifying their gravitational wave emission and inducing dynamical friction effects on the orbiting bodies. In this work, we assess the role of dynamical friction for bodies moving through a superfluid core enhanced by a central massive black hole. As a first step, we compute the dynamical friction force experienced by bodies moving in a circular orbit. Then, we estimate the gravitational wave dephasing of the binary, showing that the effect of the superfluid drag force is beyond the reach of space-based experiments like LISA, contrarily to collisionless dark matter, therefore providing an opportunity to distinguish these dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Generalized cycles on Spectral Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized cycles can be thought of as the extension of form-cycle duality between holomorphic forms and cycles, to meromorphic forms and generalized cycles. They appeared as an ubiquitous tool in the study of spectral curves and integrable systems in the topological recursion approach. They parametrize deformations, implementing the special geometry, where moduli are periods, and derivatives with respect to moduli are other periods, or more generally "integrals", whence the name "generalized cycles". They appeared over the years in various works, each time in specific applied frameworks, and here we provide a comprehensive self-contained corpus of definitions and properties for a very general setting. The geometry of generalized cycles is also fascinating by itself.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature. As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Limiting the Number of Extra Dimensions with Shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In higher-dimensional theories, a graviton propagating in the bulk can follow a shorter path, known as a shortcut, compared to a photon propagating in a four-dimensional spacetime. Thus by combining the observations of gravitational waves and their electromagnetic counterparts, one can gain insights into the structure and number of extra dimensions. In this paper, we construct a braneworld model that allows the existence of shortcuts in a $D(=4+d)$-dimensional spacetime. It has been proven that the equations for modeling brane cosmology recover the standard Friedmann equations for the late universe. We derive analytically the graviton and photon horizon radii on the brane under the low-energy limit. With the event GW170817/GRB 170817A, we find that the number of extra dimensions has an upper limit of $d\leq9$. Because of the errors in the source redshift and time delay, this upper limit can be shifted to $d\leq4$ and $d\leq12$. Although with the joint constraint on the $\text{AdS}_{D}^{~}$ radius from torsion balance measurements, theories with large $d$ are not yet ruled out, our work provides a new way to limit the number of extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Improved model of large-field inflation with primordial black hole production in Starobinsky-like supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the "no-scale-type" K\"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type ("renormalizable") superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for indirect signals of $\mathscr{O}$(keV) dark matter annihilating or decaying into $\mathscr{O}$(eV) dark photons. These dark photons will be highly boosted and have decay lengths larger than the Milky Way, and can be absorbed by neutrino or dark matter experiments at a rate dependent on the photon-dark photon kinetic mixing parameter and the optical properties of the experiment. We show that current experiments can not probe new parameter space, but future large-scale gaseous detectors with low backgrounds (i.e. CYGNUS, NEXT, PANDAX-III) may be sensitive to this signal when the annihilation cross section is especially large.</description>

      <title>Finite modular axion and radiative moduli stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple setup which can stabilize a modulus field of the finite modular symmetry by the Coleman-Weinberg potential. Our scenario leads to a large hierarchy suppressing instanton-like corrections $e^{2\pi i\tau}$ and to a light axion identified as $\mathrm{Re} \tau$, where $\tau$ is the modulus field. This stabilization mechanism provides the axion solution to the strong CP problem. The potential has a minimum at a large $\mathrm{Im}\tau$ which suppresses explicit $U(1)_{\mathrm{PQ}}$ violation terms proportional to $e^{-2\pi {\mathrm{Im}\tau}}$, and hence the quality of the axion is ensured by the residual symmetry associated with the $T$-transformation, $\tau \to \tau +1$, around the fixed point $\tau \sim i\infty$.</description>

      <title>Arrow of time and gravitational entropy in collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the status of the gravitational arrow of time in the case of a spherical collapse of a fluid that conducts heat and radiates energy. In particular, we examine the results obtained by W. B. Bonnor in his 1985 paper where he found that the gravitational arrow of time was opposite to the thermodynamic arrow of time. The measure of gravitational epoch function $P$ used by Bonnor was given by the ratio of the Weyl square to the Ricci square. In this paper, we have assumed the measure of gravitational entropy $P_{1}$ to be given by the ratio of the Weyl scalar to the Kretschmann scalar. Our analysis indicates that Bonnor's result seems to be validated, i.e., the gravitational arrow and the thermodynamic arrow of time point in opposite directions. This strengthens the opinion that the Weyl proposal of gravitational entropy applies only to the universe as a whole (provided that we exclude the white holes).</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation assuming a simple viscous profile for the bulk and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>PeV-Scale SUSY and Cosmic Strings from F-term Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and SUSY breaking in the context of a B-L extension of MSSM which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The hidden sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be consistent with data, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range (1.2-100) TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of B-L cosmic strings. If these are metastable they interpret the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with dimensionless tension Gmu~(1-9.2)x10^-8. The mu parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about 71 GeV. Due to the prolonged matter dominated era the gravitational wave signal is suppressed at high frequencies. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze consequences of trying to replace dark matter and dark energy with models of stochastic spacetime. In particular, we analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that ``post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) effective across all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should enhance the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the de-convolution problem.</description>

      <title>Axial Gravitational Perturbations of Slowly-Rotating Compact Objects in General Relativity and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the axial gravitational perturbations of slowly-rotating compact objects which are assumed to be supported by anisotropic fluids. We find that the gravitational perturbations decouple from the matter perturbations for axial sectors. We obtain a master wave equation whose potential is fully determined by the metric functions. This equation makes the calculations of gravitational QNMs for rotating compact objects extremely easy in specific background configurations.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed at which the GW propagates The speed at which the GW propagates going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Constraining Millicharged dark matter with Gravitational positivity bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Hilltop Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>The Convergence Problem Of Gradient Expansion In The Relaxation Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>
