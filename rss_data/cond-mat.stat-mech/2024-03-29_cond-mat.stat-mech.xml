      <title>The bending rigidity exponent of a two-dimensional crystalline membrane with arbitrary number of flexural phonon modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the elastic behavior of two-dimensional crystalline membrane embedded into real space taking into account the presence an arbitrary number of flexural phonon modes $d_c$ (the number of out-of-plane deformation field components). The bending rigidity exponent $\eta$ is extracted by numerical simulation via Fourier Monte Carlo technique of the system behaviour in the universal regime. This universal quantity governess the correlation function of out-of-plane deformations at long wavelengths and defines the behaviour of renormalized bending rigidity at small momentum $\varkappa~\sim~1/q^{\eta}$. The resulting numerical estimates of the exponent for various $d_c$ are compared with the numbers obtained from the approximate analytical techniques.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. The performance of Ising machines on such problems heavily depends on encoding methods of constraints into penalties, but the optimal choice is non-trivial. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose to exploit the problem structure upon using Ising machines. Specifically, we apply fast two-stage post-processing to the outputs of Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation on medium-sized test instances shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of the encoding methods. We evaluate an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine with the proposed method and found that it achieves comparable results with existing heuristics.</description>

      <title>Phase coexistence in a weakly stochastic reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase coexistence in a weakly stochastic reaction-diffusion system without assuming a continuum description. Concretely, for $(2N+1)$ diffusion-coupled vessels in which a chemical reaction exhibiting bistability occurs, we derive a condition for the phase coexistence in the limit $N \to \infty$. We then find that the phase coexistence condition depends on the rate of hopping between neighboring vessels. The conditions in the high- and low-hopping-rate limits are expressed in terms of two different potentials which are determined from the chemical reaction model in a single vessel.</description>

      <title>Complete Integrability of the Problem of Full Statistics of Nonstationary Mass Transfer in the Simple Inclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simple Inclusion Process (SIP) interpolates between two well-known lattice gas models: the independent random walkers and the Kipnis-Marchiro-Presutti model. Here we study large deviations of nonstationary mass transfer in the SIP at long times in one dimension. We suppose that $N\gg 1$ particles start from a single lattice site, and we are interested in the full probability density $\mathcal{P}(M,N,T)$ of observing $M$ particles, $0\leq M\leq N$, at $x&gt;0$ at a specified time $T\gg 1$. At large times, the probability distribution has a large-deviation behavior, $-\ln \mathcal{P}(M,N,T) \simeq \sqrt{T} s(M/N,N/\sqrt{T})$. We determine the rate function $s$ exactly by uncovering and utilizing complete integrability, by the inverse scattering method, of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. We also analyze different asymptotic limits of the rate function $s$.</description>

      <title>Properties and Applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac Distribution</title>

Abstract: The most famous quasi-probability distribution, the Wigner function, has played a pivotal role in the development of a continuous-variable quantum theory that has clear analogues of position and momentum. However, the Wigner function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and observables' incompatibility.</description>

      <title>Expanding Density-Correlation Machine Learning Representations for Anisotropic Coarse-Grained Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based, atom-centered machine learning (ML) representations have been instrumental to the effective integration of ML within the atomistic simulation community. Many of these representations build off the idea of atoms as having spherical, or isotropic, interactions. In many communities, there is often a need to represent groups of atoms, either to increase the computational efficiency of simulation via coarse-graining or to understand molecular influences on system behavior. In such cases, atom-centered representations will have limited utility, as groups of atoms may not be well-approximated as spheres. In this work, we extend the popular Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) ML representation for systems consisting of non-spherical anisotropic particles or clusters of atoms. We show the power of this anisotropic extension of SOAP, which we deem \AniSOAP, in accurately characterizing liquid crystal systems and predicting the energetics of Gay-Berne ellipsoids and coarse-grained benzene crystals. With our study of these prototypical anisotropic systems, we derive fundamental insights into how molecular shape influences mesoscale behavior and explain how to reincorporate important atom-atom interactions typically not captured by coarse-grained models. Moving forward, we propose \AniSOAP as a flexible, unified framework for coarse-graining in complex, multiscale simulation.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Scaling beyond the Kibble-Zurek Prerequisite: Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional quantum critical point (QCP) characterized by order parameter fluctuations, the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) theory provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics. However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-thermodynamic enhancements in continuous thermal machines require energetic coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility of genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remains unclear. Here we show that only the presence of energetic coherence -- coherence between levels with different energies -- in steady-state quantum thermal machines can lead to genuine thermodynamic advantage. On the other hand, engines showing coherence between degenerate levels, or subjected to noise-induced coherence, are shown to be systematically outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active repulsive mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature in many biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. In addition to conservative interactions between active constituents, a non-equilibrium environment often induces effective non-reciprocal (NR) couplings. The full consequences, especially for systems with order parameters of different symmetries, still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active NR mixture exhibiting both, polar ordering and clustering using a combination of hydrodynamic theory, linear stability analysis, particle-based simulations and fluctuation analysis. We show that NR alignment interactions have profound influence on the density dynamics already far below the threshold related to spontaneous time dependency of polarization dynamics. In particular, NR alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering, and thus, partial demixing with single-species clusters chasing more dilute accumulations of the other species. Extremely large NR alignment eventually leads to a disappearance of clustered states.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Treating junction points as nodes and connections between them as links, we divide the networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. We find that the degree distribution of physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degree one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null-model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision models describe the sequential interactions of a system with independent ancillas. Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, in this Letter we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open dynamics while they wait, which may cause them to decohere. The system, which plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open dynamics whenever it is idle. We first show that this framework generalizes existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the classical queueing dynamics introduces non-trivial effects in the quantum collisions, that can lead to different phases in the system-ancilla response. We illustrate the idea with a model of coherence transfer under noisy waiting dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of a quantum committor in order to clarify reaction mechanisms and facilitate control in processes where coherent effects are important. With a quantum committor, we generalize the notion of a transition state to quantum superpositions and quantify the effect of interference on the progress of the reaction. The formalism is applicable to any linear quantum master equation supporting metastability for which absorbing boundary conditions designating the reactant and product states can be applied. We use this formalism to determine the dependence of the quantum transition state on coherences in a polaritonic system and optimize the initialization state of a conical intersection model to control reactive outcomes, achieving yields of the desired state approaching 100%. In addition to providing a practical tool, the quantum committor provides a conceptual framework for understanding reactions in cases when classical intuitions fail.</description>

      <title>Level-2 IFS Thermodynamic Formalism: Gibbs probabilities in the space of probabilities and the push-forward map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will denote by $\mathcal{M}$ the space of Borel probabilities on the symbolic space $\Omega=\{1,2...,m\}^\mathbb{N}$. $\mathcal{M}$ is equipped Monge-Kantorovich metric. We consider here the push-forward map $\mathfrak{T}:\mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ as a dynamical system. The space of Borel probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{M}$. Given a continuous function $A: \mathcal{M}\to \mathbb{R}$, an {\it a priori} probability $\Pi_0$ on $\mathcal{M}$, and a certain convolution operation acting on pairs of probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$, we define an associated Level-2 IFS Ruelle operator. We show the existence of an eigenfunction and an eigenprobability $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}$ for such an operator. Under a normalization condition for $A$, we show the existence of some $\mathfrak{T}$-invariant probabilities $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}.$ We are able to define the variational entropy of such $\hat{\Pi}$ and a related maximization pressure problem associated to $A$. In some particular examples, we show how to get eigenprobabilities solutions on $\mathfrak{M}$ for the Level-2 Thermodynamic Formalism problem from eigenprobabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ for the classical (Level-1) Thermodynamic Formalism. These examples highlight the fact that our approach is a natural generalization of the classic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a thermally isolated system performs a driving process in the quasistatic regime, its variation of average work $\langle W\rangle$ is equal to its quasistatic work $\langle W_{\rm qs}\rangle$. Even though presenting this simple definition, few attempts have been made to describe such equilibrium quantity from the fluctuation theorem point of view. In this work, based on Jarzynski's equality, four forms of such equality are deduced. To corroborate the results, a relation with the strong inequality $\langle W\rangle\ge \langle W_{\rm qs}\rangle$ is pursued. It is concluded that any of the fluctuation theorems deduced cannot derive such a postulate. Also, no contradiction is observed if the strong inequality is broken down. Based then on violations for systems starting in the microcanonical ensemble, a counter-example to the strong inequality at initial low temperature is presented.</description>

Abstract: One of the main objectives of science is the recognition of a general pattern in a particular phenomenon in some particular regime. In this work, this is achieved with the analytical expression for the optimal protocol that minimizes the thermodynamic work and its variance for finite-time, isothermal, and weak processes. The method that solves the Euler-Lagrange integral equation is quite general and depends only on the time-reversal symmetry of the optimal protocol. The solution is composed of a straight line with jumps at the boundaries and impulse-like terms. Already known results are deduced, and many new examples are solved corroborating this pattern. Slowly-varying and sudden cases are deduced in their appropriate asymptotic limits. Comparison with numerical procedures is limited by the nonavailability of the present methods of the literature to produce solutions in the space of distributions.</description>

      <title>Phase Crossover induced by Dynamical Many Body Localization in Periodically Driven Long-Range Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven integrable quantum spin systems. Under freezing conditions, quantum dynamics causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. In the LMG, the freezing conditions in the driving field suppresses the heating postulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by inducing dynamical many-body localization, or DMBL. This is in contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress ETH. DMBL has been validated by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the quasistationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits high-frequency localization only at freezing points. IPR localization in the LMG deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.</description>

      <title>Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to learn protocols that effect fast and efficient state-to-state transformations in simulation models of active particles. By encoding the protocol in the form of a neural network we use evolutionary methods to identify protocols that take active particles from one steady state to another, as quickly as possible or with as little energy expended as possible. Our results show that protocols identified by a flexible neural-network ansatz, which allows the optimization of multiple control parameters and the emergence of sharp features, are more efficient than protocols derived recently by constrained analytical methods. Our learning scheme is straightforward to use in experiment, suggesting a way of designing protocols for the efficient manipulation of active matter in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium tricritical behaviour in anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarised propagating magnetic field wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave has been extensively investigated by Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Both the effects of the bilinear exchange type and the single site anisotropies are thoroughly investigated. The time average magnetisation (over the complete cycle of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave) components play the role of dynamic order parameter. For fixed set of values of the strength of anisotropy and the field amplitudes, the system has been found to get dynamically ordered at a pseudocritical temperature. The pseudocritical temperature of such dynamic nonequilibrium phase transition has been found to depend on both the strength of anisotropy and the amplitudes of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave. A comprehensive phase diagram is represented here in the form of image plot of the pseudocritical temperature in the plane formed by the strength of anisotropy and field amplitudes. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium phase transition has been found discontinuous (first order) for higher values of the field amplitude and lower values of the anisotropy. On the other hand, the continuous (second order) transition has been noticed for lower values of the field amplitude and higher values of the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study Wilsonian momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms of the cutoff. We show that already at order $\left(4-d\right)^{1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the $\phi^{4}$ theory, there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor $\phi^{4}$ model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed if the different flavors have different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG). In future works we will study Wilsonian RG to order $\left(4-d\right)^{2}$ and find non-universal critical exponents that depend on the cutoff.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling function ansatz for finite-temperature jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We cast a nonzero-temperature analysis of the jamming transition into the framework of a scaling ansatz. We show that four distinct regimes for scaling exponents of thermodynamic derivatives of the free energy such as pressure, bulk and shear moduli, can be consolidated by introducing a universal scaling function with two branches. Both the original analysis and the scaling theory assume that the system always resides in a single basis in the energy landscape. The two branches are separated by a line $T^*(\Delta \phi)$ in the $T-\Delta \phi$ plane, where $\Delta \phi=\phi-\phi_c^\Lambda$ is the deviation of the packing fraction from its critical, jamming value, $\phi_c^\Lambda$, for that basin. The branch for $T&lt;T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reduces at $T=0$ to an earlier scaling ansatz that is restricted to $T=0$, $\Delta \phi \ge 0$, while the branch for $T&gt;T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reproduces exponents observed for thermal hard spheres. In contrast to the usual scenario for critical phenomena, the two branches are characterized by different exponents. We suggest that this unusual feature can be resolved by the existence of a dangerous irrelevant variable $u$, which can appear to modify exponents if the leading $u=0$ term is sufficiently small in the regime described by one of the two branches of the scaling function.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic approach to optimization in complex quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the energy minimum of a complex quantum Hamiltonian by employing a non-Markovian bath prepared in a low energy state. The energy minimization problem is thus turned into a thermodynamic cooling protocol in which we repeatedly put the system of interest in contact with a colder auxiliary system. By tuning the internal parameters of the bath, we show that the optimal cooling is obtained in a regime where the bath exhibits a quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. This result highlights the importance of collective effects in thermodynamic devices. We furthermore introduce a two-step protocol that combines the interaction with the bath with a measure of its energy. While this protocol does not destroy coherence in the system of interest, we show that it can further enhance the cooling effect.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions beyond Gaussianity: a single particle description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated measurements can induce entanglement phase transitions in the dynamics of quantum systems. Interacting models, both chaotic and integrable, generically show a stable volume-law entangled phase at low measurement rates which disappears for free, Gaussian fermions. Interactions break the Gaussianity of a dynamical map in its unitary part, but non-Gaussianity can be introduced through measurements as well. By comparing the entanglement and non-Gaussianity structure of different protocols, we propose a new single-particle indicator of the measurement-induced phase transition and we use it to argue in favour of the stability of the transition when non-Gaussianity is purely provided by measurements</description>

      <title>Exotic Symmetry Breaking Properties of Self-Dual Fracton Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties and phase transitions of two prototypical self-dual fracton spin models -- the tetrahedral Ising model and the fractal Ising model -- which correspond to error-correction procedures for the representative fracton codes of type-I and type-II, the checkerboard code and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error-free limit. They are endowed with exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with sub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters, correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral Ising model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that both models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous $L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our work provides new understanding of sub-dimensional symmetry breaking and makes an important step for studying quantum-error-correction properties of the checkerboard and Haah's codes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>

Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potentials of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental for the development of the equilibrium theory to determine near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging ions in the glass can be determined from the thermodynamic factor n, which is a parameter of the ion exchange isotherm. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass are discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. The resulting flux equation for the incoming ions in the glass is written in the form of a Fick equation with a variable, concentration-dependent, interdiffusion coefficient incorporating the thermodynamic factor n. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results. Surface concentration has been found substantially connected to the second parameter of the ion-exchange isotherm which is the equilibrium constant K and significatively influenced by the chemical composition of the ions reservoir.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>
