      <title>Bloch-Floquet band gaps for water waves over a periodic bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central object in the analysis of the water wave problem is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. This paper is devoted to the study of its spectrum in the context of the water wave system linearized near equilibrium in a domain with a variable bottom, assumed to be a $C^2$ periodic function. We use the analyticity of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator with respect to the bottom variation and combine it with general properties of elliptic systems and spectral theory for self-adjoint operators to develop a Bloch-Floquet theory and describe the structure of its spectrum. We find that under some conditions on the bottom variations, the spectrum is composed of bands separated by gaps, with explicit formulas for their sizes and locations.</description>

      <title>Zero dispersion limit of the Calogero-Moser derivative NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero-dispersion limit of the Calogero-Moser derivative NLS equation $$i\partial_tu+\partial_x^2 u \pm\,2D\Pi(|u|^2)u=0, \qquad x\in\mathbb{R},$$ starting from an initial data $u_0\in L^2_+(\mathbb{R})\cap L^\infty (\mathbb{R}),$ where $D=-i\partial_x,$ and $\Pi$ is the Szeg\H{o} projector defined as $\widehat{\Pi u}(\xi)=1_{[0,+\infty)}(\xi)\widehat{u}(\xi).$ We characterize the zero-dispersion limit solution by an explicit formula. Moreover, we identify it, in terms of the branches of the multivalued solution of the inviscid Burgers-Hopf equation. Finally, we infer that it satisfies a maximum principle.</description>

      <title>The existence theorem for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous slip boundary conditions in two-dimensional multiply-connected bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonhomogeneous boundary value problem for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations under the slip boundary conditions in two-dimensional multiply-connected bounded domains. Employing the approach of Korobkov-Pileckas-Russo (Ann. Math. 181(2), 769-807, 2015), we prove that this problem has a solution if the friction coefficient is sufficiently large compared with the kinematic viscosity constant and the curvature of the boundary. No additional assumption (other than the necessary requirement of zero total flux through the boundary) is imposed on the boundary data. We also show that such an assumption on the friction coefficient is redundant for the existence of a solution in the case when the fluxes across each connected component of the boundary are sufficiently small, or the domain and the given data satisfy certain symmetry conditions. The crucial ingredient of our proof is the fact that the total head pressure corresponding to the solution to the steady Euler equations takes a constant value on each connected component of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization for log-normal coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative homogenization results for the popular log-normal coefficients. Since the coefficients are neither bounded nor uniformly elliptic, standard proofs do not apply directly. Instead, we take inspiration from the approach developed for the nonlinear setting by the first two authors and capitalize on large-scale regularity results by Bella, Fehrmann, and Otto for degenerate coefficients in order to leverage an optimal control (in terms of scaling and stochastic integrability) of oscillations and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The sharp estimate of nodal sets for Dirichlet Laplace eigenfunctions in polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a bounded $n$-dimensional Lipschitz polytope, and let $\varphi_{\lambda}$ be a Dirichlet Laplace eigenfunction in $P$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$. We show that the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the nodal set of $\varphi_{\lambda}$ does not exceed $C(P)\sqrt{\lambda}$. Our result extends the previous ones in quaisconvex domains (including $C^1$ and convex domains) to general polytopes that are not necessarily quasiconvex.</description>

      <title>Global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the 2D nonhomogeneous primitive equations with density-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an initial-boundary value problem of the two-dimensional inhomogeneous primitive equations with density-dependent viscosity. The global well-posedness of strong solutions is established, provided the initial horizontal velocity is suitably small, that is, $\|\nabla u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}\leq \eta_{0}$ for suitably small $\eta_{0}&gt;0$. The initial data may contain vacuum. The proof is based on the local well-posedness and the blow-up criterion proved in \cite{0}, which states that if $T^{*}$ is the maximal existence time of the local strong solutions $(\rho,u,w,P)$ and $T^{*}&lt;\infty$, then \begin{equation*}
  \sup_{0\leq t&lt;T^{*}}(\left\|\nabla \rho(t)\right\|_{L^{\infty}}+\left\|\nabla^{2}\rho(t)\right\|_{L^{2}}+\left\|\nabla u(t)\right\|_{L^{2}})=\infty. \end{equation*} To complete the proof, it is required to make an estimate on a key term $\|\nabla u_{t}\|_{L_{t}^{1}L_{\Omega}^{2}}$. We prove that it is bounded and could be as small as desired under certain smallness conditions, by making use of the regularity result of hydrostatic Stokes equations and some careful time weighted estimates.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric inviscid fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal paper (Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 282, (1984).), the regularity of the free boundary of two-phase fluid in two dimensions via the so-called ACF energy functional was investigated. It was shown the $C^1$ regularity of the free boundaries and asserted that the two free boundaries coincide under some additional assumptions. Later on the standard technique of Harnack inequality could be applied to improve the regularity to $C^{1,\eta}$. A recent significant breakthrough in the regularity of two-phase fluid is due to De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, who investigated the free boundary of the two-phase fluid with the two-phase functional (De Philippis, Spolaor and Velichkov, Invent. Math., 225, (2021).), and the $C^{1,\eta}$ regularity of the whole free boundaries was given in dimension two. Moreover, the free boundaries of the two-phase fluids do not coincide and the zero level set may process positive Lebesgue measure. In this paper, we consider the free boundaries for the two-phase axisymmetric fluid and show the free boundary is $C^{1,\eta}$ smooth. The Lebesgue measure of the zero level set of may also be positive, and the main difference lies in the degenerate elliptic operator and the free boundary conditions. More precisely, we use partial boundary Harnack inequalities and establish a linearized problem, whose regularity of the solutions implies the flatness decay of the two-phase free boundaries. Then the iteration argument gives the smoothness of the free boundaries.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic approach to the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an obstacle problem for the mean curvature flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to an obstacle problem for the mean curvature flow equation by using a game-theoretic approximation, to which we extend that of Kohn and Serfaty (2006). Kohn and Serfaty (2006) give a deterministic two-person zero-sum game whose value functions approximate the solution to the level set mean curvature flow equation without obstacle functions. We prove that moving curves governed by the mean curvature flow converge in time to the boundary of the convex hull of obstacles under some assumptions on the initial curves and obstacles. Convexity of the initial set, as well as smoothness of the initial curves and obstacles, are not needed. In these proofs, we utilize properties of the game trajectories given by very elementary game strategies and consider reachability of each player. Also, when the equation has a driving force term, we present several examples of the asymptotic behavior, including a problem dealt in Giga, Mitake and Tran (2016).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of helical vortex filaments in non viscous incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study concentrated solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations in helical symmetry without swirl. We prove that any helical vorticity solution initially concentrated around helices of pairwise distinct radii remains concentrated close to filaments. As suggested by the vortex filament conjecture, we prove that those filaments are translating and rotating helices. Similarly to what is obtained in other frameworks, the localization is weak in the direction of the movement but strong in its normal direction, and holds on an arbitrary long time interval in the naturally rescaled time scale. In order to prove this result, we derive a new explicit formula for the singular part of the Biot-Savart kernel in a two-dimensional reformulation of the problem. This allows us to obtain an appropriate decomposition of the velocity field to reproduce recent methods used to describe the dynamics of vortex rings or point-vortices for the lake equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider a degenerated Fokker-Planck type differential operator associated to an adaptive Langevin dynamic.

      <description>arXiv:2403.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global existence of strong solutions for the 3D incompressible inhomogeneous viscoelastic system. We do not assume the "initial state" assumption and the "div-curl" structure inspired by the works [59,61]. It is a key to transform the original system into a suitable dissipative system by introducing a new effective tensor, which is useful to establish a series of energy estimates with appropriate time weights.</description>

      <title>Rotating spirals for three-component competition systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of rotating spirals for three-component competition-diffusion systems in $B_1\subset \mathbb{R}^2$:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \partial_tu_1-\Delta u_1=f(u_1)-\beta \alpha u_1u_2-\beta \gamma u_1 u_3,&amp; \text{in}\ B_1\times \mathbb{R}^+,
  \partial_tu_2-\Delta u_2=f(u_2)-\beta \gamma u_1u_2-\beta \alpha u_2 u_3,&amp; \text{in}\ B_1\times \mathbb{R}^+,
  \partial_tu_3-\Delta u_3=f(u_3)-\beta \alpha u_1u_3-\beta \gamma u_2 u_3,&amp; \text{in}\ B_1\times \mathbb{R}^+,
  u_i(\textbf{x},0)=u_{i,0}(\textbf{x}), i=1,2,3, &amp;\text{in} \ B_1,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $f(s)=\mu s(1-s)$, $\mu, \beta&gt;0$, $\alpha&gt;\gamma&gt;0$. For the Neumann problem, we establish the existence of rotating spirals by applying the multi-parameter bifurcation theorem. As a byproduct, the instability of the constant positive solution is proved. In addition, for the non-homogeneous Dirichlet problem, the Rothe fixed point theorem is employed to prove the existence of rotating spirals.</description>

      <title>Regularities for solutions to the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets in a pointed closed convex cone was proposed and a weak solution to the corresponding Monge-Amp\`ere equation is provided. In this paper, we consider the regularities of solutions to this problem. More generally, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets which amounts to solving a Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations. Our main purpose is to show the existence, regularity and uniqueness of solution to this problem in case $p\geq 1$ by studying variational properties for a family of Monge-Amp\`ere functinals. We also discuss the existence and optimal global H\"older regularity in case $p&lt;1$ and $q\geq n$.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and local solution to the non-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider and generalize a model, recently proposed and analytically investigated in its quasi-stationary approximation by the authors, for visco-elasticity with large deformations and conditional compatibility, where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors. The model takes the form of a system of integro-differential coupled equations. Here, its derivation is generalized to consider mixed boundary conditions, which may represent a wider range of physical applications then the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in our previous contribution. This also introduces nontrivial technical difficulties in the theoretical framework, related to the definition and the regularity of the solutions of elliptic operators with mixed boundary conditions. As a novel contribution, we develop the analysis of the fully non-stationary version of the system where we consider inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a local in time weak solution in three space dimensions, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of CVOD-based Column Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there exists a rich array of matrix column subset selection problem (CSSP) algorithms for use with interpolative and CUR-type decompositions, their use can often become prohibitive as the size of the input matrix increases. In an effort to address these issues, the authors in \cite{emelianenko2024adaptive} developed a general framework that pairs a column-partitioning routine with a column-selection algorithm. Two of the four algorithms presented in that work paired the Centroidal Voronoi Orthogonal Decomposition (\textsf{CVOD}) and an adaptive variant (\textsf{adaptCVOD}) with the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (\textsf{DEIM}) \cite{sorensen2016deim}. In this work, we extend this framework and pair the \textsf{CVOD}-type algorithms with any CSSP algorithm that returns linearly independent columns. Our results include detailed error bounds for the solutions provided by these paired algorithms, as well as expressions that explicitly characterize how the quality of the selected column partition affects the resulting CSSP solution.</description>

      <title>On the signature of an image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the importance of the 1D signature which can be seen as a functional defined along a path, has been pivotal in both path-wise stochastic calculus and the analysis of time series data. By considering an image as a two-parameter function that takes values in a $d$-dimensional space, we introduce an extension of the path signature to images. We address numerous challenges associated with this extension and demonstrate that the 2D signature satisfies a version of Chen's relation in addition to a shuffle-type product. Furthermore, we show that specific variations of the 2D signature can be recursively defined, thereby satisfying an integral-type equation. We analyze the properties of the proposed signature, such as continuity, invariance to stretching, translation and rotation of the underlying image. Additionally, we establish that the proposed 2D signature over an image satisfies a universal approximation property.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Two Solutes Transport in a Poroelastic Material and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using well-known mathematical foundations of the elasticity theory, a mathematical model for two solutes transport in a poroelastic material (soft tissue is a typical example) is suggested. It is assumed that molecules of essentially different sizes dissolved in fluid and are transported through pores of different sizes. The stress tensor, the main force leading to the material deformation, is taken not only in the standard linear form but also with an additional nonlinear part. The model is constructed in 1D space and consists of six nonlinear equations. It is shown that the governing equations are integrable in stationary case, therefore all steady-state solutions are constructed. The obtained solutions are used in an example for healthy and tumour tissue, in particular, tissue displacements are calculated and compared for parameters taken from experimental data in cases of the linear and nonlinear stress tensors. Since the governing equations are non-integrable in non-stationary case, the Lie symmetry analysis is used in order to construct time-dependent exact solutions. Depending on parameters arising in the governing equations, several special cases with non-trivial Lie symmetries are identified. As a result, multi-parameter families of exact solutions are constructed including those in terms of special functions(hypergeometric and Bessel functions). A possible application of the solutions obtained is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Slender vortex filaments in the Boussinesq Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for the motion of slender vortex filaments is extended to include the effect of gravity. The model, initially introduced by Callegari and Ting (SIAM, J. of App. Math., (1978), vol. 35, pp. 148-175), is based on a matched asymptotic expansion in which the outer solution, given by the Biot-Savart law, is matched with the inner solution derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on recent work by Harikrishnan et al (Phys. of Fluids, (2023), vol. 35) the Boussinesq approximation is applied such that the density variations only enter in the gravity term. However, unlike Harikrishnan et al. (2023) the density variation enters at a lower order in the asymptotic expansion, and thus has a more significant impact on the self-induced velocity of the vortex filament. In this regime, which corresponds to the regime studied by Chang and Smith (J. of Fl. Mech., (2018), vol. 857), the effect of gravity is given by an alteration of the core constant, which couples the motion of the filament to the motion within the vortical core, in addition to a change in the compatability conditions (evolution equations) which determine the leading order azimuthal and tangential velocity fields in the vortex core. The results are used to explain certain properties of bouyant vortex rings, as well as qualitatively explore the impact of gravity on tornado type atmospheric vorticies.</description>

      <title>Markov processes with jump kernels decaying at the boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a general theory for non-local singular operators of the type $$
  L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}f(x)=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \int_{D,\, |y-x|&gt;\epsilon}\big(f(y)-f(x)\big) \mathcal{B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}\,dy, $$ and $$ L f(x)=L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}f(x) - \kappa(x) f(x), $$ in case $D$ is a $C^{1,1}$ open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$. The function $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ above may vanish at the boundary of $D$, and the killing potential $\kappa$ may be subcritical or critical.
  From a probabilistic point of view we study the reflected process on the closure $\overline{D}$ with infinitesimal generator $L^{\mathcal{B}}_{\alpha}$, and its part process on $D$ obtained by either killing at the boundary $\partial D$, or by killing via the killing potential $\kappa(x)$. The general theory developed in this work (i) contains subordinate killed stable processes in $C^{1,1}$ open sets as a special case, (ii) covers the case when $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ is bounded between two positive constants and is well approximated by certain H\"older continuous functions, and (iii) extends the main results known for the half-space in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The main results of the work are the boundary Harnack principle and its possible failure, and sharp two-sided Green function estimates. Our results on the boundary Harnack principle completely cover the corresponding earlier results in the case of half-space. Our Green function estimates extend the corresponding earlier estimates in the case of half-space to bounded $C^{1, 1}$ open sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows with non-negative Ricci curvature where the curvature is pointwise controlled by the scalar curvature and bounded by $C/t$, starting at metric cones which are Reifenberg outside the tip. We show that any such flow behaves like a self-similar solution up to an exponential error in time. As an application, we show that smooth $n$-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly PIC1-pinched, with positive asymptotic volume ratio, are Euclidean. This confirms a higher dimensional version of a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott under the assumption of non-collapsing. It also yields a new and more direct proof of the original conjecture of Hamilton and Lott in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uniform in time weak propagation of chaos on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the long time behaviour of weakly interacting diffusive particle systems on the d-dimensional torus. Our main result is to show that, under certain regularity conditions, the weak error between the empirical distribution of the particle system and the theoretical law of the limiting process (governed by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation) is of the order O(1/N), uniform in time on [0, infinity), where N is the number of particles in the interacting diffusion. This comprises general interaction terms with a small enough mean-field dependence together with interactions terms driven by an H-stable potential. Our approach relies on a systematic analysis of the long-time behaviour of the derivatives of the semigroup generated by the McKean-Vlasov SDE, which may be explicitly computed through the linearised Fokker-Planck equation. Ergodic estimates for the latter hence play a key role in our analysis. We believe that this strategy is flexible enough to cover a wider broad of situations. To wit, we succeed in adapting it to the super-critical Kuramoto model, for which the corresponding McKean-Vlasov equation has several invariant measures.</description>

      <title>On codimension one stability of the soliton for the 1D focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the codimension one asymptotic stability problem for the soliton of the focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation on the line under even perturbations. The main obstruction to full asymptotic stability on the center-stable manifold is a small divisor in a quadratic source term of the perturbation equation. This singularity is due to the threshold resonance of the linearized operator and the absence of null structure in the nonlinearity. The threshold resonance of the linearized operator produces a one-dimensional space of slowly decaying Klein-Gordon waves, relative to local norms. In contrast, the closely related perturbation equation for the sine-Gordon kink does exhibit null structure, which makes the corresponding quadratic source term amenable to normal forms [76].
  The main result of this work establishes decay estimates up to exponential time scales for small "codimension one type" perturbations of the soliton of the focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation. The proof is based upon a super-symmetric approach to the study of modified scattering for 1D nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations with P\"oschl-Teller potentials from [76], and an implementation of a version of an adapted functional framework introduced in [39].</description>

Abstract: A detailed numerical study of solutions to the Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations in 2D with vanishing curl of the velocity field is presented. The transverse stability of line solitary waves, 1D solitary waves being exact solutions of the 2D equations independent of the second variable, is established numerically. The study of localized initial data as well as crossing 1D solitary waves does not give an indication of existence of stable structures in SGN solutions localized in two spatial dimensions. For the numerical experiments, an approach based on a Fourier spectral method with a Krylov subspace technique is applied.</description>

Abstract: We generalise results by Lamberti and Lanza de Cristoforis (2005) concerning the continuity of projections onto eigenspaces of self-adjoint differential operators with compact inverses as the (spatial) domain of the functions is perturbed in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main case of interest is the Dirichlet Laplacian. We extend these results from bounds from $H_0^1$ to $H_0^1$ to bounds from $L^p$ to $L^p$, under the assumption that $(-\Delta^{-1}-z)^{-1}$ is $L^p$ bounded when $z$ lies outside of the spectrum of $-\Delta^{-1}$. We show that this assumption is met if the initial domain is a square or a rectangle.</description>

      <title>Stability and instability of the quasilinear Gross--Pitaevskii dark solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity. In previous works, we obtained a continuous branch of traveling waves, given by dark solitons indexed by their speed. Neglecting the quasilinear term, one recovers the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, for which the branch of dark solitons is stable. Moreover, Z.~Lin showed that the Vakhitov--Kolokolov~(VK) stability criterion (in terms of the momentum of solitons) holds for general semilinear equations with nonvanishing conditions at infinity.
  In the quasilinear case, we prove that the VK stability criterion still applies, by generalizing Lin's arguments. Therefore, we deduce that the branch of dark solitons is stable for weak quasilinear interactions. For stronger quasilinear interactions, a cusp appears in the energy-momentum diagram, implying the stability of fast waves and the instability of slow waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The function that maps a family of probability measures to the solution of the dual entropic optimal transport problem is known as the Schr\"odinger map. We prove that when the cost function is $\mathcal{C}^{k+1}$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}^*$ then this map is Lipschitz continuous from the $L^2$-Wasserstein space to the space of $\mathcal{C}^k$ functions. Our result holds on compact domains and covers the multi-marginal case. We also include regularity results under negative Sobolev metrics weaker than Wasserstein under stronger smoothness assumptions on the cost. As applications, we prove displacement smoothness of the entropic optimal transport cost and the well-posedness of certain Wasserstein gradient flows involving this functional, including the Sinkhorn divergence and a multi-species system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the small-time controllability problem for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R}^N$ in the presence of magnetic and electric external fields. We choose a particular framework where the equation becomes $i\partial_t \psi = [-\Delta+u_0(t)h_{\vec{0}}+\langle u(t), P\rangle +\kappa|\psi|^{2p}]\psi$. Here, the control operators are defined by the zeroth Hermite function $h_{\vec{0}}(x)$ and the momentum operator $P=i\nabla$. In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of (NLS) as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals $u_0$ and $u$. We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified. Secondly, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in (NLS) is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific non-commutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.</description>

      <title>A PDE approach for solving the characteristic function of the generalised signature process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The signature of a path, as a fundamental object in Rough path theory, serves as a generating function for non-commutative monomials on path space. It transforms the path into a grouplike element in the tensor algebra space, summarising the path faithfully up to a generalised form of re-parameterisation (a negligible equivalence class in this context). Our paper concerns stochastic processes and studies the characteristic function of the path signature of the stochastic process. In contrast to the expected signature, it determines the law on the random signatures without any regularity condition. The computation of the characteristic function of the random signature offers potential applications in stochastic analysis and machine learning, where the expected signature plays an important role. In this paper, we focus on a time-homogeneous It\^o diffusion process, and adopt a PDE approach to derive the characteristic function of its signature defined at any fixed time horizon. A key ingredient of our approach is the introduction of the generalised-signature process. This lifting enables us to establish the Feynman-Kac-type theorem for the characteristic function of the generalised-signature process by following the martingale approach. Moreover, as an application of our results, we present a novel derivation of the joint characteristic function of Brownian motion coupled with the L\'evy area, leveraging the structure theorem of anti-symmetric matrices.</description>
