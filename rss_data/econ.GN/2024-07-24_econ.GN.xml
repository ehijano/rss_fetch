      <title>Stock-driven Household Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of stockholding on households' attention to the macroeconomy. Households' attentiveness is measured by their accuracy of inflation expectations and perceptions. Relative to non-stockholders, stockholders produce more accurate inflation forecasts and backcasts, disagree less about future inflation, and adjust their outlook more responsively to news, suggesting that stock-market participation raises households' attention. Frequent changes in stock prices incentivize stockholders to closely monitor financial markets for optimal trading, given the low cost of acquiring information. Consequently, paying attention to the macroeconomy helps hedge the risks associated with holding stocks. Therefore, attention heterogeneity driven by stockholdings can be a channel through which the distributional consequences of monetary policy are created.</description>

      <title>Similarity of Information and Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a canonical collective action game with incomplete information. Individuals attempt to coordinate to achieve a shared goal, while also facing a temptation to free-ride. Consuming more similar information about the fundamentals can help them coordinate, but it can also exacerbate free-riding. Our main result shows that more similar information facilitates (impedes) achieving a common goal when achieving the goal is sufficiently challenging (easy). We apply this insight to show why insufficiently powerful authoritarian governments may face larger protests when attempting to restrict press freedom, and why informational diversity in committees is beneficial when each vote carries more weight.</description>

      <title>Testing Forecast Rationality for Measures of Central Tendency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12545v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rational respondents to economic surveys may report as a point forecast any measure of the central tendency of their (possibly latent) predictive distribution, for example the mean, median, mode, or any convex combination thereof. We propose tests of forecast rationality when the measure of central tendency used by the respondent is unknown. We overcome an identification problem that arises when the measures of central tendency are equal or in a local neighborhood of each other, as is the case for (exactly or nearly) symmetric distributions. As a building block, we also present novel tests for the rationality of mode forecasts. We apply our tests to income forecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations. We find these forecasts are rationalizable as mode forecasts, but not as mean or median forecasts. We also find heterogeneity in the measure of centrality used by respondents when stratifying the sample by past income, age, job stability, and survey experience.</description>
