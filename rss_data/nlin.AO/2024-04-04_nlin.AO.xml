      <title>Semantic Information Theory in a feedback-control Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>

      <title>Transient Reviving Dynamics with an Exact Solution for Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to examine transient dynamics in a class of non-autonomous delay differential equations. Exact solutions for these equations are obtained using the Lambert $W$ function alongside an appropriately chosen initial function. These solutions provide a reliable approximation for transient dynamics when the initial functions are not markedly distinct. We explore a non-autonomous equation that exhibits a distinctive phenomenon of reviving dynamics as an illustrative example. The derived exact solutions effectively encapsulate the qualitative characteristics of this reviving dynamics over various delay values.</description>

      <title>Solving a Delay Differential Equation through Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce and explore a delay differential equation that lends itself to explicit solutions in the Fourier-transformed space. Through the careful alignment of the initial function, we can construct a highly accurate solution to the equation. These findings open new avenues for understanding delay systems, demonstrating the efficacy of Fourier transform techniques in capturing transient oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Positioning is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One can drive safely with a GPS without memorizing a world map (not to mention the dark regions that humans have never explored). Such a locality-based attention mechanism has a profound implication on our understanding of how the brain works. This paper refines the existing embodied cognition framework by turning the locality from a constraint to an advantage. Analogous to GPS-based navigation, positioning represents a computationally more efficient solution to flexible behaviors than reconstruction. This simple intuition implies that {\em positioning is all you need} to understand cognitive functions generated by hippocampal-neocortical systems. That is, the neocortex generates thousands of local maps whose indexing is maintained by the hippocampus. Geometrically, we present a simple manifold positioning framework to explain the principle of localized embodied cognition. The positioning operation implemented by the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a nonlinear projection linking the discovery of local subspace structure by the neocortex (a sensorimotor machine interacting with the world locally) for the navigation task in mind without discovering global manifold topology.</description>
