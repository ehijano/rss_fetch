      <title>A Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem Involving Reconfigurable Machine Tools Under Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Industry 5.0 has introduced new demands for manufacturing companies, requiring a shift in how production schedules are managed to address human centered, environmental, and economic goals comprehensively. The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), which involves processing operations on various capable machines, accurately reflects the complexities of modern manufacturing settings. This paper investigates the FJSSP involving reconfigurable machine tools with configuration dependent setup times, while integrating human aspects like worker assignments, moving time, and rest periods, as well as minimizing total energy consumption. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize these objectives. The model determines the assignment of operations to machines, workers, and configurations while sequencing operations, scheduling worker movements, and respecting rest periods, and minimizing overall energy consumption. Given the NPhard nature of the FJSSP with worker assignments and reconfigurable tools, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. This metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm features a three layer chromosome encoding method, specialized crossover and mutation strategies, and neighborhood search mechanisms to enhance solution quality and diversity. Comparisons of MA with MIP and genetic algorithms (GA) on benchmark instances demonstrate the MA efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for larger problem instances where MIP becomes impractical. This research paves the way for sustainable and resilient production schedules tailored for the factory of the future under the Industry 5.0 paradigm. The work bridges a crucial gap in current literature by integrating worker and environmental impact into the FJSSP with reconfigurable machine models.</description>

      <title>ETTFS: An Efficient Training Framework for Time-to-First-Spike Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their biologically inspired, event-driven nature, making them highly suitable for neuromorphic hardware. Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) coding, where neurons fire only once during inference, offers the benefits of reduced spike counts, enhanced energy efficiency, and faster processing. However, SNNs employing TTFS coding often suffer from diminished classification accuracy. This paper presents an efficient training framework for TTFS that not only improves accuracy but also accelerates the training process. Unlike most previous approaches, we first identify two key issues limiting the performance of TTFS neurons: information disminishing and imbalanced membrane potential distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel initialization strategy. Additionally, we introduce a temporal weighting decoding method that aggregates temporal outputs through a weighted sum, supporting BPTT. Moreover, we re-evaluate the pooling layer in TTFS neurons and find that average pooling is better suited than max-pooling for this coding scheme. Our experimental results show that the proposed training framework leads to more stable training and significant performance improvements, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Evolutionary Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level. Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.</description>

      <title>Non-binary artificial neuron with phase variation implemented on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first artificial quantum neuron models followed a similar path to classic models, as they work only with discrete values. Here we introduce an algorithm that generalizes the binary model manipulating the phase of complex numbers. We propose, test, and implement a neuron model that works with continuous values in a quantum computer. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our model may work in a hybrid training scheme utilizing gradient descent as a learning algorithm. This work represents another step in the direction of evaluation of the use of artificial neural networks efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Neurobench: DCASE 2020 Acoustic Scene Classification benchmark on XyloAudio 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XyloAudio is a line of ultra-low-power audio inference chips, designed for in- and near-microphone analysis of audio in real-time energy-constrained scenarios. Xylo is designed around a highly efficient integer-logic processor which simulates parameter- and activity-sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) using a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. Neurons on Xylo are quantised integer devices operating in synchronous digital CMOS, with neuron and synapse state quantised to 16 bit, and weight parameters quantised to 8 bit. Xylo is tailored for real-time streaming operation, as opposed to accelerated-time operation in the case of an inference accelerator. XyloAudio includes a low-power audio encoding interface for direct connection to a microphone, designed for sparse encoding of incident audio for further processing by the inference core. In this report we present the results of DCASE 2020 acoustic scene classification audio benchmark dataset deployed to XyloAudio 2. We describe the benchmark dataset; the audio preprocessing approach; and the network architecture and training approach. We present the performance of the trained model, and the results of power and latency measurements performed on the XyloAudio 2 development kit. This benchmark is conducted as part of the Neurobench project.</description>

      <title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Synaptic Neural Balance: From Local to Global Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of synaptic neural balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given regularizer, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. Gradient descent on the error function alone does not converge in general to a balanced state, where every neuron is in balance, even when starting from a balanced state. However, gradient descent on the regularized error function ought to converge to a balanced state, and thus network balance can be used to assess learning progress. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. Simulations show that balancing neurons prior to learning, or during learning in alternation with gradient descent steps, can improve learning speed and final performance.</description>

      <title>Natural Counterfactuals With Necessary Backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks meet Encoded Neural Representations -- Addressing Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.</description>
