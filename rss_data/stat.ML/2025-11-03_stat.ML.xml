      <title>Overspecified Mixture Discriminant Analysis: Exponential Convergence, Statistical Guarantees, and Remote Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the classification error of Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) in scenarios where the number of mixture components exceeds those present in the actual data distribution, a condition known as overspecification. We use a two-component Gaussian mixture model within each class to fit data generated from a single Gaussian, analyzing both the algorithmic convergence of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the statistical classification error. We demonstrate that, with suitable initialization, the EM algorithm converges exponentially fast to the Bayes risk at the population level. Further, we extend our results to finite samples, showing that the classification error converges to Bayes risk with a rate $n^{-1/2}$ under mild conditions on the initial parameter estimates and sample size. This work provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the performance of overspecified MDA, which is often used empirically in complex data settings, such as image and text classification. To validate our theory, we conduct experiments on remote sensing datasets.</description>

      <title>Decreasing Entropic Regularization Averaged Gradient for Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding entropic regularization to Optimal Transport (OT) problems has become a standard approach for designing efficient and scalable solvers. However, regularization introduces a bias from the true solution. To mitigate this bias while still benefiting from the acceleration provided by regularization, a natural solver would adaptively decrease the regularization as it approaches the solution. Although some algorithms heuristically implement this idea, their theoretical guarantees and the extent of their acceleration compared to using a fixed regularization remain largely open. In the setting of semi-discrete OT, where the source measure is continuous and the target is discrete, we prove that decreasing the regularization can indeed accelerate convergence. To this end, we introduce DRAG: Decreasing (entropic) Regularization Averaged Gradient, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm where the regularization decreases with the number of optimization steps. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that DRAG benefits from decreasing regularization compared to a fixed scheme, achieving an unbiased $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sample and iteration complexity for both the OT cost and the potential estimation, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ rate for the OT map. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments that validate the effectiveness of DRAG and highlight its practical advantages.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Optimal Transport Problem and Action Matching with Optimal Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) method in generative modeling maps arbitrary probability distributions by constructing an interpolation between them and then learning the vector field that defines ODE for this interpolation. Recently, it was shown that FM can be modified to map distributions optimally in terms of the quadratic cost function for any initial interpolation. To achieve this, only specific optimal vector fields, which are typical for solutions of Optimal Transport (OT) problems, need to be considered during FM loss minimization. In this note, we show that considering only optimal vector fields can lead to OT in another approach: Action Matching (AM). Unlike FM, which learns a vector field for a manually chosen interpolation between given distributions, AM learns the vector field that defines ODE for an entire given sequence of distributions.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Model-Aware Counterfactual Explanations for Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their enormous predictive power, machine learning models are often unsuitable for applications in regulated industries such as finance, due to their limited capacity to provide explanations. While model-agnostic frameworks such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after. Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome, may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning, exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more useful than Shapley values.</description>

      <title>Minimax-Optimal Two-Sample Test with Sliced Wasserstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric two-sample testing using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. While prior theoretical and empirical work indicates that the SW distance offers a promising balance between strong statistical guarantees and computational efficiency, its theoretical foundations for hypothesis testing remain limited. We address this gap by proposing a permutation-based SW test and analyzing its performance. The test inherits finite-sample Type I error control from the permutation principle. Moreover, we establish non-asymptotic power bounds and show that the procedure achieves the minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$ over multinomial and bounded-support alternatives, matching the optimal guarantees of kernel-based tests while building on the geometric foundations of Wasserstein distances. Our analysis further quantifies the trade-off between the number of projections and statistical power. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the test combines finite-sample validity with competitive power and scalability, and -- unlike kernel-based tests, which require careful kernel tuning -- it performs consistently well across all scenarios we consider.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Analysis of DDPM for General Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in generating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used samplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its empirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its convergence properties -- remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler and establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition parameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler with accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of $$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2}\right)~\text{in Kullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the number of iterations, and $\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$. This result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L &lt; \sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence analysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it reveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an interesting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization on Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs. Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are tailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\'ern Gaussian process prior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric graphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently smooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the smoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\'ern prior is represented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on a synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori estimation on a telecommunication network.</description>

      <title>Multi-Representation Attention Framework for Underwater Bioacoustic Denoising and Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary faces extreme challenges: calls span low-frequency moans to ultrasonic clicks, often overlap, and are embedded in variable anthropogenic and environmental noise. We introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification. Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context. Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios. Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms (gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both in-distribution and OOD data.</description>

      <title>Residual Distribution Predictive Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal predictive systems are sets of predictive distributions with theoretical out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The calibration guarantees are typically that the set of predictions contains a forecast distribution whose prediction intervals exhibit the correct marginal coverage at all levels. Conformal predictive systems are constructed using conformity measures that quantify how well possible outcomes conform with historical data. However, alternative methods have been proposed to construct predictive systems with more appealing theoretical properties. We study an approach to construct predictive systems that we term Residual Distribution Predictive Systems. In the split conformal setting, this approach nests conformal predictive systems with a popular class of conformity measures, providing an alternative perspective on the classical approach. In the full conformal setting, the two approaches differ, and the new approach has the advantage that it does not rely on a conformity measure satisfying fairly stringent requirements to ensure that the predictive system is well-defined; it can readily be implemented alongside any point-valued regression method to yield predictive systems with out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The empirical performance of this approach is assessed using simulated data, where it is found to perform competitively with conformal predictive systems. However, the new approach offers considerable scope for implementation with alternative regression methods.</description>

      <title>Robust fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional multivariate time series with outlier detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy clustering provides a natural framework for modeling partial memberships, particularly important in multivariate time series (MTS) where state boundaries are often ambiguous. For example, in EEG monitoring of driver alertness, neural activity evolves along a continuum (from unconscious to fully alert, with many intermediate levels of drowsiness) so crisp labels are unrealistic and partial memberships are essential. However, most existing algorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with temporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and contamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously: (i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and moderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming, exponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically select all required hyperparameters. These components enable RFCPCA to capture latent temporal structure, provide calibrated membership uncertainty, and flag series-level outliers while remaining stable under contamination. On driver drowsiness EEG, RFCPCA improves clustering accuracy over related methods and yields a more reliable characterization of uncertainty and outlier structure in MTS.</description>

      <title>Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which naturally supports both representations. We train language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} - consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Bounds for Length Generalization in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al. (2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer, and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be "simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.</description>

      <title>AI-boosted rare event sampling to characterize extreme weather</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and understanding how climate change affects them, is crucial for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, observational datasets are too short and physics-based global climate models (GCMs) are too computationally expensive to obtain robust statistics for the rarest, yet most impactful, extreme events. AI-based emulators have shown promise for predictions at weather and even climate timescales, but they struggle on extreme events with few or no examples in their training dataset. Rare event sampling (RES) algorithms have previously demonstrated success for some extreme events, but their performance depends critically on a hard-to-identify "score function", which guides efficient sampling by a GCM. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, AI+RES, which uses ensemble forecasts of an AI weather emulator as the score function to guide highly efficient resampling of the GCM and generate robust (physics-based) extreme weather statistics and associated dynamics at 30-300x lower cost. We demonstrate AI+RES on mid-latitude heatwaves, a challenging test case requiring a score function with predictive skill many days in advance. AI+RES, which synergistically integrates AI, RES, and GCMs, offers a powerful, scalable tool for studying extreme events in climate science, as well as other disciplines in science and engineering where rare events and AI emulators are active areas of research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Landscapes for Better Minima along Valleys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning. However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E" for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses) in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario, large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy (generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of 2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model selection and misspecification testing in imaging inverse problems only from noisy and partial measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis: Information Geometry Approach for Dimensionality Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction maps labeled data into a low-dimensional feature space while preserving class discriminability. A common approach is to maximize a statistical measure of dissimilarity between classes in the feature space. Information geometry provides an alternative framework for measuring class dissimilarity, with the potential for improved insights and novel applications. Information geometry, which is grounded in Riemannian geometry, uses the Fisher information metric, a local measure of discriminability that induces the Fisher-Rao distance. Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a linear dimensionality reduction method that maximizes Fisher-Rao distances between class-conditional distributions, under Gaussian assumptions. We motivate the Fisher-Rao distance as a good proxy for discriminability. We show that SQFA features support good classification performance with Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on three real-world datasets. SQFA provides a novel framework for supervised dimensionality reduction, motivating future research in applying information geometry to machine learning and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Dimensional Item Factor Analysis: A Deep Adversarial Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning and representation learning have transformed item factor analysis (IFA) in the item response theory (IRT) literature by enabling more efficient and accurate parameter estimation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</description>

      <title>DO-IQS: Dynamics-Aware Offline Inverse Q-Learning for Optimal Stopping with Unknown Gain Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Inverse Optimal Stopping (IOS) problem where, based on stopped expert trajectories, one aims to recover the optimal stopping region through the continuation and stopping gain functions approximation. The uniqueness of the stopping region allows the use of IOS in real-world applications with safety concerns. Although current state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning methods recover both a Q-function and the corresponding optimal policy, they fail to account for specific challenges posed by optimal stopping problems. These include data sparsity near the stopping region, the non-Markovian nature of the continuation gain, a proper treatment of boundary conditions, the need for a stable offline approach for risk-sensitive applications, and a lack of a quality evaluation metric. These challenges are addressed with the proposed Dynamics-Aware Offline Inverse Q-Learning for Optimal Stopping (DO-IQS), which incorporates temporal information by approximating the cumulative continuation gain together with the world dynamics and the Q-function without querying to the environment. In addition, a confidence-based oversampling approach is proposed to treat the data sparsity problem. We demonstrate the performance of our models on real and artificial data including an optimal intervention for the critical events problem.</description>

Abstract: This article provides a practical introduction to kernel discrepancies, focusing on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and the Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD). Various estimators for these discrepancies are presented, including the commonly-used V-statistics and U-statistics, as well as several forms of the more computationally-efficient incomplete U-statistics. The importance of the choice of kernel bandwidth is stressed, showing how it affects the behaviour of the discrepancy estimation. Adaptive estimators are introduced, which combine multiple estimators with various kernels, addressing the problem of kernel selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial uses. However, their deployment in safety-critical applications is hindered by the inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal Prediction, a post-hoc predictive uncertainty quantification procedure with statistical guarantees that are valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or data distribution. Our contribution is manifold. First, we formally define the problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD). We introduce a novel method, Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical guarantees of Conformal Risk Control to two sequential tasks with two parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we present old and new loss functions and prediction sets suited to applying SeqCRC to different cases and certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit for replication and further exploration of our method. Using this toolkit, we perform extensive experiments that validate our approach and emphasize trade-offs and other practical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the utility of EHR data for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Rates between Stochastic and Adversarial Online Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic and adversarial data are two widely studied settings in online learning. But many optimization tasks are neither i.i.d. nor fully adversarial, which makes it of fundamental interest to get a better theoretical understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d. assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were previously considered in the related expert and bandit settings. In the fully i.i.d. case, our regret bounds match the rates one would expect from results in stochastic acceleration, and we also recover the optimal stochastically accelerated rates via online-to-batch conversion. In the fully adversarial case our bounds gracefully deteriorate to match the minimax regret. We further provide lower bounds showing that our regret upper bounds are tight for all intermediate regimes in terms of the stochastic variance and the adversarial variation of the loss gradients.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction can be used as a surrogate model for high-dimensional forward uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to construct a stochastic surrogate model from the results of dimensionality reduction in forward uncertainty quantification. The hypothesis is that the high-dimensional input augmented by the output of a computational model admits a low-dimensional representation. This assumption can be met by numerous uncertainty quantification applications with physics-based computational models. The proposed approach differs from a sequential application of dimensionality reduction followed by surrogate modeling, as we "extract" a surrogate model from the results of dimensionality reduction in the input-output space. This feature becomes desirable when the input space is genuinely high-dimensional. The proposed method also diverges from the Probabilistic Learning on Manifold, as a reconstruction mapping from the feature space to the input-output space is circumvented. The final product of the proposed method is a stochastic simulator that propagates a deterministic input into a stochastic output, preserving the convenience of a sequential "dimensionality reduction + Gaussian process regression" approach while overcoming some of its limitations. The proposed method is demonstrated through two uncertainty quantification problems characterized by high-dimensional input uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach for optimal control of nonlinear control-affine systems represented by a stochastic diffusion. The focus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost functions are unknown, while only a control penalty function and constraints are provided. To this end, we embed state probability densities into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to leverage recent advances in operator regression, thereby identifying Markov transition operators associated with controlled diffusion processes. This operator learning approach integrates naturally with convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions that scale linearly with state dimensionality, effectively solving a wide range of nonlinear optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate its ability to address diverse nonlinear control tasks, including the depth regulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle.</description>

      <title>Swing-by Dynamics in Concept Learning and Compositional Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Linearly Structured f-Divergence Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) is proposed to learn policies robust to dynamics shifts by adding regularization to the transition dynamics in the value function. Existing methods mostly use unstructured regularization, potentially leading to conservative policies under unrealistic transitions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear RRMDP ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces latent structures into both transition kernels and regularization. We focus on offline reinforcement learning, where an agent learns policies from a precollected dataset in the nominal environment. We develop the Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI) algorithm that employs linear function approximation for robust policy learning in $d$-RRMDPs with $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, demonstrating that these bounds are influenced by how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. We establish information-theoretic lower bounds to verify that our algorithm is near-optimal. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Challenges learning from imbalanced data using tree-based models: Prevalence estimates systematically depend on hyperparameters and can be upwardly biased</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using machine learning for imbalanced binary classification problems, it is common to subsample the majority class to create a (more) balanced training dataset. This biases the model's predictions because the model learns from data whose data generating process differs from new data. One way of accounting for this bias is analytically mapping the resulting predictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class. We show that calibrating a random forest this way has negative consequences, including prevalence estimates that depend on both the number of predictors considered at each split in the random forest and the sampling rate used. We explain the former using known properties of random forests and analytical calibration. Through investigating the latter issue, we made a surprising discovery - contrary to the widespread belief that decision trees are biased towards the majority class, they actually can be biased towards the minority class.</description>

      <title>Qini Curve Estimation under Clustered Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qini curves are a widely used tool for assessing treatment policies under allocation constraints as they visualize the incremental gain of a new treatment policy versus the cost of its implementation. Standard Qini curve estimation assumes no interference between units: that is, that treating one unit does not influence the outcome of any other unit. In many real-life applications such as public policy or marketing, however, the presence of interference is common. Ignoring interference in these scenarios can lead to systematically biased Qini curves that over- or under-estimate a treatment policy's cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we address the problem of Qini curve estimation under clustered network interference, where interfering units form independent clusters. We propose a formal description of the problem setting with an experimental study design under which we can account for clustered network interference. Within this framework, we describe three estimation strategies, each suited to different conditions, and provide guidance for selecting the most appropriate approach by highlighting the inherent bias-variance trade-offs. To complement our theoretical analysis, we introduce a marketplace simulator that replicates clustered network interference in a typical e-commerce environment, allowing us to evaluate and compare the proposed strategies in practice.</description>

      <title>Kernel conditional tests from learning-theoretic bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for hypothesis testing on conditional probability distributions, which we then use to construct statistical tests of functionals of conditional distributions. These tests identify the inputs where the functionals differ with high probability, and include tests of conditional moments or two-sample tests. Our key idea is to transform confidence bounds of a learning method into a test of conditional expectations. We instantiate this principle for kernel ridge regression (KRR) with subgaussian noise. An intermediate data embedding then enables more general tests -- including conditional two-sample tests -- via kernel mean embeddings of distributions. To have guarantees in this setting, we generalize existing pointwise-in-time or time-uniform confidence bounds for KRR to previously-inaccessible yet essential cases such as infinite-dimensional outputs with non-trace-class kernels. These bounds also circumvent the need for independent data, allowing for instance online sampling. To make our tests readily applicable in practice, we introduce bootstrapping schemes leveraging the parametric form of testing thresholds identified in theory to avoid tuning inaccessible parameters. We illustrate the tests on examples, including one in process monitoring and comparison of dynamical systems. Overall, our results establish a comprehensive foundation for conditional testing on functionals, from theoretical guarantees to an algorithmic implementation, and advance the state of the art on confidence bounds for vector-valued least squares estimation.</description>

      <title>Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Spectral Fuzzy Clustering of Multivariate Time Series with Applications to Electroencephalogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering multivariate time series (MTS) is challenging due to non-stationary cross-dependencies, noise contamination, and gradual or overlapping state boundaries. We introduce a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain that leverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence to extract frequency-specific monotonic relationships across variables. Our method takes advantage of dominant frequency-based cross-regional connectivity patterns to improve clustering accuracy while remaining resilient to outliers, making the approach broadly applicable to noisy, high-dimensional MTS. Each series is projected onto vectors generated from a spectral matrix specifically tailored to capture the underlying fuzzy partitions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods. As a flagship application, we analyze electroencephalogram recordings, where our approach uncovers frequency- and connectivity-specific markers of latent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness, revealing discriminative patterns and ambiguous transitions.</description>

      <title>Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Based Smooth Policy Regularisation for Reinforcement Learning with Few Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous, uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at https://github.com/YujieZhu7/SPReD.</description>

      <title>Demystifying MaskGIT Sampler and Beyond: Adaptive Order Selection in Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Stochastic Learning and Inference in Overidentified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models), a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence. It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further develop an optional second-order refinement achieving full-sample GMM efficiency and inference procedures based on random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning. In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear demand system with 576 moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.</description>

      <title>TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</description>
