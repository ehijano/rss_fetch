      <title>About almost covering subsets of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>The Lower Bound for Number of Hexagons in Strongly Regular Graphs with Parameters $\lambda=1$ and $\mu=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of $srg(99,14,1,2)$ has been a question of interest for several decades to the moment. In this paper we consider the structural properties in general for the family of strongly regular graphs with parameters $\lambda =1$ and $\mu =2$. In particular, we establish the lower bound for the number of hexagons and, by doing that, we show the connection between the existence of the aforementioned graph and the number of its hexagons.</description>

      <title>S-Glued sums of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many equation-theoretical questions about modular lattices, Hall and Dilworth give a useful construction: Let $L_0$ be a lattice with largest element $u_0$, $L_1$ be a lattice disjoint from $L_0$ with smallest element $v_1$, and $a \in L_0$, $b \in L_1$ such that the intervals $[a, u_0]$ and $[v_1, b]$ are isomorphic. Then, after identifying those intervals you obtain $L_0 \cup L_1$, a lattice structure whose partial order is the transitive relation generated by the partial orders of $L_0$ and $L_1$. It is modular if $L_0$ and $L_1$ are modular. Since in this construction the index set $\{0, 1\}$ is essentially a chain, this work presents a method -- termed S-glued -- whereby a general family $L_x\ (x \in S)$ of lattices can specify a lattice with the small-scale lattice structure determined by the $L_x$ and the large-scale structure determined by $S$. A crucial application is representing finite-length modular lattices using projective geometries.</description>

      <title>Almost regular subgraphs under spectral radius constrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called $K$-almost regular if its maximum degree is at most $K$ times the minimum degree. Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits showed that for a constant $0&lt; \varepsilon&lt; 1$ and a sufficiently large integer $n$, any $n$-vertex graph with more than $n^{1+\varepsilon}$ edges has a $K$-almost regular subgraph with $n'\geq n^{\varepsilon\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+\varepsilon}}$ vertices and at least $\frac{2}{5}n'^{1+\varepsilon}$ edges. An interesting and natural problem is whether there exits the spectral counterpart to Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits's result. In this paper, we will completely settle this issue. More precisely, we verify that for constants $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\varepsilon\leq 1$ and $c&gt;0$, if the spectral radius of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is at least $cn^{\varepsilon}$, then $G$ has a $K$-almost regular subgraph of order $n'\geq n^{\frac{2\varepsilon^2-\varepsilon}{24}}$ with at least $ c'n'^{1+\varepsilon}$ edges, where $c'$ and $K$ are constants depending on $c$ and $\varepsilon$. Moreover, for $0&lt;\varepsilon\leq\frac{1}{2}$, there exist $n$-vertex graphs with spectral radius at least $cn^{\varepsilon}$ that do not contain such an almost regular subgraph. Our result has a wide range of applications in spectral Tur\'{a}n-type problems. Specifically, let $ex(n,\mathcal{H})$ and $spex(n,\mathcal{H})$ denote, respectively, the maximum number of edges and the maximum spectral radius among all $n$-vertex $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs. We show that for $1\geq\xi &gt; \frac{1}{2}$, $ex(n,\mathcal{H}) = O(n^{1+\xi})$ if and only if $spex(n,\mathcal{H}) = O(n^\xi)$.</description>

      <title>Embedding arbitrary edge-colorings of hypergraphs into regular colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\textbf{r}=(r_1,\ldots,r_k)$, an $\textbf{r}$-factorization of the complete $\lambda$-fold $h$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraph $\lambda K_n^h$ is a partition of the edges of $\lambda K_n^h$ into $F_1,\ldots, F_k$ such that $F_j$ is $r_j$-regular and spanning for $1\leq j\leq k$. This paper shows that for $n&gt;\frac{m-1}{1-2^{\frac{1}{1-h}}}+h-1$, a partial $\textbf{r}$-factorization of $\lambda K_m^h$ can be extended to an $\textbf{r}$-factorization of $\lambda K_n^h$ if and only if the obvious necessary conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>A Galois structure on the orbit of large steps walks in the quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enumeration of weighted walks in the quarter plane reduces to studying a functional equation with two catalytic variables. When the steps of the walk are small, Bousquet-M\'elou and Mishna defined a group called the group of the walk which turned out to be crucial in the classification of the small steps models. In particular, its action on the catalytic variables provides a convenient set of changes of variables in the functional equation. This particular set called the orbit has been generalized to models with arbitrary large steps by Bostan, Bousquet-M\'elou and Melczer (BBMM). However, the orbit had till now no underlying group.
  In this article, we endow the orbit with the action of a Galois group, which extends the notion of the group of the walk to models with large steps. As an application, we look into a general strategy to prove the algebraicity of models with small backwards steps, which uses the fundamental objects that are invariants and decoupling. The group action on the orbit allows us to develop a Galoisian approach to these two notions. Up to the knowledge of the finiteness of the orbit, this gives systematic procedures to test their existence and construct them. Our constructions lead to the first proofs of algebraicity of weighted models with large steps, proving in particular a conjecture of BBMM, and allowing to find new algebraic models with large steps.</description>

Abstract: We examine bicoset digraphs and their natural properties from the point of view of symmetry. We then consider connected bicoset digraphs that are $X$-joins with collections of empty graphs, and show that their automorphism groups can be obtained from their natural irreducible quotients. We then show that such digraphs can be recognized from their connection sets.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Combinatorics of Finite Classical Polar Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar spaces over finite fields are fundamental in combinatorial geometry. The concept of polar space was firstly introduced by F. Veldkamp who gave a system of 10 axioms in the spirit of Universal Algebra. Later the axioms were simplified by J. Tits, who introduced the concept of subspaces. Later on, from the point of view of incidence geometry, axioms of polar spaces were also given by F. Buekenhout and E. Shult in 1974. The reader can find the three systems of axioms of polar spaces in Appendix A. Examples of polar spaces are the so called Finite classical polar spaces, i.e. incidence structures arising from quadrics, symplectic forms and Hermitian forms, which are in correspondance with reflexive sesquilinear forms.It is still an open problem to show whether or not classical polar spaces are the only example of finite polar spaces.
  Nowadays, some research problems related to finite classical polar space are: existence of spreads and ovoids; existence of regular systems and $m$-ovoids; upper or lower bounds on partial spreads and partial ovoids. Moreover, polar spaces are in relation with combinatorial objects as regular graphs, block designs and association schemes.
  In this Ph.D. Thesis we investigate the geometry of finite classical polar spaces, giving contributions to the above problems. The thesis is organized as follows. Part I is more focused on the geometric aspects of polar spaces, while in Part II some combinatorial objects are introduced such as regular graphs, association schemes and combinatorial designs. Finally Appendix B, C and D are dedicated to give more details on, respectively, maximal curves, linear codes and combinatorial designs, giving useful results and definitions.</description>

      <title>The probability that a random graph is even-decomposable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with an even number of edges is called even-decomposable if there is a sequence $V(G)=V_0\supset V_1\supset \dots \supset V_k=\emptyset$ such that for each $i$, $G[V_i]$ has an even number of edges and $V_i\setminus~V_{i+1}$ is an independent set in $G$. The study of this property was initiated recently by Versteegen, motivated by connections to a Ramsey-type problem and questions about graph codes posed by Alon. Resolving a conjecture of Versteegen, we prove that all but an $e^{-\Omega(n^2)}$ proportion of the $n$-vertex graphs with an even number of edges are even-decomposable. Moreover, answering one of his questions, we determine the order of magnitude of the smallest $p=p(n)$ for which the probability that the random graph $G(n,1-p)$ is even-decomposable (conditional on it having an even number of edges) is at least $1/2$.
  We also study the following closely related property. A graph is called even-degenerate if there is an ordering $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n$ of its vertices such that each $v_i$ has an even number of neighbours in the set $\{v_{i+1},\dots,v_n\}$. We prove that all but an $e^{-\Omega(n)}$ proportion of the $n$-vertex graphs with an even number of edges are even-degenerate, which is tight up to the implied constant.</description>

      <title>Sparse graphs with local covering conditions on edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1988, Erd\H{o}s suggested the question of minimizing the number of edges in a connected $n$-vertex graph where every edge is contained in a triangle. Shortly after, Catlin, Grossman, Hobbs, and Lai resolved this in a stronger form. In this paper, we study a natural generalization of the question of Erd\H{o}s in which we replace `triangle' with `clique of order $k$' for ${k\ge 3}$. We completely resolve this generalized question with the characterization of all extremal graphs. Motivated by applications in data science, we also study another generalization of the question of Erd\H{o}s where every edge is required to be in at least $\ell$ triangles for $\ell\ge 2$ instead of only one triangle. We completely resolve this problem for $\ell = 2$.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Facially Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering regions in a map to be adjacent when they have nonempty intersection (as opposed to the traditional view requiring intersection in a linear segment) leads to the concept of a facially complete graph: a plane graph that becomes complete when edges are added between every two vertices that lie on a face. Here we present a complete catalog of facially complete graphs: they fall into seven types. A consequence is that if q is the size of the largest face in a plane graph G that is facially complete, then G has at most Floor[3/2 q] vertices. This bound was known, but our proof is completely different from the 1998 approach of Chen, Grigni, and Papadimitriou. Our method also yields a count of the 2-connected facially complete graphs with n vertices. We also show that if a plane graph has at most two faces of size 4 and no larger face, then the addition of both diagonals to each 4-face leads to a graph that is 5-colorable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let e_k(x_1,...,x_l) be an elementary symmetric polynomial and let mu = (mu_1,...,mu_l) be an integer partition. Define pre_k(mu) to be the partition whose parts are the summands in the evaluation e_k(mu_1,...,mu_l). The study of such partitions was initiated by Ballantine, Beck, and Merca who showed (among other things) that pre_2 is injective as a map on binary partitions of n. In the present work we derive a host of identities involving the sequences which count the number of parts of a given value in the image of pre_2. These include generating functions, explicit expressions, and formulas for forward differences. We generalize some of these to d-ary partitions and explore connections with color partitions. Our techniques include the use of generating functions and bijections on rooted partitions. We end with a list of conjectures and a direction for future research.</description>

Abstract: In previous work, we associated a module $T(i)$ to every segment $i$ of a link diagram $K$ and showed that there is a poset isomorphism between the submodules of $T(i)$ and the Kauffman states of $K$ relative to $i$. In this paper, we show that the posets are distributive lattices and give explicit descriptions of the join irreducibles in both posets. We also prove that the subposet of join irreducible Kauffman states is isomorphic to the poset of the coefficient quiver of $T(i)$.</description>

      <title>Burning game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the burning and cooling processes, the burning game is introduced. The game is played on a graph $G$ by the two players (Burner and Staller) that take turns selecting vertices of $G$ to burn; as in the burning process, burning vertices spread fire to unburned neighbors. Burner aims to burn all vertices of $G$ as quickly as possible, while Staller wants the process to last as long as possible. If both players play optimally, then the number of time steps needed to burn the whole graph $G$ is the game burning number $b_g(G)$ if Burner makes the first move, and the Staller-start game burning number $b_g'(G)$ if Staller starts. In this paper, basic bounds on $b_g(G)$ are given and Continuation Principle is established. Graphs with small game burning numbers are characterized and Nordhaus-Gaddum type results are obtained. An analogue of the burning number conjecture for the burning game is considered and graph products are studied.</description>

      <title>Boolean Functions with Small Approximate Spectral Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$. Green and Sanders' quantitative version of Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets, where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
  We prove that the above statement can be generalized to \emph{approximate} spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</description>

      <title>Conflict-free chromatic index of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable if there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to $E(G)$ such that for every edge $e\in E(G)$, there is a color that is assigned to exactly one edge among the closed neighborhood of $e$. The smallest $k$ such that $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable is called the conflict-free chromatic index of $G$, denoted $\chi'_{CF}(G)$. D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o showed that $2\le\chi'_{CF}(T)\le 3$ for every tree $T$ of size at least two. In this paper, we present an algorithm to determine that the conflict-free chromatic index of a tree without 2-degree vertices is 2 or 3, in time $O(n^3)$. This partially answer a question raised by D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operation on skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ called switching, and also define a class of skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ referred to as modular Eulerian matrices. We then show that these are closely related to the graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at $\ell$-th roots of unity. As an application, we study the point simplicial complexes of skew polynomial algebras at cube roots of unity.</description>

      <title>On denominator conjecture for cluster algebras of finite type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation on denominator conjecture of Fomin and Zelevinsky for cluster algebras via geometric models initialed in \cite{FG22}. In this paper, we confirm the denominator conjecture for cluster algebras of finite type. The new contribution is a proof of this conjecture for cluster algebras of type $\mathbb{D}$ and an algorithm for the exceptional types. For the type $\mathbb{D}$ cases, our approach involves geometric model provided by discs with a puncture. By removing the puncture or changing the puncture to an unmarked boundary component, this also yields an alternative proof for the denominator conjecture of cluster algebras of type $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Maximizing the MST-ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of red and blue points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the MST-ratio is the combined length of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees of red points and of blue points divided by the length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of the union of them. The maximum MST-ratio of a point set is the maximum MST-ratio over all non-trivial colorings of its points by red and blue. We prove that the problem of finding the maximum MST-ratio of a given point set is NP-hard when the dimension is a part of the input. Moreover, we present a $O(n^2)$ running time $3$-approximation algorithm for it. As a part of the proof, we show that in any metric space, the maximum MST-ratio is smaller than $3$. Additionally, we study the average MST-ratio over all colorings of a set of $n$ points. We show that this average is always at least $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and for $n$ random points uniformly distributed in a $d$-dimensional unit cube, the average tends to $\sqrt[d]{2}$ in expectation as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Writing finite simple groups of Lie type as products of subset conjugates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Liebeck-Nikolov-Shalev conjecture [LNS12] asserts that, for any finite simple non-abelian group $G$ and any set $A\subseteq G$ with $|A|\geq 2$, $G$ is the product of at most $N\frac{\log|G|}{\log|A|}$ conjugates of $A$, for some absolute constant $N$.
  For $G$ of Lie type, we prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is some $N_{\varepsilon}$ for which $G$ is the product of at most $N_{\varepsilon}\left(\frac{\log|G|}{\log|A|}\right)^{1+\varepsilon}$ conjugates of either $A$ or $A^{-1}$. For symmetric sets, this improves on results of Liebeck, Nikolov, and Shalev [LNS12] and Gill, Pyber, Short, and Szab\'o [GPSS13].
  During the preparation of this paper, the proof of the Liebeck-Nikolov-Shalev conjecture was completed by Lifshitz [Lif24]. Both papers use [GLPS24] as a starting point. Lifshitz's argument uses heavy machinery from representation theory to complete the conjecture, whereas this paper achieves a more modest result by rather elementary combinatorial arguments.</description>

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1303.5505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the set $Park_n$ of parking functions of size $n$ has received a great deal of attention in algebraic combinatorics. We prove that the action of $S_n$ on $Park_n$ extends to an action of $S_{n+1}$. More precisely, we construct a graded $S_{n+1}$-module $V_n$ such that the restriction of $V_n$ to $S_n$ is isomorphic to $Park_n$. We describe the $S_n$-Frobenius characters of the module $V_n$ in all degrees and describe the $S_{n+1}$-Frobenius characters of $V_n$ in extreme degrees. We give a bivariate generalization $V_n^{(\ell, m)}$ of our module $V_n$ whose representation theory is governed by a bivariate generalization of Dyck paths. A Fuss generalization of our results is a special case of this bivariate generalization.</description>

      <title>Partition Rank and Partition Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a universal approach for applying the partition rank method, an extension of Tao's slice rank polynomial method, to tensors that are not diagonal. This is accomplished by generalizing Naslund's distinctness indicator to what we call a partition indicator. The advantages of partition indicators are two-fold: they diagonalize tensors that are constant when specified sets of variables are equal, and even in more general settings they can often substantially reduce the partition rank as compared to when a distinctness indicator is applied. The key to our discoveries is integrating the partition rank method with M\"{o}bius inversion on the lattice of partitions of a finite set. Through this we unify disparate applications of the partition rank method in the literature. We then use our theory to address a finite field analogue of a question of Erd\H{o}s, thereby generalizing results of Hart and Iosevich and independently Shparlinski. Furthermore we generalize work of Pach, et al. on bounding sizes of sets avoiding right triangles to bounding sizes of sets avoiding right $k$-configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a purely tropical analogue of Donagi's $n$-gonal construction and investigate its combinatorial properties. The input of the construction is a harmonic double cover of an $n$-gonal tropical curve. For $n = 2$ and a dilated double cover, the output is a tower of the same type, and we show that the Prym varieties of the two double covers are dual tropical abelian varieties. For $n=3$ and a free double cover, the output is a tetragonal tropical curve with dilation profile nowhere $(2,2)$ or $(4)$, and we show that the construction can be reversed. Furthermore, the Prym variety of the double cover and the Jacobian of the tetragonal curve are isomorphic as principally polarized tropical abelian varieties. Our main tool is tropical homology theory, and our proofs closely follow the algebraic versions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple bijection between Tamari intervals and the blossoming trees (Poulalhon and Schaeffer, 2006) encoding planar triangulations, using a new meandering representation of such trees. Its specializations to the families of synchronized, Kreweras, new/modern, and infinitely modern intervals give a combinatorial proof of the counting formula for each family. Compared to (Bernardi and Bonichon, 2009), our bijection behaves well with the duality of Tamari intervals, enabling also the counting of self-dual intervals.</description>

Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are generalizations of trees that allow for the modeling of non-tree like evolutionary processes. Split networks give a useful way to construct networks with intuitive distance structures induced from the associated split graph. We explore the polyhedral geometry of distance matrices built from circular split systems which have the added property of being equidistant. We give a characterization of the facet defining inequalities and the extreme rays of the cone of distances that arises from an equidistant network associated to any circular split network. We also explain a connection to the Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope from geometric combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a guessing game, permutation Wordle, in which a guesser attempts to recover a hidden permutation in $S_n$. In each round, the guesser guesses a permutation (using information from previous rounds) and is told which entries of that permutation are correct. We describe a natural guessing strategy, which we believe to be optimal. We show that the number of permutations this strategy solves in $k+1$ rounds is the Eulerian number $A(n,k)$.
  We also describe an extension to suited permutations: the setter chooses a permutation in $S_n$ and also a coloring of $[n]$ using $s$ colors. We generalize our strategy, give a recurrence for the number of suited permutations solved in $k+1$ rounds, and relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers. In the case of two suits, or signed permutations, we also relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers of type B.</description>

      <title>The Tensor as an Informational Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers that can be used to store data, encode a computational relation and represent quantum entanglement. In this sense a tensor can be viewed as valuable resource whose transformation can lead to an understanding of structure in data, computational complexity and quantum information.
  In order to facilitate the understanding of this resource, we propose a family of information-theoretically constructed preorders on tensors, which can be used to compare tensors with each other and to assess the existence of transformations between them. The construction places copies of a given tensor at the edges of a hypergraph and allows transformations at the vertices. A preorder is then induced by the transformations possible in a given growing sequence of hypergraphs. The new family of preorders generalises the asymptotic restriction preorder which Strassen defined in order to study the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.
  We derive general properties of the preorders and their associated asymptotic notions of tensor rank and view recent results on tensor rank non-additivity, tensor networks and algebraic complexity in this unifying frame. We hope that this work will provide a useful vantage point for exploring tensors in applied mathematics, physics and computer science, but also from a purely mathematical point of view.</description>

      <title>A strengthening of McConnel's theorem on permutations over finite fields</title>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $q=p^n$, and $D \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$. A celebrated result of McConnel states that if $D$ is a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_q^*$, and $f:\mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_q$ is a function such that $(f(x)-f(y))/(x-y) \in D$ whenever $x \neq y$, then $f(x)$ necessarily has the form $ax^{p^j}+b$. In this notes, we give a sufficient condition on $D$ to obtain the same conclusion on $f$. In particular, we show that McConnel's theorem extends if $D$ has small doubling.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>
