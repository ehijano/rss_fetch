      <title>Credit Spreads' Term Structure: Stochastic Modeling with CIR++ Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic model for credit spreads. The stochastic approach leverages the diffusion of default intensities via a CIR++ model and is formulated within a risk-neutral probability space. Our research primarily addresses two gaps in the literature. The first is the lack of credit spread models founded on a stochastic basis that enables continuous modeling, as many existing models rely on factorial assumptions. The second is the limited availability of models that directly yield a term structure of credit spreads. An intermediate result of our model is the provision of a term structure for the prices of defaultable bonds. We present the model alongside an innovative, practical, and conservative calibration approach that minimizes the error between historical and theoretical volatilities of default intensities. We demonstrate the robustness of both the model and its calibration process by comparing its behavior to historical credit spread values. Our findings indicate that the model not only produces realistic credit spread term structure curves but also exhibits consistent diffusion over time. Additionally, the model accurately fits the initial term structure of implied survival probabilities and provides an analytical expression for the credit spread of any given maturity at any future time.</description>

      <title>Some asymptotics for short maturity Asian options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the existing methods for pricing Asian options are less efficient in the limit of small maturities and small volatilities. In this paper, we use the large deviations theory for the analysis of short-maturity Asian options. We present a local volatility model for the underlying market that incorporates a jump term in addition to the drift and diffusion terms. We estimate the asymptotics for the out-of-the-money, in-the-money, and at-the-money short-maturity Asian call and put options. Under appropriate assumptions, we show that the asymptotics for out-of-the-money Asian call and put options are governed by rare events. For the at-the-money Asian options, the result is more involved and in that case, we find the upper and lower bounds of the asymptotics of the Asian option price.</description>
