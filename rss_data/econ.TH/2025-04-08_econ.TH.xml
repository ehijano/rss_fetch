      <title>Renewable Natural Resources with Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the world's renewable resources are in decline. Optimal harvests with smooth recruitment is well studied but in recent years, ecologists have concluded that tipping points in recruitment are common. Recruitment with a tipping point has low-fecundity below the tipping point and high-fecundity above. When the incremental value of high-fecundity is sufficiently high, there is a high-fecundity steady-state. This steady-state is stable but in some cases, small perturbations may result in large, temporary reductions in recruitment and harvests. Below the tipping point, a low-fecundity steady-state need not exist. When a low-fecundity steady-state does exist, there is an endogenous tipping (Skiba) point: below, harvests converge to the low-fecundity steady-state and above, an austere harvest policy transitions the renewable resource to high-fecundity recruitment. If there is hysteresis in recruitment, the high steady-state may not be stable. Moreover, if the high-/low-fecundity differential is large then following a downward perturbation, fecundity optimally remains low.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, Single Crossing Property, and Stochastic Choice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a typical model of private information and choice under uncertainty, a decision maker observes a signal, updates her prior beliefs using Bayes rule, and maximizes her expected utility. If the decision maker's utility function satisfies the single crossing property, and the information structure is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio, then the comparative statics exhibit monotonicity with respect to signals. We consider the restrictions placed by this model of signal processing on state conditional stochastic choice data. In particular, we show that this model rationalizes a state conditional stochastic choice dataset if and only if the dataset itself is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio.</description>

      <title>Preferences with Multiple Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a collective decision maker presents a menu of uncertain prospects to her group members, each member's choice depends on their predictions about payoff-relevant states. In reality, however, these members hold different predictions; more precisely, they have different prior beliefs about states and predictions about the information they will receive. In this paper, we develop an axiomatic framework to examine collective decision making under such disagreements. First, we characterize two classes of representations: Bewley multiple learning (BML) representations, which are unanimity rules among predictions, and justifiable multiple learning (JML) representations, where a single prediction has veto power. Furthermore, we characterize a general class of representations called hierarchical multiple learning representations, which includes BML and JML representations as special cases. Finally, motivated by the fact that these representations violate completeness or intransitivity due to multiple predictions, we propose a rationalization procedure for constructing complete and transitive preferences from them.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mechanisms under Unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of efficient mechanisms under asymmetric awareness and information. Unawareness refers to the lack of conception rather than the lack of information. Assuming quasi-linear utilities and private values, we show that we can implement in conditional dominant strategies a social choice function that is utilitarian ex-post efficient when pooling all awareness of all agents without the need of the social planner being fully aware ex-ante. To this end, we develop novel dynamic versions of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms in which types are revealed and subsequently elaborated at endogenous higher awareness levels. We explore how asymmetric awareness affects budget balance and participation constraints. We show that ex-ante unforeseen contingencies are no excuse for deficits. Finally, we propose a modified reverse second price auction for efficient procurement of complex incompletely specified projects.</description>

      <title>Competitive Information Disclosure with Heterogeneous Consumer Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of competitive information design in an oligopoly search market with heterogeneous consumer search costs. A unique class of equilibria -- upper-censorship equilibria -- emerges under intense competition. In equilibrium, firms balance competitive pressure with local monopoly power granted by search frictions. Notably, firms disclose only partial information even as the number of firms approaches infinity. The maximal informativeness of equilibrium decreases under first-order shifts in the search cost distribution, but varies non-monotonically under mean-preserving spreads. The model converges to the full-disclosure benchmark as search frictions vanish, and to the no-disclosure benchmark as search costs become homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Verifiable affirmative action in Chinese high school admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the affirmative action policy in Chinese high school admissions, where high schools reserve a proportion of their quotas for graduates of low-performing middle schools. In line with the tradition of accountability, Chinese policymakers aim to ensure a verifiable allocation of reserved seats. We recognize the verifiability of widely used sequential mechanisms, which allocate reserved and open seats in separate stages. However, these mechanisms suffer from strategic complexity, leading to inefficiency and unfairness in the outcome. We then formalize a concept of verifiability for simultaneous mechanisms, which allocate all seats in one stage. We prove that a mechanism is individually rational, strategy-proof, and verifiable if and only if it is the deferred acceptance mechanism associated with one of two choice rules we characterize. We recommend a specific choice rule and mechanism, and discuss their benefits.</description>

      <title>Network Effects of Tariffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model in which country-specific tariffs shape trade flows, prices, and welfare in a global economy with one homogeneous good. Trade flows form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and tariffs influence not only market outcomes but also the structure of the global trade network. A numerical example illustrates how tariffs may eliminate targeted imports, divert trade flows toward third markets, expose domestic firms to intensified foreign competition abroad, reduce consumer welfare, and ultimately harm the country imposing the tariff.</description>

      <title>Rationalizing dynamic choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analyst observes an agent take a sequence of actions. The analyst does not have access to the agent's information and ponders whether the observed actions could be justified through a rational Bayesian model with a known utility function. We show that the observed actions cannot be justified if and only if there is a single deviation argument that leaves the agent better off, regardless of the information. The result is then extended to allow for distributions over possible action sequences. Four applications are presented: monotonicity of rationalization with risk aversion, a potential rejection of the Bayesian model with observable data, feasible outcomes in dynamic information design, and partial identification of preferences without assumptions on information.</description>

      <title>Understanding EFX Allocations: Counting and Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a popular and important fairness property in the fair allocation of indivisible goods, of which its existence in general is still an open question. In this work, we investigate the problem of determining the minimum number of EFX allocations for a given instance, arguing that this approach may yield valuable insights into the existence and computation of EFX allocations. We focus on restricted instances where the number of goods slightly exceeds the number of agents, and extend our analysis to weighted EFX (WEFX) and a novel variant of EFX for general monotone valuations, termed EFX+. In doing so, we identify the transition threshold for the existence of allocations satisfying these fairness notions. Notably, we resolve open problems regarding WEFX by proving polynomial-time computability under binary additive valuations, and establishing the first constant-factor approximation for two agents.</description>

      <title>Group-Level Imitation May Stabilize Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing cooperation among self-interested individuals presents a fundamental challenge in evolutionary theory and social science. While classical models predict the dominance of defection in social dilemmas, empirical and theoretical studies have identified various mechanisms that promote cooperation, including kin selection, reciprocity, and spatial structure. In this work, we investigate the role of localized imitation in the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation within an optional Public Goods Game (PGG). We introduce a model where individuals belong to distinct groups and adapt their strategies based solely on comparisons within their own group. We identify different dynamical regimes, including stable fixed points, limit cycles, and Rock-Scissors-Paper-type oscillations. Our analysis, grounded in a replicator-type framework, reveals that such group-level imitation can stabilize cooperative behavior, provided that groups are not initially polarized around a single strategy. In other words, restricting imitation to group-level interactions mitigates the destabilizing effects of global competition, providing a potential explanation for the resilience of cooperation in structured populations.</description>

Abstract: We study competitive equilibria in exchange economies when a continuum of goods is conflated into a finite set of commodities. The design of conflation choices affects the allocation of scarce resources among agents, by constraining trading opportunities and shifting competitive pressures. We demonstrate the consequences on relative prices, trading positions, and welfare.</description>

      <title>Bundled School Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel school choice system where schools are grouped into hierarchical bundles and offered to students as options for preference reports. By listing a bundle, a student seeks admission to any school within it without ranking these schools. This approach helps students who struggle to rank schools precisely and expands options on limited preference lists, potentially improving match outcomes. We design a modified deferred acceptance mechanism to handle bundle reports while preserving stability. Laboratory experiments support our theory, showing that well-constructed bundles aligned with student preferences enhance welfare and match rates without compromising fairness. Practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cautious Dual-Self Expected Utility and Weak Uncertainty Aversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty aversion introduced by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) has played a central role in decision theory, but at the same time, many incompatible behaviors have been observed in the real world. In this paper, we consider an axiom that postulates only a minimal degree of uncertainty aversion, and examine its implications in the preferences with the basic structure, called the invariant biseparable preferences. We provide three representation theorems for these preferences. Our main result shows that a decision maker with such a preference evaluates each act by considering two "dual" scenarios and then adopting the worse one as its evaluation in a cautious manner. The other two representations share a structure similar to the main result, which clarifies the key implication of weak uncertainty aversion. Furthermore, we offer another foundation for the main representation in the objective/subjective rationality model and characterizations of extensions of the main representation.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), a variant of the classic RPS game introduced by board game designer Yoshiteru Shinohara. Players compete against a host who always plays rock, so players choose either rock or paper. The twist is that if two or more players choose paper, they are eliminated, and the last remaining player is the winner, creating strategic tension among the players. There exists a unique symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium, in which the probability of choosing paper satisfies the equation $(1-p)^{n-1} + p^{n-1}/n = 1/n$, where $n$ is the number of remaining players. The game also admits a continuum of asymmetric equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the novel setting of joint choices, in which options are vectors with components associated to different dimensions. In this framework, menus are multidimensional, being vectors whose components are one-dimensional menus, that is, nonempty subsets of elements associated to each dimension. We provide a natural notion of separability, requiring that selections from some dimensions are never affected by those performed on the remaining dimensions. Stability of separability across dimensions is throughly investigated. Moreover, we analyze rationalizable joint choices, which are those explained by the maximization of a revealed preference. The interplay between rationalizability e separability of joint choices allows to show that latter extends the classical definition of separability of discrete preference relations, and to assess the consistency of the former across dimensions.</description>
