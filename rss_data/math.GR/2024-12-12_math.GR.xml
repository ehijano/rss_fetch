      <title>Relative hyperbolicity of ascending HNN extension of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a finitely generated group G with a free factor system and an injective endomorphism that preserves the free factor system, the ascending HNN extension of G is hyperbolic relative to a collection of maximal parabolic subgroups. As a corollary, we see that if an injective endomorphism of a finite rank free group F is exponentially growing, the ascending HNN extension of F is relatively hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Product separability for special cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any product of convex subgroups of a virtually special cubulated group is separable. Previously, this was only known for products of three subgroups, or in the case where the group is hyperbolic, or in some other more technical cases with additional assumptions on the subgroups. We also provide an application to the action of a virtually special cubulated group on its contact graph.</description>

      <title>Bireflections of the commutator subgroup of an orthogonal group over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $O(p,q)$ be the orthogonal groups of signature $(p,q)$ over the reals. It is shown that an element of the commutator subgroup $O(p,q)'$ of $O(p,q)$ is bireflectional (product of 2 involutions in $O(p,q)'$) if and only if it is reversible (conjugate to its inverse). Moreover, the bireflectional elements of $O(p, q)'$ are classified.</description>

      <title>On the subgroup membership problem in bounded automata groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the generalised word problem (aka subgroup membership problem) for stabiliser subgroups of groups acting on rooted $d$-regular trees. Stabilisers of infinite rays in the tree are not finitely generated in general, and so the problem is not even well posed unless the infinite ray has a finite description, for example, if the ray is eventually periodic as an infinite word over the alphabet with $d$ letters. We show that for bounded automata groups, the membership problem for such subgroups is solvable by proving that it forms an ET0L language that is constructable. Exploiting this, we give a recursive formula for the associated generating function. We also show that, in general, the membership problem for the stabiliser of an infinite ray in a bounded automata group cannot be described using context-free languages.</description>

      <title>On profinite groups with the Magnus Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group is said to have the Magnus Property (MP) if whenever two elements have the same normal closure then they are conjugate or inverse-conjugate. We show that a profinite MP group $G$ is prosolvable and any quotient of it is again MP. As corollaries we obtain that the only prime divisors of $|G|$ are $2$, $3$, $5$ and $7$, and the second derived subgroup of $G$ is pronilpotent. We also show that the inverse limit of an inverse system of profinite MP groups is again MP. Finally when $G$ is finitely generated, we establish that $G$ must in fact be finite.</description>

      <title>The rapid decay property for pairs of discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of rapid decay property for a group $G$ to pairs of groups $(G,H)$ where $H$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $G$, where typically the subgroup $H$ does not have rapid decay. We deduce some isomorphisms in $K$-theory, and investigate relatively spectral injections in the reduced group $C^*$-algebra. Rapid decay property for the pair $(G,H)$ also gives a lower bound for the probability of return to $H$ of symmetric random walks on $G$.</description>

      <title>Groups of order 64 and non-homeomorphic double Kodaira fibrations with the same biregular invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate finite, non-abelian quotients $G$ of the pure braid group on two strands $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)$, where $\Sigma_b$ is a closed Riemann surface of genus $b$, which do not factor through $\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b)$. Building on our previous work on some special systems of generators on finite groups that we called \emph{diagonal double Kodaira structures}, we prove that, if $G$ has not order $32$, then $|G| \geq 64$, and we completely classify the cases where equality holds. In the last section, as a geometric application of our algebraic results, we construct two $3$-dimensional families of double Kodaira fibrations having the same biregular invariants and the same Betti numbers but different fundamental group.</description>

      <title>The separating Noether number of small groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separating Noether number of a finite group is the minimal positive integer $d$ such that for any finite dimensional complex linear representation of the group, any two dictinct orbits can be distinguished by a polynomial invariant of degree at most $d$. In the present paper its exact value is determined for all groups of order less than $32$, for all finite groups with a cyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, and for the direct product of a dihedral group with the $2$-element group. The results show in particular that unlike the ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian finite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper direct factor of the group. Most of the results are proved for the case of a general (possibly finite) base field containing an element whose multiplicative order equals the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Representation growth of maximal class groups: various exceptional cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4992</link>
      <description>arXiv:1410.4992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to "Representation growth of maximal class groups: non-exceptional primes". We use a constructive method to calculate some exceptional cases of $p$-local representation zeta functions of a family of finitely generated nilpotent groups $M_n$ with maximal nilpotency class. Using the machinery of the constructive method from the prequel paper we construct all irreducible representations of degree $p^N$ for all $N\in \mathbb{N}$ for the group $M_{p+1}$ for a fixed prime $p$. We also construct all irreducible representations of degree $2^N$ for the group $M_4$. Together with the main result from the prequel, this gives us a complete understanding of the irreducible representations of the groups $M_3$ and $M_4$, along with their global representation zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Invariance of non-vanishing of first $l^p$-cohomology under $L^q$-Measured Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.05991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first $l^p$-cohomology is an algebro-analytical object attached to a finitely generated discrete group and introduced by M. Gromov. It is well known that it is invariant under quasi-isometry. In this article, we prove that the non-vanishing of the first $l^p$-cohomology of a non-amenable group is invariant under $L^q$-Measured Equiavalence (an equivalence relation introduced by Gromov), where $q\geq p$. We also discuss many applications of this result. We prove that for hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) Coxeter groups with boundaries having Combinatorial Loewner Property, conformal dimension (of the canonical conformal gauge) of the Gromov boundary is invariant under $L^q$-Measured Equivalence for some large $q$. We prove that the finitely generated free groups and surface groups are not $L^1$-Measured Equivalent. We also give a lower bound of the critical exponent for the first $l^p$-cohomology of any lattice in $SO(n,1)$. Finally, we discuss $L^q$-Measured Equivalence between non-amenable 3-manifold groups corresponding to Thurston's three geometries $\mathbb{H}^3$, $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\widetilde{SL_2(\mathbb{R})}$.</description>
