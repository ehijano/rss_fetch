      <title>Building and Evaluating a Realistic Virtual World for Large Scale Urban Exploration from 360{\deg} Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to build realistic virtual worlds, called 360RVW, for large urban environments directly from 360{\deg} videos. We provide an interface for interactive exploration, where users can freely navigate via their own avatars. 360{\deg} videos record the entire environment of the shooting location simultaneously leading to highly realistic and immersive representations. Our system uses 360{\deg} videos recorded along streets and builds a 360RVW through four main operations: video segmentation by intersection detection, video completion to remove the videographer, semantic segmentation for virtual collision detection with the avatar, and projection onto a distorted sphere that moves along the camera trajectory following the avatar's movements. Our interface allows users to explore large urban environments by changing their walking direction at intersections or choosing a new location by clicking on a map. Even without a 3D model, the users can experience collision with buildings using metadata produced by semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we stream the 360{\deg} videos so users can directly access 360RVW via their web browser. We fully evaluate our system, including a perceptual experiment comparing our approach to previous exploratory interfaces. The results confirm the quality of our system, especially regarding the presence of users and the interactive exploration, making it most suitable for a virtual tour of urban environments.</description>

      <title>SyncLipMAE: Contrastive Masked Pretraining for Audio-Visual Talking-Face Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii) visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Embodied Space Experience through Umbilical Interaction: A Grounded Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critiques the limits of human-centered design in HCI, proposing a shift toward Interface-Centered Design. Drawing on Hookway's philosophy of interfaces, phenomenology, and embodied interaction, we created Umbilink, an umbilical interaction device simulating a uterine environment with tactile sensors and rhythmic feedback to induce a pre-subjectivized state of sensory reduction. Participants' experiences were captured through semi-structured interviews and analyzed with grounded theory. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the novel interface type of Umbilical Interaction; (2) demonstrating the cognitive value of materialized interfaces in a human-interface-environment relation; (3) highlighting the design role of wearing rituals as liminal experiences. As a pilot study, this design suggests imaginative applications in healing, meditation, and sleep, while offering a speculative tool for future interface research.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression: A Prior-Guided Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.</description>

      <title>MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The journal preprint version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.</description>

      <title>JND-Guided Light-Weight Neural Pre-Filter for Perceptual Image Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.</description>

      <title>Connecting Giants: Synergistic Knowledge Transfer of Large Multimodal Models for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces, transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CoPRS: Learning Positional Prior from Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text, which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation. Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation. Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by reasoning and predicting masks more precisely.

      <title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Misinformation Recognition with Incomplete Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Recognition has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of misinformation recognition in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation.

      <title>SMC++: Masked Learning of Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \textit{Codes and model are available at: https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach towards image authentication and tampering detection by using watermarking as a communication channel for semantic information. We modify the HiDDeN deep-learning watermarking architecture to embed and extract high-dimensional real vectors representing image captions. Our method improves significantly robustness on both malign and benign edits. We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Position-Aware View Synthesis from Single-View Input</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in view synthesis have significantly enhanced immersive experiences across various computer graphics and multimedia applications, including telepresence and entertainment. By enabling the generation of new perspectives from a single input view, view synthesis allows users to better perceive and interact with their environment. However, many state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high visual quality, face limitations in real-time performance, which makes them less suitable for live applications where low latency is critical. In this paper, we present a lightweight, position-aware network designed for real-time view synthesis from a single input image and a target camera pose. The proposed framework consists of a Position Aware Embedding, which efficiently maps positional information from the target pose to generate high dimensional feature maps. These feature maps, along with the input image, are fed into a Rendering Network that merges features from dual encoder branches to resolve both high and low level details, producing a realistic new view of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior efficiency and visual quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex translational movements without explicit geometric operations like warping. This work marks a step toward enabling real-time live and interactive telepresence applications.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181</link>

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.</description>

      <title>Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression</title>

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.</description>

      <title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Tailored Teaching with Balanced Difficulty: Elevating Reasoning in Multimodal Chain-of-Thought via Prompt Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</description>
