      <title>Residual Multi-Task Learner for Applied Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms rely heavily on modeling diverse user feedback to provide personalized services. Consequently, multi-task learning has become an integral part of their ranking systems. However, existing multi-task learning methods encounter two main challenges: some lack explicit modeling of task relationships, resulting in inferior performance, while others have limited applicability due to being computationally intensive, having scalability issues, or relying on strong assumptions. To address these limitations and better fit our real-world scenario, pre-rank in Shopee Search, we introduce in this paper ResFlow, a lightweight multi-task learning framework that enables efficient cross-task information sharing via residual connections between corresponding layers of task networks. Extensive experiments on datasets from various scenarios and modalities demonstrate its superior performance and adaptability over state-of-the-art methods. The online A/B tests in Shopee Search showcase its practical value in large-scale industrial applications, evidenced by a 1.29% increase in OPU (order-per-user) without additional system latency. ResFlow is now fully deployed in the pre-rank module of Shopee Search. To facilitate efficient online deployment, we propose a novel offline metric Weighted Recall@K, which aligns well with our online metric OPU, addressing the longstanding online-offline metric misalignment issue. Besides, we propose to fuse scores from the multiple tasks additively when ranking items, which outperforms traditional multiplicative fusion.

      <title>InterFormer: Towards Effective Heterogeneous Interaction Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards unearthing neglected climate innovations from scientific literature using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change poses an urgent global threat, needing the rapid identification and deployment of innovative solutions. We hypothesise that many of these solutions already exist within scientific literature but remain underutilised. To address this gap, this study employs a curated dataset sourced from OpenAlex, a comprehensive repository of scientific papers. Utilising Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4-o from OpenAI, we evaluate title-abstract pairs from scientific papers on seven dimensions, covering climate change mitigation potential, stage of technological development, and readiness for deployment. The outputs of the language models are then compared with human evaluations to assess their effectiveness in identifying promising yet overlooked climate innovations. Our findings suggest that these LLM-based models can effectively augment human expertise, uncovering climate solutions that are potentially impactful but with far greater speed, throughput and consistency. Here, we focused on UK-based solutions, but the workflow is region-agnostic. This work contributes to the discovery of neglected innovations in scientific literature and demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing climate action strategies.</description>

      <title>KuaiFormer: Transformer-Based Retrieval at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale content recommendation systems, retrieval serves as the initial stage in the pipeline, responsible for selecting thousands of candidate items from billions of options to pass on to ranking modules. Traditionally, the dominant retrieval method has been Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) dual-tower structure. However, applying transformer in retrieval tasks has been the focus of recent research, though real-world industrial deployment still presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce KuaiFormer, a novel transformer-based retrieval framework deployed in a large-scale content recommendation system. KuaiFormer fundamentally redefines the retrieval process by shifting from conventional score estimation tasks (such as click-through rate estimate) to a transformer-driven Next Action Prediction paradigm. This shift enables more effective real-time interest acquisition and multi-interest extraction, significantly enhancing retrieval performance. KuaiFormer has been successfully integrated into Kuaishou App's short-video recommendation system since May 2024, serving over 400 million daily active users and resulting in a marked increase in average daily usage time of Kuaishou users. We provide insights into both the technical and business aspects of deploying transformer in large-scale recommendation systems, addressing practical challenges encountered during industrial implementation. Our findings offer valuable guidance for engineers and researchers aiming to leverage transformer models to optimize large-scale content recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Establishing and Evaluating Trustworthy AI: Overview and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (re-)shape modern life, driving innovation in a wide range of sectors. However, some AI systems have yielded unexpected or undesirable outcomes or have been used in questionable manners. As a result, there has been a surge in public and academic discussions about aspects that AI systems must fulfill to be considered trustworthy. In this paper, we synthesize existing conceptualizations of trustworthy AI along six requirements: 1) human agency and oversight, 2) fairness and non-discrimination, 3) transparency and explainability, 4) robustness and accuracy, 5) privacy and security, and 6) accountability. For each one, we provide a definition, describe how it can be established and evaluated, and discuss requirement-specific research challenges. Finally, we conclude this analysis by identifying overarching research challenges across the requirements with respect to 1) interdisciplinary research, 2) conceptual clarity, 3) context-dependency, 4) dynamics in evolving systems, and 5) investigations in real-world contexts. Thus, this paper synthesizes and consolidates a wide-ranging and active discussion currently taking place in various academic sub-communities and public forums. It aims to serve as a reference for a broad audience and as a basis for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Entropy and type-token ratio in gigaword corpora</title>

Abstract: Lexical diversity measures the vocabulary variation in texts. While its utility is evident for analyses in language change and applied linguistics, it is not yet clear how to operationalize this concept in a unique way. We here investigate entropy and text-token ratio, two widely employed metrics for lexical diversities, in six massive linguistic datasets in English, Spanish, and Turkish, consisting of books, news articles, and tweets. These gigaword corpora correspond to languages with distinct morphological features and differ in registers and genres, thus constituting a diverse testbed for a quantitative approach to lexical diversity. Strikingly, we find a functional relation between entropy and text-token ratio that holds across the corpora under consideration. Further, in the limit of large vocabularies we find an analytical expression that sheds light on the origin of this relation and its connection with both Zipf and Heaps laws. Our results then contribute to the theoretical understanding of text structure and offer practical implications for fields like natural language processing.</description>

      <title>LLM-assisted Explicit and Implicit Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-interest modeling in current recommender systems (RS) is mainly based on user behavioral data, capturing user interest preferences from multiple dimensions. However, since behavioral data is implicit and often highly sparse, it is challenging to understand users' complex and diverse interests. Recent studies have shown that the rich semantic information in the text can effectively supplement the deficiencies of behavioral data. Despite this, it is still difficult for small models to directly extract semantic features associated with users' deep interests. That is, how to effectively align semantics with behavioral information to form a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of user interests has become a critical research problem. To address this, we propose an LLM-assisted explicit and implicit multi-interest learning framework (named EIMF) to model user interests on two levels: behavior and semantics. The framework consists of two parts: Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM) and Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM). The traditional multi-interest RS model in IBIM can learn users' implicit behavioral interests from interactions with items. In ESIM, we first adopt a clustering algorithm to select typical samples and design a prompting strategy on LLM to obtain explicit semantic interests. Furthermore, in the training phase, the semantic interests of typical samples can enhance the representation learning of behavioral interests based on the multi-task learning on semantic prediction and modality alignment. Therefore, in the inference stage, accurate recommendations can be achieved with only the user's behavioral data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EIMF framework, which effectively and efficiently combines small models with LLM to improve the accuracy of multi-interest modeling.</description>

      <title>A Dual Adaptive Assignment Approach for Robust Graph-Based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is an essential aspect of network analysis that involves grouping nodes into separate clusters. Recent developments in deep learning have resulted in advanced deep graph clustering techniques, which have proven effective in many applications. Nonetheless, these methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with the complexities of real-world graphs, particularly in the presence of noisy edges. Additionally, many denoising graph clustering strategies tend to suffer from lower performance compared to their non-denoised counterparts, training instability, and challenges in scaling to large datasets. To tackle these issues, we introduce a new framework called the Dual Adaptive Assignment Approach for Robust Graph-Based Clustering (RDSA). RDSA consists of three key components: (i) a node embedding module that effectively integrates the graph's topological features and node attributes; (ii) a structure-based soft assignment module that improves graph modularity by utilizing an affinity matrix for node assignments; and (iii) a node-based soft assignment module that identifies community landmarks and refines node assignments to enhance the model's robustness. We assess RDSA on various real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings indicate that RDSA provides robust clustering across different graph types, excelling in clustering effectiveness and robustness, including adaptability to noise, stability, and scalability.</description>
