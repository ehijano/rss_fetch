      <title>Quantitative analysis of cell size control mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell size control is crucial for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis. In this study, we develop a first-order partial differential equation model to examine the effects of three key size control mechanisms: the sizer, timer, and adder. Each mechanism is incorporated into the model through distinct boundary conditions. Exact solutions for these mechanisms are derived using the method of characteristics, allowing us to explore how the steady-state size distribution depends on control parameters. Additionally, individual-cell-based stochastic simulations are performed to validate our theoretical findings and investigate the size distribution under various conditions. This study provides new insights into the quantitative dynamics of cell size regulation, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and laying the groundwork for future theoretical and experimental work on size homeostasis in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis-guided model reduction of a mathematical model of pembrolizumab therapy for de novo metastatic MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults under 55, involving a complex interplay of biological processes such as dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration, T cell activation and proliferation, cytokine production, and T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cancer cell killing. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC constitute 15% of all CRC, and 4% of metastatic CRC, and exhibit remarkable responsiveness to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Mathematical models of the underlying immunobiology and the interactions underpinning immune checkpoint blockade offer mechanistic insights into tumour-immune dynamics and provide avenues for treatment optimisation and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We used our data-driven model of de novo metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC (dnmMCRC) and performed sensitivity analysis-guided model reduction using the FAST and EFAST methods. In this work, we constructed two simplified models of dnmMCRC: one that faithfully reproduces all of the original model's trajectories, and a second, minimal model that accurately replicates the original dynamics while being highly extensible for future inclusion of additional components to explore various aspects of the anti-tumour immune response.</description>
