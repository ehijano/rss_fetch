      <title>A New Underdetermined Framework for Sparse Estimation of Fault Location for Transmission Lines Using Limited Current Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes an alternative underdetermined framework for fault location that utilizes current measurements along with the branch-bus matrix, providing another option besides the traditional voltage-based methods. To enhance fault location accuracy in the presence of multiple outliers, the robust YALL1 algorithm is used to resist outlier interference and accurately recover the sparse vector, thereby pinpointing the fault precisely. The results on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Development of an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller using Neural Networks for Trajectory Tracking of a Cylindrical Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cylindrical manipulators are extensively used in industrial automation, especially in emerging technologies like 3D printing, which represents a significant future trend. However, controlling the trajectory of nonlinear models with system uncertainties remains a critical challenge, often leading to reduced accuracy and reliability. To address this, the study develops an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) integrated with Neural Networks (NNs) to improve trajectory tracking for cylindrical manipulators. The ASMC leverages the robustness of sliding mode control and the adaptability of neural networks to handle uncertainties and dynamic variations effectively. Simulation results validate that the proposed ASMC-NN achieves high trajectory tracking accuracy, fast response time, and enhanced reliability, making it a promising solution for applications in 3D printing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Optimize the parameters of the PID Controller using Genetic Algorithm for Robot Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with optimized parameters for a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize the controller parameters, addressing the challenges in determining PID controller parameters for highly nonlinear systems like robotic arms compared to traditional methods. The GA-optimized PID controller significantly improves control accuracy and performance over traditional control methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the robotic arm system operates with high precision and stability. Additionally, the shortened trajectory tracking response time enhances the feasibility of applying this control algorithm in realworld scenarios. This research not only confirms the suitability of PID-GA for robotic arms and similar systems but also opens new avenues for applying this algorithm to real physical systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Observer Design for LuGre Friction Estimation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic components of the friction may directly impact the stability and performance of the motion control systems. The LuGre model is a prevalent friction model utilized to express this dynamic behavior. Since the LuGre model is very comprehensive, friction compensation based on it might be challenging. Inspired by this, we develop a novel observer to estimate and compensate for LuGre friction. Furthermore, we present a Lyapunov stability analysis to show that observer dynamics are asymptotically stable under certain conditions. Compared to its counterparts, the proposed observer constitutes a simple and standalone scheme that can be utilized with arbitrary control inputs in a straightforward way. As a primary difference, the presented observer estimates velocity and uses the velocity error to estimate friction in addition to control input. The extensive simulations revealed that the introduced observer enhances position and velocity tracking performance in the presence of friction.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Method for Power System Resilience Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems are critical infrastructure in modern society, and power outages can cause significant disruptions to communities and individuals' daily lives. The resilience of a power system measures its ability to maintain power supply during highly disruptive events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and thunderstorms. Traditional methods for quantifying power system resilience include statistics-based and simulation-based approaches. Statistics-based methods offer a retrospective analysis of system performance without requiring a physical model, while simulation-based methods necessitate detailed physical system information and often simplify real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a deep learning-based method for evaluating power system resilience using historical power outage data. The method leverages the generalization capabilities of deep learning models and incorporates socio-economic and demographic factors as weighting terms to highlight the impacts on vulnerable demographic groups. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two case studies: one with real historical outage data and the other with simulated outage records. This approach provides valuable insights into measuring power system resilience against hazardous weather events without requiring a physical model of the target systems. The evaluation results can further guide the planning of distributed energy resources for resilience enhancement.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Medium-Term Planning of Renewable-Integrated Self-Scheduling Cascaded Hydropower to Guide Wholesale Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For self-scheduling cascaded hydropower (S-CHP) facilities, medium-term planning is a critical step that coordinates water availability over the medium-term horizon, providing water usage guidance for their short-term operations in wholesale market participation. Typically, medium-term planning strategies (e.g., reservoir storage targets at the end of each short-term period) are determined by either optimization methods or rules of thumb. However, with the integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs), optimization-based methods suffer from deviations between the anticipated and actual reservoir storage, while rules of thumb could be financially conservative, thereby compromising short-term operating profitability in wholesale market participation. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework to derive medium-term planning policies for VRES-integrated S-CHPs (VS-CHPs), which can leverage contextual information underneath individual short-term periods and train planning policies by their induced short-term operating profits in wholesale market participation. The proposed DRL-based framework offers two practical merits. First, its planning strategies consider both seasonal requirements of reservoir storage and needs for short-term operating profits. Second, it adopts a multi-parametric programming-based strategy to accelerate the expensive training process associated with multi-step short-term operations. Finally, the DRL-based framework is evaluated on a real-world VS-CHP, demonstrating its advantages over current practice.</description>

      <title>Promoting Shared Energy Storage Aggregation among High Price-Tolerance Prosumer: An Incentive Deposit and Withdrawal Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household electricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the household electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for saving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy Storage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage in SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take additional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices, which happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not possess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to participate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does not require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain existing energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation of SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction step during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the energy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal services (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more electricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a matching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption behaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients in DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the matching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Control of Deformation and Flight for Morphing Aircraft via Meta-Learning and Coupled State-Dependent Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the coordinated control problem of deformation and flight for morphing aircraft (MA) is studied by using meta-learning (ML) and coupled state-dependent Riccati equations (CSDREs). Our method is built on two principal observations that dynamic models of MA under varying morphing conditions share a morphing condition independent representation function and that the specific morphing condition part lies in a set of linear coefficients. To that end, the domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML) is employed to learn the shared representation with offline flight data. Based on the learned representation function, the coordinated control of the deformation and flight for MA is formulated as a non-cooperative differential game. The state-dependent feedback control solutions can be derived by addressing a pair of CSDREs. For this purpose, Lyapunov iterations are extended to obtain the positive semidefinite (definite) stabilizing solutions of the CSDREs, and the convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is provided. Finally, a simulation study is carried out to validate the efficacy of the developed coordinated game control strategies.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI based System for Supply Air Temperature Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve the transparency and understanding of predictive models in control of automated supply air temperature (ASAT) of Air Handling Unit (AHU). The study focuses on forecasting of ASAT using a linear regression with Huber loss. However, having only a control curve without semantic and/or physical explanation is often not enough. The present study employs one of the XAI methods: Shapley values, which allows to reveal the reasoning and highlight the contribution of each feature to the final ASAT forecast. In comparison to other XAI methods, Shapley values have solid mathematical background, resulting in interpretation transparency. The study demonstrates the contrastive explanations--slices, for each control value of ASAT, which makes it possible to give the client objective justifications for curve changes.</description>

      <title>Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</description>

      <title>Towards resilient cities: A hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation through data driven decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing a comprehensive view of the city operation and offering useful metrics for decision making is a well known challenge for urban risk analysis systems. Existing systems are, in many cases, generalizations of previous domain specific tools and or methodologies that may not cover all urban interdependencies and makes it difficult to have homogeneous indicators. In order to overcome this limitation while seeking for effective support to decision makers, this article introduces a novel hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation. The framework is built on a proposed city concept that considers urban space as a Complex Adaptive System composed by interconnected Critical Infrastructures. In this concept, a Social System, which models daily patterns and social interactions of the citizens in the Urban Landscape, drives the CIs demand to configure the full city picture. The frameworks hybrid design integrates agent based and network based modeling by breaking down city agents into system dependent subagents, to enable both inter and intra system interaction simulation, respectively. A layered structure of indicators at different aggregation levels is also developed, to ensure that decisions are not only data driven but also explainable. Therefore, the proposed simulation framework can serve as a DSS tool that allows the quantitative analysis of the impact of threats at different levels. First, system level metrics can be used to get a broad view on the city resilience. Then, agent level metrics back those figures and provide better explainability. On implementation, the proposed framework enables component reusability (for eased coding), simulation federation (enabling the integration of existing system oriented simulators), discrete simulation in accelerated time (for rapid scenario simulation) and decision oriented visualization (for informed outputs).</description>

      <title>Traffic Simulations: Multi-City Calibration of Metropolitan Highway Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to perform travel demand calibration for high-resolution stochastic traffic simulators. It employs abundant travel times at the path-level, departing from the standard practice of resorting to scarce segment-level sensor counts. The proposed approach is shown to tackle high-dimensional instances in a sample-efficient way. For the first time, case studies on 6 metropolitan highway networks are carried out, considering a total of 54 calibration scenarios. This is the first work to show the ability of a calibration algorithm to systematically scale across networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm, the proposed approach enhances fit to field data by an average 43.5% with a maximum improvement of 80.0%, and does so within fewer simulation calls.</description>

      <title>Democratic Resilience and Sociotechnical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Models with 1-Bit Measurements: Asymptotics of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the multiple parameter maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) from censored data, where the censoring mechanism is in the form of $1$-bit measurements. The underlying distribution of the uncensored data is assumed to belong to the exponential family, with natural parameters expressed as a linear combination of the predictors, known as generalized linear model (GLM). As part of the analysis, the Fisher information matrix is also derived for both censored and uncensored data, which helps to quantify the impact of censoring and assess the performance of the MLE. The choice of GLM allows one to consider a variety of practical examples where 1-bit estimation is of interest. In particular, it is shown how the derived results can be used to analyze two practically relevant scenarios: the Gaussian model with both unknown mean and variance, and the Poisson model with an unknown mean.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel control framework to address the satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order MIMO nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time. Finally, simulation examples of trajectory and region tracking for a mobile robot validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Configuration and EMT Simulation of the 240-bus MiniWECC System Integrating Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As offshore wind farms (OWFs) become increasingly prevalent in Northern California and Southern Oregon, they introduce faster dynamics into the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system, reshaping its dynamic behavior. Accordingly, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential to assess high frequency dynamics of the WECC system with integrated OWFs. Against this background, this paper presents the integration of detailed dynamic models of OWFs into a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD software. The sequential initialization technique is employed to facilitate the smooth initiation of a large-scale system in an EMT simulation. The performance of the configured model is assessed under wind speed variations and grounded faults, demonstrating the effectiveness of the miniWECC system with OWFs. This system serves as a valuable basic use case for validating the fast dynamic performance of future WECC systems with high penetration of wind energy.</description>

      <title>Systematic interval observer design for linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first propose systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant systems, under standard assumptions involving observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and disturbances. Historically, such designs rely on transformations with certain limitations into a form that is Metzler (for continuous time) or non-negative (for discrete time). We show that they can be effectively replaced with a linear time-invariant transformation that can be easily computed offline. Next, we propose an extension to the time-varying setting, addressing the limitations of conventional transformations that lack guaranteed outcomes. We employ dynamical transformations into higher-dimensional target forms for which an interval observer can always be constructed. These transformations become left-invertible after a certain time, provided observability conditions are met and the target dynamics are sufficiently high-dimensional and fast, thus enabling the reconstruction of bounds in the original coordinates in finite time. Academic examples are presented to illustrate our methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic Planning for the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Orienteering Problem (OP) is a well-studied routing problem that has been extended to incorporate uncertainties, reflecting stochastic or dynamic travel costs, prize-collection costs, and prizes. Existing approaches may, however, be inefficient in real-world applications due to insufficient modeling knowledge and initially unknowable parameters in online scenarios. Thus, we propose the Uncertain and Dynamic Orienteering Problem (UDOP), modeling travel costs as distributions with unknown and time-variant parameters. UDOP also associates uncertain travel costs with dynamic prizes and prize-collection costs for its objective and budget constraints. To address UDOP, we develop an ADaptive Approach for Probabilistic paThs - ADAPT, that iteratively performs 'execution' and 'online planning' based on an initial 'offline' solution. The execution phase updates system status and records online cost observations. The online planner employs a Bayesian approach to adaptively estimate power consumption and optimize path sequence based on safety beliefs. We evaluate ADAPT in a practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) charging scheduling problem for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. The UAV must optimize its path to recharge sensor nodes efficiently while managing its energy under uncertain conditions. ADAPT maintains comparable solution quality and computation time while offering superior robustness. Extensive simulations show that ADAPT achieves a 100% Mission Success Rate (MSR) across all tested scenarios, outperforming comparable heuristic-based and frequentist approaches that fail up to 70% (under challenging conditions) and averaging 67% MSR, respectively. This work advances the field of OP with uncertainties, offering a reliable and efficient approach for real-world applications in uncertain and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term CHP planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on a CHP system of Portland General Electric demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in determining proper carryover storage values to facilitate medium-term CHP planning.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Metrics for Wildfire Ignition Risk from Geographic Data in Power Shutoff Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faults on power lines and other electric equipment are known to cause wildfire ignitions. To mitigate the threat of wildfire ignitions from electric power infrastructure, many utilities preemptively de-energize power lines, which may result in power shutoffs. Data regarding wildfire ignition risks are key inputs for effective planning of power line de-energizations. However, there are multiple ways to formulate risk metrics that spatially aggregate wildfire risk map data, and there are different ways of leveraging this data to make decisions. The key contribution of this paper is to define and compare the results of employing six metrics for quantifying the wildfire ignition risks of power lines from risk maps, considering both threshold- and optimization-based methods for planning power line de-energizations. The numeric results use the California Test System (CATS), a large-scale synthetic grid model with power line corridors accurately representing California infrastructure, in combination with real Wildland Fire Potential Index data for a full year. This is the first application of optimal power shutoff planning on such a large and realistic test case. Our results show that the choice of risk metric significantly impacts the lines that are de-energized and the resulting load shed. We find that the optimization-based method results in significantly less load shed than the threshold-based method while achieving the same risk reduction.</description>

      <title>Equity Impacts of Public Transit Network Redesign with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs (equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas (equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget. Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is explicitly incorporated into the design objective.</description>

      <title>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasiconcave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasiconcave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers' flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Spacecraft Servicing under Partial Feedback using Lyapunov-based Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly applied in space missions, including distributed space systems, resilient constellations, and autonomous rendezvous and docking operations. A critical emerging application is collaborative spacecraft servicing, which encompasses on-orbit maintenance, space debris removal, and swarm-based satellite repositioning. These missions involve servicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft under challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement inaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on assumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are impractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft dynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed state estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position measurements and operates under partial state information. A novel $\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally available information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive controller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming from unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft regulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence of errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of the origin under the trackability condition. The developed method eliminates the need for expensive velocity sensors or extensive pre-training, offering a practical and robust solution for spacecraft servicing in complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis: a control perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1) prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2) that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost) over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori assuming that all time varying parameters are bounded, which for many optimization tasks is not unrealistic, but is a non starter in control applications. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control and ask the following question "Are regret optimal control strategies deployable?"</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Generative Manufacturing Systems (GMS) as a novel approach to effectively manage and coordinate autonomous manufacturing assets, thereby enhancing their responsiveness and flexibility to address a wide array of production objectives and human preferences. Deviating from traditional explicit modeling, GMS employs generative AI, including diffusion models and ChatGPT, for implicit learning from envisioned futures, marking a shift from a model-optimum to a training-sampling decision-making. Through the integration of generative AI, GMS enables complex decision-making through interactive dialogue with humans, allowing manufacturing assets to generate multiple high-quality global decisions that can be iteratively refined based on human feedback. Empirical findings showcase GMS's substantial improvement in system resilience and responsiveness to uncertainties, with decision times reduced from seconds to milliseconds. The study underscores the inherent creativity and diversity in the generated solutions, facilitating human-centric decision-making through seamless and continuous human-machine interactions.</description>

      <title>Formalising the intentional stance 1: attributing goals and beliefs to stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a formalism inspired by Dennett's notion of the intentional stance. Whereas Dennett's treatment of these concepts is informal, we aim to provide a more formal analogue. We introduce a framework based on stochastic processes with inputs and outputs, in which we can talk precisely about *interpreting* systems as having *normative-epistemic states*, which combine belief-like and desire-like features. Our framework is based on optimality but nevertheless allows us to model some forms of bounded cognition.
  One might expect that the systems that can be described in normative-epistemic terms would be some special subset of all systems, but we show that this is not the case: every system admits a (possibly trivial) normative-epistemic interpretation, and those that can be *uniquely specified* by a normative-epistemic description are exactly the deterministic ones. Finally, we show that there is a suitable notion of Bayesian updating for normative-epistemic states, which we call *value-laden filtering*, since it involves both normative and epistemic elements. For unbounded cognition it is always permissible to attribute beliefs that update in this way. This is not always the case for bounded cognition, but we give a sufficient condition under which it is.
  This paper gives an overview of our framework aimed at cognitive scientists, with a formal mathematical treatment given in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric states to realize specified changes in subsequent weather. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using the NWP model. The experiments showed that the identified perturbations successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Singular Value Decomposition for Large-scale Distributed Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the problem of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD), which is fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product from two different series of measurements. By combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach with parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using two application examples: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a novel and non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the communication cost associated with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.</description>
