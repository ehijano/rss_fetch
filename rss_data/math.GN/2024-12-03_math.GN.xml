      <title>On weakly $1$-convex and weakly $1$-semiconvex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work concerns generalized convex sets in the real multi-dimensional Euclidean space, known as weakly $1$-convex and weakly $1$-semiconvex sets. An open set is called weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) if, through every boundary point of the set, there passes a straight line (a closed ray) not intersecting the set. A closed set is called weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) if it is approximated from the outside by a family of open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) sets. A point of the complement of a set to the whole space is a $1$-nonconvexity ($1$-nonsemiconvexity) point of the set if every straight line passing through the point (every ray emanating from the point) intersects the set. It is proved that if the collection of all $1$-nonconvexity ($1$-nonsemiconvexity) points corresponding to an open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set is non-empty, then it is open. It is also proved that the non-empty interior of a closed weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set in the space is weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex).</description>

      <title>Relative simplicity of the universal coverings of transformation groups and Tsuboi's metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M, \omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Ends and end cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ends and end cohomology are powerful invariants for the study of noncompact spaces. We present a self-contained exposition of the topological theory of ends and prove novel extensions including the existence of an exhaustion of a proper map. We define reduced end cohomology as the relative end cohomology of a ray-based space. We use those results to prove a version of a theorem of King that computes the reduced end cohomology of an end sum of two manifolds. We include a complete proof of Freudenthal's fundamental theorem on the number of ends of a topological group, and we use our results on dimension-zero end cohomology to prove -- without using transfinite induction -- a theorem of N\"obeling on freeness of certain modules of continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Pseudocompact versus countably compact in first countable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this work is to construct spaces that are "pseudocompact but not countably compact," abbreviated as PNC, while endowing them with additional properties. First, motivated by an old problem of van Douwen, we construct from CH a locally compact and locally countable first countable PNC space with countable spread. A space is deemed "densely countably compact", denoted as DCC for brevity, if it possesses a dense, countable compact subspace. Moreover, a space qualifies as "densely relatively countably compact", abbreviated as DRC, if it contains a dense subset $D$ such that every infinite subset of $D$ has an accumulation point in $X$. A countably compact space is DCC, a DCC space is DRC, and a DRC space is evidently pseudocompact. The Tychonoff plank is a DCC space but is not countably compact. A $\Psi$-space belongs to the class of DRC spaces but is not DCC. Lastly, if $p\in {\omega}^*$ is not a P-point, then $T(p)$, representing the type of $p$ in ${\omega}^*$, constitutes a pseudocompact subspace of ${\omega}^*$ that is not \DRC. When considering a topological property denoted as $Q$, we define a space $X$ as "hereditarily $Q$" if every regular closed subspace of $X$ also possesses property $Q$. The Tychonoff plank and the $\Psi$-spaces are not hereditary examples. However, the aforementioned space $T(p)$ is a hereditary example, albeit not being first countable.
  In this paper we want to find (first countable) examples which separates these properties hereditarily. We have obtained the following result.
  (1) There is a DCC space $X$ such that no $H\in RC(X)^+$ is countably compact.
  (2) If CH holds, then there is a DRC space $Y$ such that no $H\in RC(Y)^+$ is DCC.
  (3) If CH holds, then there is a first countable pseudocompact space $Z$ such that no $H\in RC(Z)^+$ is DRC.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning 2.0: Artificial Neurons That Matter -- Reject Correlation, Embrace Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a yat-product-powered neural network, the Neural Matter Network (NMN), a breakthrough in deep learning that achieves non-linear pattern recognition without activation functions. Our key innovation relies on the yat-product and yat-product, which naturally induces non-linearity by projecting inputs into a pseudo-metric space, eliminating the need for traditional activation functions while maintaining only a softmax layer for final class probability distribution. This approach simplifies network architecture and provides unprecedented transparency into the network's decision-making process. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across different datasets demonstrates that NMN consistently outperforms traditional MLPs. The results challenge the assumption that separate activation functions are necessary for effective deep-learning models. The implications of this work extend beyond immediate architectural benefits, by eliminating intermediate activation functions while preserving non-linear capabilities, yat-MLP establishes a new paradigm for neural network design that combines simplicity with effectiveness. Most importantly, our approach provides unprecedented insights into the traditionally opaque "black-box" nature of neural networks, offering a clearer understanding of how these models process and classify information.</description>
