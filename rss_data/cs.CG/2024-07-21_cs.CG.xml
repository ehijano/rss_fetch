      <title>SimpleSets: Capturing Categorical Point Patterns with Simple Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Points of interest on a map such as restaurants, hotels, or subway stations, give rise to categorical point data: data that have a fixed location and one or more categorical attributes. Consequently, recent years have seen various set visualization approaches that visually connect points of the same category to support users in understanding the spatial distribution of categories. Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets, which uses simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns, thereby providing a clean overview of the data distribution. SimpleSets is designed to visualize sets of points with a single categorical attribute; as a result, the point patterns enclosed by SimpleSets form a partition of the data. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner. We compare SimpleSets to the state-of-the-art set visualizations using standard datasets from the literature.</description>

      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An eight-partition of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{5/2})$.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalises quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalised Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterise the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>
