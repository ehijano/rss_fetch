      <title>Towards high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers in numerical relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.</description>

      <title>White dwarf-neutron star binaries: a plausible pathway for long-duration gamma-ray bursts from compact object mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two long-duration gamma-ray bursts were recently discovered with kilonovae, the signature of r-process element production in a compact binary merger, rather than supernovae. This has forced a re-evaluation of the long-established dichotomy between short bursts (&lt; 2s, arising from compact binary mergers) and long bursts (&gt; 2s, a class of massive star core-collapse event). We aim to determine whether white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) and white dwarf-black hole (WDBH) mergers are plausible explanations for long-duration compact merger GRBs, in terms of their galactocentric merger offsets and cosmological rates. We model the host galaxies of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and employ binary population synthesis, to predict the offset distributions of compact mergers. We compare with the observed offsets, investigate evolutionary pathways, predict their cosmological rates, and compare with volumetric GRB rates. We find that WDNS mergers occur at lower host offsets than binary NS mergers, but that in the specific cases of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, the observed offsets are consistent with either scenario. We predict that WDNS mergers occur at a similar rate to binary NS mergers and long GRBs, and that WDBH mergers are a factor of ten rarer, with the caveat that these rates currently carry uncertainties at the order of magnitude level. We have demonstrated, solely in terms of galactocentric offsets and event rates, that WDNS mergers are a plausible explanation for GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and long GRBs from compact object mergers more generally. WDNS binaries have lower systemic velocities than binary neutron stars, but longer delay times, and ultimately merge with an offset distribution that is not measurably different without large samples. Therefore, offsets and rates alone cannot currently distinguish between compact binary progenitor models for supernova-less long duration GRBs.</description>

      <title>Supernova Rates and Luminosity Functions from ASAS-SN II: 2014-2017 core-collapse supernovae and their subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse supernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic history of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these rates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in the $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events, with high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us to obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby rates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by correcting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was estimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We find a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of 0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \leq -14$ mag. This result is in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric rates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL), and find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and interacting ccSNe are $63.2\%$, $32.3\%$, and $4.4\%$, respectively. We also estimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \ \textrm{yr}^{-1} \ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction of $0.002\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe and their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing luminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of their host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with increasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Type II SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: A Red Supergiant with Carbon-rich Circumstellar Dust as the First JWST Detection of a Supernova Progenitor Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present follow-up imaging and spectroscopy and pre-explosion imaging of supernova (SN) 2025pht located in NGC 1637 at 12 Mpc. Our spectroscopy shows that SN 2025pht is a Type II SN with broad lines of hydrogen and with minimal line-of-sight extinction inferred from Na I D absorption. NGC 1637 was the target of several epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging covering the site of SN 2025pht from 31 to 0.7 yr prior to discovery. Using a follow-up HST image of SN 2025pht aligned to these data, we demonstrate that there is a credible progenitor candidate detected in multiple epochs of HST imaging and in JWST imaging from 1.3-8.7 microns, the first JWST counterpart to a SN and the longest wavelength detection of a SN progenitor star. Fitting this source to red supergiant (RSG) spectral-energy distributions (SEDs), we show that it is consistent with a log(L/Lsun) = 5.0 RSG heavily reddened by circumstellar dust. The JWST photometry enable strong constraints on the nature of the circumstellar medium, and we find that the SED favors graphite-rich dust and an optical circumstellar extinction of Av = 5.3 mag as opposed to silicate-rich dust. We discuss the implications of a pre-SN RSG enshrouded in carbon-rich dust and this finding for the overall population of progenitor stars to Type II SN as well as the future of SN progenitor star discovery with JWST.</description>

      <title>Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before they explode: interpreting the nearby supernova SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that massive red supergiants (RSGs) become hydrodynamically unstable and experience radial pulsations before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the early photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can help break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, while hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and SN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show that there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study emphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying SNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Simulations of the Interaction Between the Nova/Supernova Ejecta and the Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many nova and type Ia supernova explosion scenarios involve accretion disks. However, direct numerical simulations of these explosive phenomena have barely addressed the question of the impact of ejecta-disk collision on the midterm evolution of such explosions. This is particularly critical for a better understanding of classical and recurrent novae, where each nova cycle depends on the imprint left by the precedent explosion. In this work, we describe and analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of the ejecta-disk interaction. We show that, depending on the initial configuration of the binary system, the disk is partially or, more often, totally destroyed, which will impact the next nova-explosion cycle. In the case of type Ia supernovae, the much larger kinetic energy carried by the ejecta always provokes complete destruction of the accretion disk. We also discuss the alterations induced in the geometry of the ejecta by the shielding effect of the disk, which has shown to cause reduced contamination of the companion star up to a factor \sim 1.5 - 2 in key nuclei produced during the nova outburst. In the framework of recurrent nova simulations, we report for the first time on the formation of a cavity in the ejecta after its interaction with the disk. We also describe the onset and development of several hydrodynamic instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz and Richtmyer-Meshkov.</description>

      <title>The Mass of Cosmic Rays of Ultra High Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of several analyses is presented that forces the conclusion that the mass composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays is not proton-dominated. This deduction, combined with the use of a modern hadronic interaction model, should lead to a re-evaluation of the energy spectrum reported by the Telescope Collaboration that may well bring that measurement, and the corresponding one from the Pierre Auger Observatory, into better agreement.</description>

      <title>Improving Air Shower Simulations by Tuning Pythia 8/Angantyr with Accelerator Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses, achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately, before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables. Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level and energy deposit profiles, are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an area of 3,300 square degrees, a search for pulsed dispersed signals using a neural network has been carried out. During the six-month observation period, pulses were detected from fifteen known pulsars as well as three new rotating radio transients (RRATs). The main characteristics of these new sources were provided. The dispersion measures of the transients and the half-widths of the pulses ranged from 7.2 to 59.9 pc/cm$^3$ and from 20 to 300 ms, respectively. A RRAT search scheme has been developed that allows for the detection of pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) below the threshold required for reliable detection.</description>

      <title>Pair Cascades in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) of soft thermal photons by relativistic particles on closed magnetic field loops has been proposed to explain the hard emission observed up to, and beyond, 200 keV from magnetars. If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors &gt;= 10^2, the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and photon splitting in the ultra-strong magnetar fields, producing additional spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo simulation and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split photon spectra dominate the RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular, the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40% - 80%, are softer than the RICS spectra and may account for the high polarization of some magnetar spectra observed by IXPE above 3 keV.</description>

      <title>SN 2021aaev: a Hydrogen-Rich Superluminous Supernova with Early Flash and Long-Lived Circumstellar Interaction in an Unusual Host Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN\,2021aaev, a hydrogen-rich, superluminous supernova with persistent (at least $\sim100$ days) narrow Balmer lines (SLSN-IIn) at redshift $z=0.1557$. We observed SN\,2021aaev to rise in $32.5 \pm 1.0$ days since first light and reach a peak absolute magnitude of $-21.46 \pm 0.01$ in the ATLAS $o$ band. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of typical SNe IIn with flash-ionization features arising from the interaction with a dense, confined circumstellar medium (CSM), albeit the flash timescale is longer than usual ($&gt;20$ days). Post peak, the narrow emission lines evolve slowly, and the absence of ejecta features indicates strong deceleration by the CSM. The total radiated energy (about $1.41\times10^{51}$~ergs) is possible with a low-mass (1--$2\,M_{\odot}$) ejecta ploughing into a massive (9--$19\,M_{\odot}$), extended (outer radius $&gt;1\times10^{16}$~cm) H-rich CSM, or alternatively, with magnetar-powered models. Interestingly, the host environment consists of a spiral galaxy with a red substructure in the south-eastern part, and the SN's exact location coincided with the quiescent red substructure (star-formation rate$=0.02^{+0.13}_{-0.02}\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). Given the atypical environment and the obscuring effect of the massive CSM, a thermonuclear (Type Ia-CSM) origin cannot be ruled out. Altogether, SN\,2021aaev is a compelling case to study the diversity of SLSN-IIn features and their host environment.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Precessing Jet in Envelope of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ``zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} &lt; \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteris</description>

      <title>Polarized Emission of Intrabinary Shocks in Spider Pulsars from Global 3D Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\circ$ inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree $\gtrsim15\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.</description>

      <title>Cooling of quark stars from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of quark stars with and without a hadronic crust using an equation of state derived from perturbative QCD that incorporates the running of the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Our analysis reveals that bare quark stars cool too rapidly to match the luminosity data, including those of the coldest observed isolated neutron stars, even when the uncertainty from the renormalization scale is taken into account. In contrast, configurations featuring a hadronic crust exhibit slower cooling and improved agreement with observational data. We also observe that the cooling band for bare quark stars narrows significantly after $t \sim 1$ year, whereas the configurations with a crust exhibit a larger uncertainty throughout their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Collisional and Collisionless Plasma Shocks: A Simulation Study using OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock waves in plasmas can be characterized by the mechanisms behind their formation. When binary collisions are frequent, dissipation is collision-driven and the shock width is a few mean free paths. In contrast, collisionless shocks rely on collective plasma processes to establish dissipation on scales well below the mean free path. We bridge these regimes with particle-in-cell simulations using OSIRIS with a Coulomb-collision module, varying parameters that control collisionality. We find a smooth transition of the shock width in the intermediate region where the ion plasma parameter $N_D \approx 1$. Our results recover the asymptotic predictions: a collisional-regime width consistent with the Mott-Smith ansatz with a BGK operator, and the collisionless limit consistent with Tidman's classical formalism. The ion plasma parameter thus serves as a practical metric for identifying when shocks shift from fluid-like, mean-free-path scales to collisionless, sub-mean-free-path scales. We discuss implications for astrophysical environments, where shock breakout changes the shock width and marks the onset of efficient particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Probes for String-Inspired Foam, Lorentz, and CPT Violations in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is such a basic principle in fundamental physics that it must be constantly tested and that any proposal of its violation and breakdown of CPT symmetry, that might characterize some approaches to quantum gravity, should be treated with care. In this review we examine, among other scenarios, such instances in supercritical~(Liouville) string theory, particularly in some brane models for ``quantum foam''. Using the phenomenological formalism introduced here, we analyze the observational hints of Lorentz violation in time-of-flight lags of cosmic photons and neutrinos which fit excellently stringy space-time foam scenarios. We further demonstrate how stringent constraints from other astrophysical data, including the recent first detections of multi-TeV events in $\gamma$-ray burst 221009A and PeV cosmic photons by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), are satisfied in this context. Such models thus provide a unified framework for all currently observed phenomenologies of space-time symmetry breaking at Planckian scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) is a next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) facility on the Moon. By harnessing the Moon's unique environment, LILA fills a critical observational gap in the mid-band GW spectrum ($0.1 - 10$ Hz) between terrestrial detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA) and the future space mission LISA. Observations enabled by LILA will fundamentally transform multi-messenger astrophysics and GW probes of fundamental physics. LILA will measure the lunar deep interior better than any existing planetary seismic instruments. The LILA mission is designed for phased development aligned with capabilities of the U.S.'s Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs. LILA is a unique collaboration between universities, space industries, U.S. government laboratories, and international partners.</description>

      <title>Spatial models of r-process remnants and their gamma-ray detectability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability of gamma-ray emission from long-lived radioactive isotopes in r-process-enriched remnants, focusing on how assumptions about their spatial distribution introduce uncertainty into detection prospects. Using a suite of physically motivated models for the Galactic distribution of kilonova and supernova remnants, we simulate synthetic remnant populations and compute their time-evolving gamma-ray spectra. We then compare these flux predictions to the sensitivity limits of next-generation instruments such as COSI and HEX-P. We find that even under optimistic assumptions, detection probabilities with COSI are extremely low ($\ll 1\%$), and that marginal improvements are only possible with instruments like HEX-P if prior localization is available. The choice of spatial distribution model can lead to more than an order-of-magnitude variation in expected line fluxes at low instrument sensitivities, underscoring the role of spatial modeling as a dominant source of uncertainty. Nevertheless, instrumental capability remains the fundamental bottleneck, and a hybrid mission combining COSI-like sky coverage with HEX-P-level line sensitivity would be required to make detection more probable than not.</description>

      <title>The morphology of supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 implies explosion by jittering-jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine the morphology of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1 and reveal a point-symmetrical morphology that implies shaping by three or more pairs of jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two bright rims. I compare this ear with its rims to an ear with three rims of a jet-shaped planetary nebula and jets from an active galactic nucleus that shaped several rims on one side. Based on this similarity, I argue that two jets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I identified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a jet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I base this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR G309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry axes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of SNR G0.9+0.1. I show that the morphological features of holes, granular texture, and random filaments exist in CCSNe and planetary nebulae and are unlikely to result from some unique processes in CCSNe. These structures result from similar instabilities in the JJEM and the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and, unlike a point-symmetric morphology, cannot determine the explosion mechanism. Identifying SNR G0.9+0.1 as a new point-symmetric CCSN strengthens the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that, for a PBH abundance $\Omega_\text{PBH}/\Omega_\text{DM} = 0.01$, this mechanism naturally produces a population of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of $\mathcal{O}(0.3)$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. Notably, most mergers arise in low-mass galaxies, making the latter rate sensitive to the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function. The dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of long period transients have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704--37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems under various scenarios and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.</description>

Abstract: Tracking the correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities during black hole X-ray binary outbursts is a key diagnostic of the coupling between accretion inflows (traced by X-rays) and relativistic jet outflows (traced by radio). We present the radio--X-ray correlation of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Our observations span a broad dynamic range, covering $\sim$4 orders of magnitude in radio luminosity and $\sim$6.5 in X-ray luminosity. This source follows an unusually radio-quiet track, exhibiting significantly lower radio luminosities at a given X-ray luminosity than both the standard (radio-loud) track and most previously known radio-quiet systems. Across most of the considered distance range ($D {\sim} 1.5-4.3$ kpc), Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 appears to be the most radio-quiet black hole binary identified to date. For distances ${\geq} 4$ kpc, while Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 becomes comparable to one other extremely radio-quiet system, its peak X-ray luminosity (${\gtrsim} 5{\times}10^{38}$ erg/s) exceeds that of any previously reported hard-state black hole low-mass X-ray binary, emphasising the extremity of this outburst. Additionally, for the first time in a radio-quiet system, we identify the onset of X-ray spectral softening to coincide with a change in trajectory through the radio--X-ray plane. We assess several proposed explanations for radio-quiet behaviour in black hole systems in light of this dataset. As with other such sources, however, no single mechanism fully accounts for the observed properties, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring and the value of comprehensive (quasi-)simultaneous datasets.</description>

Abstract: The interaction cross section of charged pions with air nuclei is a critical parameter for accurately simulating extensive air showers. Improving the modeling of high-energy pion interactions is essential for addressing the muon puzzle-the observed deficit of muons in simulations compared to indirect experimental estimates. As collider experiments cannot directly probe these interactions, we propose a novel measurement approach using muon bundles detected in deep-underground water Cherenkov detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT. This method aims to constrain the pion-air inelastic cross section, thereby reducing uncertainties in air shower simulations and advancing our understanding of cosmic ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Daily fluctuations propagate damply through the accretion disk of Swift J1727.8-1613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propagating fluctuations within accretion disks are known to induce multi-wavelength variability across diverse timescales. While these fluctuations have been widely invoked to explain rapid timing phenomena within the inner disk region in the frequency domain, observational signatures of outer-disk fluctuations propagating in the time domain remain sparse. Here, we present an analysis of observations by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) during the 2023 outburst of the newly discovered low-mass black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. Follow-up, high-cadence monitoring reveals intense variability in disk emission, attributable to fluctuations in the accretion rate. These disk fluctuations exhibit damped amplitudes and shortened flare periods. We interpret these features as observational evidence of fluctuations originating at and propagating from large radii, supported by fitting the disk light curves with a propagating fluctuation model. Furthermore, we propose that a plausible mechanism driving these fluctuations is the cyclical propagation of heating and cooling fronts in the context of the disk instability model. This work bridges theoretical predictions with time-domain observations, offering critical insights into the dynamic processes governing accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic approaches to rotating neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R &lt;&lt; 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Structure and Binary Inspiral Gravitational Waves from Quantum Hadrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs, one of the compact objects in the universe, play a crucial role in astrophysical research and provide a platform for exploring nuclear physics. In this work, we extend the relativistic mean field approach by using a Walecka-type quantum hadrodynamics model to capture the intricate structure of white dwarfs. We calculate nuclear properties, Coulomb energy, and photon energy within white dwarfs in a unified framework. By carefully calibrating the model parameters to align with nuclear matter properties, we successfully reproduce the structures of several elements in white dwarfs, such as the isotopes of $\rm C$ and $^{16}\rm O$, except for the unnaturally deeply bound state $^4$He. Furthermore, we predict the characteristics of white dwarfs composed of atom-like units and the gravitational waves stemming from binary white dwarf inspirals incorporating tidal deformability contributions up to the 2.5 post-Newtonian order. These results shed light on the structure of white dwarfs and provide valuable information for future gravitational wave detection. This methodological advancement allows for a cohesive analysis of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and the nuclear pasta within a unified theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a wide class of spacetimes arising from different parameter regimes of the generalized Hayward metric, characterized by two independent parameters $(\sigma, \kappa)$ (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028). This metric extends the original Hayward regular black hole solution by introducing distinct mass functions in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components, giving rise to four types of wormholes ( which include multi-peak effective potentials), a regular black hole, and a singular black hole solutions allowing for a unified treatment of black hole mimickers. We compute the shadow radii for all spacetimes in vacuum and in the presence of plasma, using both homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma profiles. Our results show that certain wormhole solutions particularly the Hayward-Damour-Solodukhin class can exhibit multiple photon spheres, leading to shadow features that differ significantly from the Schwarzschild black hole. When these results are compared with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr~$A^\star$, we find that regular black holes remain observationally viable but only within a narrow parameter space. In contrast, wormhole solutions with multi-peak effective potentials are more consistent with shadow constraints than those with single peaks. This contrasts with quasinormal mode studies, which favored single-barrier potentials, and may imply detectable late-time echoes in gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>A new way to find symbiotic stars: accretion disc detection with continuum survey photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are binaries in which a cool and evolved star of luminosity class I-III accretes onto a smaller companion. However, direct accretion signatures like disc flickering and boundary layer X-rays are typically outshone or suppressed by the luminous giant, shell burning on the accreting white dwarf, and the illuminated wind nebula. We present a new way to find symbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than methods based on narrow-band H$\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate surveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using reconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three exposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a sample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours of large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that flickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a different region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only symbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with another survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics, including four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical flickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10 symbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known symbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436). We conclude that at least 20% of the true population of symbiotics exhibit detectable optical flickering from the inner accretion disc, the majority of which do not meet the H$\alpha$ detection thresholds used to find symbiotics in typical narrow-band surveys.</description>

      <title>What drives the growth of black holes: a decade of progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Doubly regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at nonextremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that, while they may be regular in physical space, they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.</description>

      <title>Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.</description>
