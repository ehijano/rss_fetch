      <title>High Gain Fusion Target Design using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. The result is practical, room temperature targets that can yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, enabling Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Opacity Project: R-Matrix Calculations for Opacities of High-Energy-Density Astrophysical and Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of opacity is critical for understanding radiation transport in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. We employ atomic data from R-Matrix calculations to investigate radiative properties in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources. Specifically, we analyze environments such as the base of the convective zone (BCZ) of the Sun 2 x 10^6$ K, N_e = 10^{23}/cc and the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device at the Sandia Z facility 2.11 x 10^6 K, N_e = 3.16 x 10^{22}/cc. We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the "chemical picture" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as valuable tools, offering idealized experiments with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. The procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. The ionization balance results obtained from the application of this algorithm are compared with an additional method based on the potential energy of the particles in the simulations, finding good agreement, therefore validating the use of this approach.</description>

      <title>Flux-driven turbulent transport using penalisation in the Hasegawa-Wakatani system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First numerical results from the newly-developed pseudo-spectral code P-FLARE (Penalised FLux-driven Algorithm for REduced models) are presented. This flux-driven turbulence/transport code uses a pseudo-spectral formulation with the penalisation method in order to impose radial boundary conditions. Its concise, flexible structure allows implementing various quasi-two dimensional reduced fluid models in flux-driven formulation. Here, results from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system are discussed, where particle transport and zonal flow formation, together with profile relaxation, are studied. It is shown that coupled spreading/profile relaxation that one obtains for this system is consistent with a simple one dimensional model of coupled spreading/transport equations. Then, the effect of a particle source is investigated, which results in the observation of sandpile-like critical behaviour. The model displays profile stiffness for certain parameters, with very different input fluxes resulting in very similar mean density gradients. This is due to different zonal flow levels around the critical value for the control parameter (i.e. the ratio of the adiabaticity parameter to the mean gradient) and the existence for this system of a hysteresis loop for the transition from 2D turbulence to a zonal flow dominated state.</description>
