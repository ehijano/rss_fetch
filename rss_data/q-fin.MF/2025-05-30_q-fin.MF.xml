      <title>Model-Free Deep Hedging with Transaction Costs and Light Data Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Option pricing theory, such as the Black and Scholes (1973) model, provides an explicit solution to construct a strategy that perfectly hedges an option in a continuous-time setting. In practice, however, trading occurs in discrete time and often involves transaction costs, making the direct application of continuous-time solutions potentially suboptimal. Previous studies, such as those by Buehler et al. (2018), Buehler et al. (2019) and Cao et al. (2019), have shown that deep learning or reinforcement learning can be used to derive better hedging strategies than those based on continuous-time models. However, these approaches typically rely on a large number of trajectories (of the order of $10^5$ or $10^6$) to train the model. In this work, we show that using as few as 256 trajectories is sufficient to train a neural network that significantly outperforms, in the Geometric Brownian Motion framework, both the classical Black &amp; Scholes formula and the Leland model, which is arguably one of the most effective explicit alternatives for incorporating transaction costs. The ability to train neural networks with such a small number of trajectories suggests the potential for more practical and simple implementation on real-time financial series.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Policy on Dividend and Capital Injection under Time-inconsistent Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the dividend and capital injection problem under a diffusion risk model with general discount functions. A proportional cost is imposed when injecting capitals. For exponential discounting as time-consistent benchmark, we obtain the closed-form solutions and show that the optimal strategies are of threshold type. Under general discount function which leads to time-inconsistency, we adopt the definition of weak equilibrium and obtain the extended HJB equation system. An explicit solution is derived under pseudo-exponential discounting where three cases of the dividend and capital injection thresholds are obtained. Numerical examples show that large capital injection cost may lead to no capital injection at all, while larger difference in group discount rate leads to higher equilibrium value function.</description>

      <title>Exponential Utility Maximization in a Continuous Time Gaussian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the continuous time exponential utility maximization problem in the framework of an investor who is informed about the price changes with a delay. This leads to a non-Markovian stochastic control problem. In the case where the risky asset is given by a Gaussian process (with some additional properties) we establish a solution for the optimal control and the corresponding value. Our approach is purely probabilistic and is based on the theory for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of Gaussian measures developed by Shepp \cite{S:66}, Hitsuda \cite{H:68} and received a new and unifying angle in [2].</description>

      <title>Travelling wave solutions of an equation of Harry Dym type arising in the Black-Scholes framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes framework is crucial in pricing a vast number of financial instruments that permeate the complex dynamics of world markets. Associated with this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x, {\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\partial_x^2 -\partial_x)$ that carries a variable volatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$ and a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility model. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find a non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a time-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the Harry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave solutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and integrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent structures in financial-market volatility studies.</description>
