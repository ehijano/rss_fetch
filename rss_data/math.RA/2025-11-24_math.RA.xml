      <title>On the abelianization of the special derivation Lie algebras of free Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there are infinitely many linearly independent elements in the abelianization of the Lie algebra of special derivations of a free Lie algebra by using the Morita traces. Furthermore, we show that the abelianization contains non-trivial elements which are killed by the Morita traces.</description>

      <title>Realizing orders in rational sphere product algebras with three generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization problem asks which algebras can be realized as the cohomology of spaces. We study this problem in the context of the orders in a graded rational exterior algebra on three generators. An order is a subring whose underlying additive group is a lattice. We give conditions for when such an order is realizable, and in particular show that in the simply-connected case any order is realizable if the generators of the exterior algebra are odd.</description>

      <title>Cylindric quasi-implication algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the operation of Sasaki hook within the setting of quantum cylindric algebras by introducing cylindric quasi-implication algebras. It is first demonstrated that every quantum cylindric algebra can be converted into a cylindric quasi-implication algebra and conversely that every cylindric quasi-implication algebra gives rise to a quantum cylindric algebra. These constructions are then shown to induce an isomorphism between the category $\mathbf{CQIA}$ of cylindric quasi-implication algebras and the category $\mathbf{QCA}$ of quantum cylindric algebras. We then give two alternative constructions of a cylindric orthoframe $X_A$ from a cylindric quasi-implication algebra $A$. The first construction of $X_A$ arises via the non-zero elements of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by Harding in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of MacNeille completions. The second construction of $X_A$ arises via the proper filters of $A$ and generalizes the construction given by McDonald in the setting of cylindric ortholattices from the perspective of canonical completions.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Deformations via Incidence Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified geometric realization of the classical deformation complexes. We construct GL-equivariant bilinear incidence varieties whose diagonal slices recover the varieties of associative, commutative, Leibniz, and Lie algebra structures on a finite-dimensional vector space. We prove that the fiber of the incidence map at a given algebra law is canonically isomorphic to the space of 2-cocycles in the corresponding cohomology theory (Hochschild, Harrison, Leibniz, or Chevalley--Eilenberg). Furthermore, we introduce invariant bilinear forms to define open strata of separable and semisimple algebras, and demonstrate that these strata consist of open GL-orbits, establishing the rigidity of generic points in the coarse moduli spaces for all four geometries.</description>

      <title>The relationship between local derivations and local automorphisms of some associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper local derivations and local automorphisms of five-dimensional naturally graded nilpotent associative algebras are studied. Namely, a general form of the matrices of local derivations and local automorphisms of algebras $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ is clarified. It turns out that the general form of the matrix of an automorphism (derivation) on these algebras does not coincide with the local automorphism's (resp. local derivation's) matrix's general form on these algebras. Therefore, these associative algebras have local automorphisms (resp. local derivations) that are not automorphisms (resp. derivations). We also establish a relationship between local automorphisms and local derivations via an exponential expression. We prove that the sets of local derivations of algebras $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ form Lie algebras with respect to the Lie brackets. Thus, we show that the Lie algebra problem from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems for local derivations of the algebras under consideration has a positive solution. The other problems from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems have a positive (negative) solution for algebra $\pi_2$ (resp. algebra $\pi_3$)</description>

      <title>Chemical Systems as Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings:Theory, Case Studies, and Operational Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical systems are traditionally described by lists of species, reactions, and externally imposed kinetic laws, a framework that lacks an intrinsic algebraic structure governing how transformations compose. We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices. The resulting framework unifies equilibrium, kinetics, regulation, and chemical computation within a single algebraic language, offering new principles for the analysis and design of responsive or self-regulating materials.</description>

      <title>Abstract fractional linear transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin with (densely-defined) fractional linear transformations (FLT) on (some) Banach algebras and their relatives. This leads to Wedderburn's continued fractions (recursively-defined noncommutative polynomials) for any ring. Along the way, we discover a one-parameter family of (noncommutative) polynomials \st if one of them is invertible, then read in the opposite order, the corresponding polynomial is also invertible (extending the well known $1+ab$ is invertible if $1+ ba$ is, and the not-so-well-known, $a + abc + c$ and $a + cba + c$).
  This in turn leads to a definition of FLT for general rings $R$, which turns out to be PE$(2,R)$ (the projective elementary group). Using Wedderburn's polynomials, this permits us to define a length function on PE$(2,R)$, which suggests a stable range type condition (for $n =1$, it {\it is\/} stable range one, but higher values do not correspond.
  Again using the length results, we prove the expected results for PE$(2,R)$: under very modest conditions on $R$, the commutator subgroup of PE$(2,R)$ is perfect and of index one or two.
  Along the same lines, we also prove results on simplicity of the commutator subgroup: we require the usual generative properties on the simple ring $R$, as well either the very restrictive $1$ in the range, or a mild condition about invertibles, involving intersections of three translates of GL$(1,R)$. This last property is explored in the appendices, which give examples (and non-examples).
  Numerous questions suggest themselves throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notions of idempotental identities and axial identities of axial algebras are introduced, in order to understand better some theorems of J.~Desmet, I.~Gorshkov, S.~Shpectorov, and A.~Staroletov about solid subalgebras; this approach produces generic examples, including an example of an axial algebra of Jordan type 1/2 with a Frobenius form having radical 0, which is neither Jordan nor a homomorphic image of a Matsuo algebra.</description>

      <title>Algebraic quantum groups and duality I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(A,\Delta)$ be a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The linear dual $B$ of $A$ is again a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The duality is given by an element $V\in B\otimes A$, defined by $\langle V,a\otimes b\rangle=\langle a,b\rangle$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. We use $\langle\,\cdot\, , \,\cdot\,\rangle$ for the pairings. In the introduction of this paper, we recall the various properties of this element $V$ as sitting in the algebra $B\otimes A$. More generally, we can consider an algebraic quantum group $(A,\Delta)$. We use the term here for a regular multiplier Hopf algebra with integrals. For $B$ we now take the dual $\widehat A$ of $A$. It is again an algebraic quantum group. In this case, the duality gives rise to an element $V$ in the multiplier algebra $M(B\otimes A)$. Still, most of the properties of $V$ in the finite-dimensional case are true in this more general setting. The focus in this paper lies on various aspects of the duality between $A$ and its dual $\widehat A$. Among other things we include a number of formulas relating the objects associated with an algebraic quantum group and its dual. This note is meant to give a comprehensive, yet concise (and sometimes simpler) account of these known results. This is part I of a series of three papers on this subject. The case of a multiplier Hopf $^*$-algebra with positive integrals is treated in detail in part II and part III.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}{p_2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of algebras called skew-Brauer graph algebras, which generalize the well-known Brauer graph algebras. We establish that skew-Brauer graph algebras are symmetric and can be defined using a Brauer graph with additional information. We show that the class of trivial extensions of skew-gentle algebras coincides with a subclass of skew-Brauer graph algebras, where the associated skew-Brauer graph has multiplicity function identically equal to one, generalizing a result over gentle algebras. We also characterize skew-Brauer algebras of finite representation type. Finally, we provide a geometric interpretation of cut-sets and reflections of algebras using orbifold dissections.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class of monomorphisms in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of the class.</description>

      <title>Real $C$-, $G$-structures and sign-coherence of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</description>

      <title>Sign-coherence and tropical sign pattern for rank $3$ real cluster-cyclic exchange matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sign-coherence about $c$-vectors was conjectured by Fomin-Zelevinsky and solved completely by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich for integer skew-symmetrizable case. We prove this conjecture associated with $c$-vectors for rank 3 real cluster-cyclic skew-symmetrizable case. Simultaneously, we establish their self-contained recursion and monotonicity. Then, these $c$-vectors are proved to be roots of certain quadratic equations. Based on these results, we prove that the corresponding exchange graphs of $C$-pattern and $G$-pattern are $3$-regular trees. We also study the structure of tropical signs and equip the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_6$ with a cluster realization via certain mutations.</description>
