      <title>RESuM: Rare Event Surrogate Model for Physics Detector Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental discovery of neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) would answer one of the most important questions in physics: Why is there more matter than antimatter in our universe? To maximize the chances of detection, NLDBD experiments must optimize their detector designs to minimize the probability of background events contaminating the detector. Given that this probability is inherently low, design optimization either requires extremely costly simulations to generate sufficient background counts or contending with significant variance. In this work, we formalize this dilemma as a Rare Event Design (RED) problem: identifying optimal design parameters when the design metric to be minimized is inherently small. We then designed the Rare Event Surrogate Model (RESuM) for physics detector design optimization under RED conditions. RESuM uses a pretrained Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model to incorporate additional prior knowledges into a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process model. We applied RESuM to optimize neutron moderator designs for the LEGEND NLDBD experiment, identifying an optimal design that reduces neutron background by ($66.5\pm3.5$)% while using only 3.3% of the computational resources compared to traditional methods. Given the prevalence of RED problems in other fields of physical sciences, the RESuM algorithm has broad potential for simulation-intensive applications.</description>

      <title>Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>Study of radon removal performance of silver-ion exchanged zeolite from air for underground experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radon is a common background source for underground astroparticle physics experiments and its removal is essential. In this study, we fabricated several prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolites, measured their radon adsorption properties, and evaluated their applicability for radon removal in underground experiments. As a result, we succeeded in producing a prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolite that showed better radon adsorption properties than preceding studies.</description>

      <title>Study of Gas Electron Multiplier Detector Using ANSYS and GARFIELD$^{++}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) represent a category of gaseous ionization detectors that utilize microelectronics. They feature a remarkably small distance between the high potential difference anode and cathode electrodes and are typically filled with gases. When a high-energy particle interacts with the gas medium, it generates ions and electrons, which are subsequently accelerated in opposite directions due to the applied electric field. Deflected electrons trigger further ionization to create electron-ion pairs through an avalanche process. These particles can be detected with very high precision at the readout. The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is one type of MPGD constructed with a polyimide film sandwiched between two conductors under a high voltage difference. Microscopic holes in the foil facilitate electron avalanche. However, the current geometry of the GEM detector used in various experiments is sub-optimal for the gain and performance. In this study, we have modified the geometry of the GEM detector to enhance the gain, reduce ions backflow, and enhance the performance of the detector. We are proposing a new geometry of the GEM detector foil for higher gain, better performance, and durability. For this study, the geometry has been constructed in ANSYS, and further studies have been performed using Garfield$^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid optical sensor for combined thermal and dimensional monitoring in laser processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical measurements enable non-contact and high-speed monitoring of physical processes, offering a non-invasive and versatile approach across a wide range of fields, from scientific research to industrial applications. In this work, an optical sensor capable of simultaneously measuring the distance and thermal emission of surfaces is presented, based on a simple laser diode probe. The principle of operation integrates triangulation with pyrometry in a single device, utilizing the monitor photodiode embedded within the probe package. By alternating the laser emission, the readout can rapidly switch between dimensional and thermal measurements, resulting in combined data acquisition. The presented method is compact, easy to integrate, and cost-effective. The hybrid sensor is implemented into a laser processing setup, where a metallic target is heated and melted by a high-power laser beam. Its inline operation is demonstrated in real-time for dynamic measurements of melt pool distance and radiance. This innovative approach can find applications in diverse fields, such as remote environmental sensing and closed-loop control systems for stabilizing high-temperature processes, including laser welding and additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Compact Cavity-Enhanced Aerosol Detector using Incoherent Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have realized a compact optical particle counter utilizing enhancement of light scattering within a high finesse Fabry-Perot optical cavity. In contrast to laser-based approaches such as cavity ringdown spectroscopy we use the light stream from both superluminescent and light-emitting diodes that have no longitudinal coherence. This eliminates the vibration sensitivity that is typical of laser-based cavity methods. The use of the transmission mode of detection allows us to reduce the cavity mirror separation to below 1 cm, with no obvious limit to miniaturization. Typical light scattering instruments are larger, in part due to their sensitivity to background signals from the light source. Our approach paves the way toward a new generation of compact and portable instruments. A simultaneous comparison of the scattering signals with a commercial particle counter shows that our cavity is also sensitive to ultrafine particles below 300 nm diameter that are typically not recorded in such counters.</description>

      <title>Experimentation at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental activities involving multi-TeV muon collisions are a relatively recent endeavor. The community has limited experience in designing detectors for lepton interactions at center-of-mass energies of 10 TeV and beyond. This review provides a short overview of the machine characteristics and outlines potential sources of beam-induced background that could impact the detector performance. The strategy for mitigating the effects of beam-induced background on the detector at $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV is discussed, focusing on the machine-detector interface, detector design, and the implementation of reconstruction algorithms. The physics potential at this center-of-mass energy is evaluated using a detailed detector simulation that incorporates the effects of beam-induced background. This evaluation concerns the Higgs boson couplings and the Higgs field potential sensitivity, that then are used to get confidence on the expectations at 10 TeV. The physics and detector requirements for an experiment at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV, outlined here, form the foundation for the initial detector concept at that center-of-mass energy .</description>

      <title>Measuring Absolute Velocities from Non-Equilibrium Oscillations via Single-Detector 3D Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-detector 3D dynamic light scattering (3D-DLS) emerges as a reliable technique to determine the drift velocity of out-of-equilibrium colloidal particles. In particular, our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity when particles are immersed in a medium exposed to thermally induced convection. These oscillations arise as a consequence of the directed motion of particles due to the convective motion of the fluid. The experimental results obtained for different colloidal systems are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations. The excellent agreement between experimental, theoretical and simulation data allows us to provide a solid and comprehensive explanation of the observed physical phenomena. This study via advanced dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique offers insights into the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, applicable not only to colloidal suspension affected by steady-state diffusion-convection but also to other non-equilibrium situations, such as systems driven by external fields (gravitational, electric or magnetic fields, among others).</description>
