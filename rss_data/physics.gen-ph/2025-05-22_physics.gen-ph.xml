      <title>Revisiting Varying Speed of Light in Cosmology: Insights from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, a varying speed of light (VSL) reflects a change in the clock rate across hypersurfaces, described by the lapse function. This variation is not a dynamical field evolution but a consequence of coordinate choice, as the cosmic time coincides with the proper time of comoving observers due to the Weyl postulate. From an action principle including $\tilde c$, we derive that $\tilde c$ does not have its dynamics but imposes a constraint on the scale factor $a(t)$, indicating that it is not an independent degree of freedom. This insight reframes the VSL concept as a manifestation of gauge freedom in general relativity, wherein physical laws remain invariant under smooth coordinate transformations. Here, gauge refers to the freedom of choosing the temporal coordinate (\textit{e.g.}, setting the lapse $N(t) \neq 1$), which determines how the speed of light appears in the cosmological equations. Recognizing $\tilde c$ as a coordinate-dependent quantity offers a new interpretation of cosmological time and observational tensions, such as the Hubble tension, without invoking new physical fields. This redefinition opens a novel theoretical pathway in interpreting cosmic expansion within a consistent relativistic framework.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Euclidean-Lorentzian Universe: Stability Considerations and the Point of Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TThe limited velocity implied by Lorentzian signature, prevents the universe to reach thermodynamic equilibrium implied by the CMB. Rapid expansion can occur by following Hawking and assuming a primordial Euclidean metric, in which case velocity is not limited and thermalization and rapid expansion are derived without the need to assume an ad-hoc field. Moreover, a mathematical model was given regarding the development of current Lorentzian space-time from the early Euclidean space-time in which problems such as initial singularity and the homogeneity of the CMB are solved. However, stability properties of the hybrid model were not discussed yet, nor was a mathematical criterion for the transition between the Euclidean and Lorentzian era's defined, those will be discussed here to some extant.</description>
