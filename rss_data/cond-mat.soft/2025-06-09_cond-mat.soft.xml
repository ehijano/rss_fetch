      <title>Crushing, Comminution and Fracture: Extreme Particle Deformation in Three-Dimensional Granular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-fidelity three dimensional computational framework for simulating the bulk mechanical behavior of granular aggregates composed of deformable brittle grains. Departing from classical discrete element methods (DEM), our approach captures both inter-particle and intra-particle deformation using a nonlocal continuum formulation based on peridynamics. Each grain is individually meshed from level-set representations, enabling accurate modeling of elastic response and autonomous fracture evolution without requiring explicit crack tracking or fragment reconstruction. We validate the method through benchmark simulations, including the Kalthoff-Winkler fracture test, crushing of hollow spheres, and compound impact-crushing scenarios. The framework is further applied to large aggregates of up to 1000 sand grains of irregular shapes reconstructed from three dimensional X-ray computed tomography. Simulations reveal convergence of bulk stress response under compression, suggesting the feasibility of constructing representative volume elements (RVEs) for multiscale modeling. Finally, we investigate the role of grain geometry and topology on the macroscopic strength of the aggregate, providing insight into microstructure-driven failure mechanisms. The framework exhibits excellent strong and weak scaling behavior, with simulations executed on up to 1600 cores, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing environments and large-scale modeling.</description>

      <title>3D tracking of Plankton with single-camera stereoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a device developed to perform a 3D tracking of passive or active particles under flow, confined in a medium of hundreds micrometers wide. Micro-objects are placed inside a vertical glass capillary and two mirrors are set behind it with a certain angle, making it possible to have the two reflections of the capillary on the same optical plane. A 3D reconstruction of the trajectories, captured with a single camera, is carried out along the vertical axis with a micrometer-scale precision. To investigate the interaction between the shear, the role of the gravity field, and motile microorganism, we track a model puller-type microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under a Poiseuille flow, using first its natural fluorescence and then a bright-field imaging. Understanding how confinement influences motility is crucial, and we show that this 3D tracking setup enables a full description of interactions between a motile organism and a solid border.</description>

      <title>The scaling regimes for unsteady diffusion across particle-stabilized fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal particles at fluid interfaces can enhance the stability of drops and bubbles. Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials, such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers, under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted in situ without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force (F) vs. indentation depth (D) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius (R) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: (1) the Hertzian regime (D&lt;0.1 R) with F=ER^0.5 D^1.5 16/9, (2) the parabolic regime (D&gt;10 R) with F=ED^2 \b{eta}, where the indenter radius becomes irrelevant, and (3) an intermediate regime (0.1 R&lt;D&lt;10 R) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ({\alpha}) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient (\b{eta}), allowing for the estimation of {\alpha} from \b{eta}. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases \b{eta}, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small {\alpha}. However, for {\alpha}&gt;3, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through in-situ testing.</description>

      <title>Cyclic loading of a heterogeneous non-linear poroelastic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic loading is a common feature in poroelastic systems, the material response depending non-trivially on the exact form of boundary conditions, pore structure, and mechanical properties. The situation becomes more complex when heterogeneity is introduced in the properties of the poroelastic material, yet heterogeneity too is common in physical poroelastic structures. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of a soft porous material in response to a uniaxial cyclic stress or displacement, with a focus on understanding how this response is affected by continuous heterogeneity in the stiffness or permeability. Our work is motivated by observed altered material properties of the diseased tendon, but the framework we develop and analyse is generically applicable. We construct a one-dimensional non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow through the pores of the solid skeleton which we assume has neo-Hookean elasticity. The system is driven by an applied uniaxial cyclic stress or a uniaxial cyclic displacement at one boundary. Heterogeneity in the stiffness or permeability profile is imposed via a Gaussian bump function. By exploring a range of loading frequencies together with magnitudes and locations of heterogeneity, we characterise the effect of heterogeneity on the response of the material, and show that the response of the system to an applied stress is qualitatively distinct from the response to an applied displacement. Our analysis of this simple model provides a foundation for understanding how heterogeneity affects the poroelastic response to cyclic loading.</description>

      <title>Rheology of bidisperse suspensions at the colloidal-to-granular transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use particle-based simulation to study the rheology of dense suspensions comprising mixtures of small colloids and larger grains, which exhibit shear thinning at low shear rates and shear thickening at high shear rates. By systematically varying the volume fraction of the two species, we demonstrate a monotonic increase in viscosity when grains are added to colloids, but, conversely, a nonmonotonic response in both the viscosity and shear thickening onset when colloids are added to grains. Both effects are most prominent at intermediate shear rates where diffusion and convection play similar roles in the dynamics. We rationalise these results by measuring the maximum flowable volume fraction as functions of the Peclet number and composition, showing that in extreme cases increasing the solids content can allow a jammed suspension to flow. These results establish a constitutive description for the rheology of bidisperse suspensions across the colloidal-to-granular transition, with implications for flow prediction and control in multicomponent particulate systems.</description>

      <title>pH-Dependent Zeta Potential Induces Diffusiophoretic Focusing in an Acid-Base Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusiophoresis of charged particles in the presence of electrolytes has been extensively studied in the literature. However, in these setups, particles typically move in a single direction, either up or down the electrolyte gradient. Here, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which a particle can reverse its diffusiophoretic direction within the same setup, leading to the formation of a focusing band under steady-state concentration gradients. Using multi-ion diffusiophoresis calculations, we simulate particle transport in an acid-based reaction system where salt is added alongside the acid. For a range of salt concentrations, particles focus within the channel. Our analysis reveals that a pH-dependent zeta potential is necessary for this focusing to occur, and determines where the particles focus, i.e., on or off the acid-base reaction front. We report qualitative agreement with prior experimental observations and derive analytical conditions governing particle focusing, highlighting the delicate balance between concentration gradients and zeta potential variations. The work elucidates the crucial physics of pH-dependent zeta potential and opens new avenues for exploring diffusiophoresis in acid-base systems, with implications for microfluidic design and biophysical transport processes.</description>

      <title>Defect-free and defective adaptations of crystalline sheets to stretching deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically, systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of covalently bonded particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of adhesion and phase separation during cell-cell contact across a viscous channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Polar and Nematic Order in Active Matter: Implications for Non-Equilibrium Physics and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of non-equilibrium systems, leading to a fundamental shift in the study of biophysical phenomena. The foundation of active matter research is built on assumptions regarding the symmetry of microscopic constituents. While these assumptions have been validated extensively, instances of mixed or joint symmetries are prevalent in biological systems. This review explores the coexistence of polar and nematic order in active matter, emphasizing the theoretical and experimental challenges associated with these systems. By integrating insights from recent studies, we highlight the importance of considering mixed symmetries to accurately describe biological processes. This exploration not only benefits the field of biology but could also open new horizons for non-equilibrium physics, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding complex behavior in active matter.</description>

      <title>Transient osmotic flows in a microfluidic channel: measurements of solute permeability and reflection coefficients of hydrogel membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first highlight theoretically a microfluidic configuration that allows to measure two fundamental parameters describing mass transport through a membrane: the solute permeability coefficient $\mathcal{L}_D$, and the associated reflection coefficient $\sigma$. This configuration exploits the high confinement of microfluidic geometries to relate these two coefficients to the dynamics of a transient flow induced by forward osmosis through a membrane embedded in a chip. We then applied this methodology to hydrogel membranes photo-crosslinked in a microchannel with \textit{in situ} measurements of osmotically-induced flows. These experiments enable us to estimate $\mathcal{L}_D$ and $\sigma$ and their dependence on the molecular weight of the solute under consideration, ultimately leading to a precise estimate of the molecular weight cut-off of these hydrogel membranes.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), has been investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from unpaired electron to nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate ($1/T_\mu$) measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields was analyzed by the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter ($\nu$) was evaluated over a temperature ($T$) range of 5--320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are in good agreement with those for the ``E-process'' revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three CC bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling in the atomic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider invariant transports of stationary random measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and establish natural mixing criteria that guarantee persistence of asymptotic variances. To check our mixing assumptions, which are based on two-point Palm probabilities, we combine factorial moment expansion with stopping set techniques, among others. We complement our results by providing formulas for the Bartlett spectral measure of the destinations. We pay special attention to the case of a vanishing asymptotic variance, known as hyperuniformity. By constructing suitable transports from a hyperuniform source we are able to rigorously establish hyperuniformity for many point processes and random measures. On the other hand, our method can also refute hyperuniformity. For instance, we show that finitely many steps of Lloyd's algorithm or of a random organization model preserve the asymptotic variance if we start from a Poisson process or a point process with exponentially fast decaying correlation. Finally, we define a hyperuniformerer that turns any ergodic point process with finite intensity into a hyperuniform process by randomizing each point within its cell of a fair partition.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of percolation when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations of Lipid Bilayers with the MDPD-MARTINI Force-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01225</link>

Abstract: Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.</description>

Abstract: This research paper comprehensively explores the effects of molecular weight and chain architecture on the interfacial and thermodynamic properties of cyclic and linear polymer blends. Utilizing the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model, the study meticulously investigates how these polymers behave at the polymer-wall interface, with a specific emphasis on their adsorption characteristics and thermal attributes. By showing the heat capacity and thermal stability of polymeric fluids, the research not only advances the understanding of these critical factors within polymer systems but also highlights the broader environmental implications associated with polymer degradation. The study examines the intricate interaction between molecular design parameters and functionality, revealing how variations in polymer architecture can lead to significant changes in performance and stability. Furthermore, it examines the potential for enhancing the lifecycle performance of polymers, with an eye toward the development of more sustainable materials capable of minimizing environmental impact. Through this exploration, it aims to provide valuable insights that contribute to the ongoing discourse on the optimization of polymer formulations for a greener future, setting the stage for innovations in material science aimed at sustainable applications. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to inform future research directions and material design strategies, ultimately supporting the creation of polymers that not only perform effectively but are also environmentally friendly. By integrating a thorough understanding of these relationships, this work aspires to lay the groundwork for the evolution of polymer science, encouraging advancements that align with both technological needs and ecological stewardship.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced softening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that elastomer enthalpic softening can instead emerge from a competition over preferred nonequilibrium volumes between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks. A theory for this competition accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>
