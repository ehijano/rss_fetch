      <title>On Resonance Enhancement of $E1-E2$ Nondipole Photoelectron Asymmetries in Low-Energy Ne $2p$-Photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earlier, a significant enhancement of the nondipole parameters $\gamma_{2p}$, $\delta_{2p}$, and $\zeta_{2p} = \gamma_{2p} + 3\delta_{2p}$ in the photoelectron angular distribution for Ne $2p$ photoionization, owing to resonance interference between dipole ($E1$) and quadrupole ($E2$) transitions, was predicted. This enhancement manifests as narrow resonance spikes in the parameters due to the low-energy $2s \rightarrow 3p$ and $2s \rightarrow 4p$ dipole, as well as the $2s \rightarrow 3d$ quadrupole autoionizing resonances. Given the unique nature of this predicted enhancement, it requires further validation. Specifically, whether these narrow spikes in $\gamma_{2p}$, $\delta_{2p}$, and $\zeta_{2p}$ will or will not retain their values for experimental observation if one accounts for a typical finite frequency spread in the ionizing radiation. To address this, we revisit the previous study, now incorporating the effect of frequency spread in the ionizing radiation, assuming a spread as large as $5$ meV at the half-maximum of the radiation's intensity. We demonstrate in the present paper that while the frequency spread does affect the resonance enhancement of $\gamma_{2p}$, $\delta_{2p}$, and $\zeta_{2p}$, these parameters still retain quantitatively significant values to be observed experimentally.
  The corresponding calculations were performed using the random phase approximation with exchange, which accounts for interchannel coupling in both dipole and quadrupole photoionization amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Room temperature buffer gas beam of metastable state titanium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce atomic beams of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in their metastable $3d^{3}(^4F){4}s$ $a^5F_5$ state by laser ablation into He, N$_2$, and Ar buffer gases. The high temperatures realized in the ablation process populate the $a^5F_5$ level without the need for optical pumping. Remarkably, we observe that Ti atoms in the $a^5F_5$ state survive $1000$'s of collisions with He and Ar buffer gas atoms without being quenched to lower-energy states. We study the yield of Ti atoms when ablated into buffer gases of varying species and pressure, quantify diffusion cross sections and quenching rates based on a simple model, and provide insight into optimal design parameters for an ablation cell. Using a 3.3$\,$cm ablation cell with interchangeable exit apertures, we produce metastable atom beams and quantify their brilliance and velocity distributions as functions of buffer gas pressure.</description>

      <title>Atom Camera: Super-resolution scanning microscope of a light pattern with a single ultracold atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-micrometer scale light patterns play a pivotal role in various fields, including biology, biophysics, and AMO physics. High-resolution, in situ observation of light profiles is essential for their design and application. However, current methods are constrained by limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, no existing techniques allow for super-resolution imaging of the polarization profile, which is critical for precise control of atomic and molecular quantum states. Here, we present an atom camera technique for in situ imaging of light patterns with a single ultracold atom held by an optical tweezers as a probe. By scanning the atom's position in steps of sub-micrometers and detecting the energy shift on the spin states, we reconstruct high-resolution 2D images of the light field. Leveraging the extraordinarily long coherence time and polarization-sensitive transitions in the spin structure of the atom, we achieve highly sensitive imaging both for intensity and polarization. We demonstrate this technique by characterizing the polarization in a tightly-focused beam, observing its unique non-trivial profile for the first time. The spatial resolution is limited only by the uncertainty of the atom's position, which we suppress down to the level of quantum fluctuations (~25 nm) in the tweezers' ground state. We thus obtain far better resolution than the optical diffraction limit, as well as than the previous ones obtained with a thermal atom fluctuating in the trap. This method enables the analysis and design of submicron-scale light patterns, providing a powerful tool for applications requiring precise light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy and frequency determination of the hyperfine components of the P(63) 4-4 transition of molecular iodine near 652 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of the hyperfine spectrum of the weak P(63)4-4 line of the B-X electronic transition of molecular iodine 127I2 near 652.4 nm, using frequency-modulated saturated absorption spectroscopy. Through the precise measurements of the absolute frequencies of hyperfine components, we estimate electric quadrupole and magnetic spin-rotation constants. Additionally, we determine the center of gravity of the P(63) transition of the 4-4 vibrational band, resulting in a 250-fold improvement in the precision of its position. We also note an interesting overlap of the hyperfine transitions of P(63)4-4 line with the UV 1S0-3P1 narrow intercombination transition of cadmium atoms, which occurs near the second harmonic of the master laser radiation, corresponding to 326.2 nm. This study contributes to updating the iodine atlas, improving the precision of the empirical formulae, and providing an important frequency reference for precision spectroscopy of the narrow intercombination transition of atomic cadmium.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of an attosecond pulse generation by a sub-cycle laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of sub-cycle driving fields on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), with a focus on intrinsic chirp, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and number of laser cycles. Our findings reveals that the center frequency of a laser pulse scales as $\tau^{-5/4}$ with pulse duration $\tau$, and that attochirp exhibits a similar dependence on pulse duration. Additionally, we identified CEP-specific trends in harmonic yield: it increases as $\tau^{5/4}$ for $\phi_0=0^\circ$ and decreases as $\tau^{-4.1}$ for $\phi_0= -90^\circ$. Although sub-cycle pulses can generate intense isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs), they also tend to produce higher attochirp and reduced cutoff energies. However, effective compensation for attochirp can mitigate these drawbacks, thereby increasing the capability of sub-cycle pulses to generate short-duration, high-intensity IAPs. These results offer valuable insights into HHG using sub-cycle pulses and have important implications for the advancement of ultrafast light sources and the understanding of ultrafast phenomena at the attosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum optical systems is determined by three key factors: the interactions with their surrounding environment, externally controlled lasers and between the different system components. Understanding the interplay between the three dynamical contributions is essential for the study of out-of-equilibrium phenomena as well as technological applications. The present study investigates open system phenomena in driven optical systems coupled simultaneously to a bosonic field. For a linear system of micro-cavities coupled to a photonic crystal, it is analytically shown that environmental interaction and external control cause significant non-Markovian corrections to the applied coherent drive. Additionally, collective cross-driving effects arise when multiple modes are coupled to the same field, where a laser applied to one mode effectively drives other modes. Based on the linear solution, a non-Markovian master equation for two-level emitters is derived. Remarkably, the proposed equation of motion remains accurate even for moderate driving intensities, where emitters cannot be approximated by bosonic modes. The influence of the non-linearity is analyzed and benchmarked against an exact pseudo-mode solution, and compared with established master equations in the Markovian regime. Within this regime, the comparison demonstrates the presence of short-time non-Markovian effects at times well beyond the inverse of the environment's bandwidth, and memory effects induced by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the driven open system dynamics of quantum optical systems, impurities embedded in solid-state materials, molecular systems, and more, paving the way for precise control of their quantum states.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals of the tipping point in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of tipping points is essential for prediction of collapses or other sudden changes in complex systems. Applications include studies of ecology, thermodynamics, climatology, and epidemiology. However, detecting early signs of proximity to a tipping is made challenging by complexity and non-linearity. Strongly interacting Rydberg atom gases offer model systems that offer both complexity and non-linearity, including phase transition and critical slowing down. Here, via an external probe we observe prior warning of the proximity of a phase transition of Rydberg thermal gases. This warning signal is manifested as a deviation from linear growth of the variance with increasing probe intensity. We also observed the dynamics of the critical slowing down behavior versus different time scales, and atomic densities, thus providing insights into the study of a Rydberg atom system's critical behavior. Our experiment suggests that the full critical slowing down dynamics of strongly-interacting Rydberg atoms can be probed systematically, thus providing a benchmark with which to identify critical phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.</description>
