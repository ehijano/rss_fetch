      <title>Ultrasonic spin pumping in the antiferromagnetic acoustic resonator $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in magnon spintronics have ignited interest in the interactions between the spin and elastic subsystems of magnetic materials. These interactions suggest a dynamic connection between collective excitations of spins, quantized as magnons, and elastic waves generated by perturbations in the crystal lattice, quantized as phonons. Both magnons and their associated magnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic materials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research has focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar investigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of generating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in antiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ at room temperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to strong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce significant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin accumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads to the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents arising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same methodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the resonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance in hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of times) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling the attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin pumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin pumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Pauli Propagation: A Computational Framework for Simulating Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical methods to simulate quantum systems are not only a key element of the physicist's toolkit for studying many-body models but are also increasingly important for verifying and challenging upcoming quantum computers. Pauli propagation has recently emerged as a promising new family of classical algorithms for simulating digital quantum systems. Here we provide a comprehensive account of Pauli propagation, tracing its algorithmic structure from its bit-level implementation and formulation as a tree-search problem, all the way to its high-level user applications for simulating quantum circuits and dynamics. Utilising these observations, we present PauliPropagation.jl, a Julia software package that can perform rapid Pauli propagation simulation straight out-of-the-box and can be used more generally as a building block for novel simulation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Systematic generation of electron models for Second-Principles Density Functional Theory Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic, quasi-automated methodology for generating electronic models in the framework of second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT). This approach enables the construction of accurate and computationally efficient models by deriving all necessary parameters from first-principles calculations on a carefully designed training set. A key feature of our method is the enforcement of space group symmetries, which reduces both the number of independent parameters and the required computational effort. The formalism includes improved treatments of one-electron Hamiltonians, electron-lattice coupling-through both linear and quadratic terms-and electron-electron interactions, enabling accurate modeling of structural and electronic responses. We apply the methodology to SrTiO$_{3}$ and LiF, materials representative of transition-metal perovskites and wide-band-gap insulators, respectively. In both cases, the resulting models reproduce DFT reference data with high fidelity across various atomic configurations and charge states. Our results validate the robustness of the approach and highlight its potential for simulating complex phenomena such as polarons and excitons. This work lays the foundation for extending SPDFT to real-time simulations of optoelectronic properties and further integration with machine-learning methods.</description>

      <title>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that unifies the understanding of spin splitting (SS) in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. Based on Dirac theory, we show that local electric multipoles coupled to magnetic moments govern SS across compensated magnets, leading to quadrupole-, dipole-, or monopole-driven regimes. Our model predicts momentum-dependent and momentum-independent SS, reconciling seemingly distinct phenomena such as altermagnetism and the spin Zeeman effect. This work establishes a general physical mechanism for SS beyond conventional Zeeman and Rashba paradigms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Diverse Topological States in Ge Doped MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an ideal platform for studying interplays between symmetry, topology and magnetism, the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) MnBi2Te4 has attracted extensive attentions. However, its strong n-type intrinsic defects hinder the realizations of exotic phenomena. Stimulated by recent discoveries that Ge doping can efficiently tune the position of Fermi level, here we systematically investigate the band evolution and topological phase diagram with doping concentration from MTI MnBi2Te4 to strong topological insulator GeBi2Te4. Different from magnetically doped Bi2Se3, the topology here is determined by competition of two band inversions arising from band folding of two time-reversal invariant momenta between antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic unit cells. By employing a band momentum mapping method, besides the known MTI phase, remarkably, we find two classes of magnetic Dirac semimetal phases at antiferromagnetic state, two classes of Weyl semimetal phases at ferromagnetic state, and an intermediate trivial state at different doping regions. Interestingly, the trivial state can be tuned into a Weyl phase with two coexisting band inversions and extraordinarily long Fermi arcs by a small strain. Our work reveals diverse topological states with intrinsic quantum phenomena can be achieved with great potential for designing future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>
