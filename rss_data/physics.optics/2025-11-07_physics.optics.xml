      <title>A quasi-bound band in the continuum in a photonic slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are localized waves in electronic, photonic and acoustic systems, which remain decoupled from surrounding propagating waves and hence maintain their oscillation for extraordinary long time [Nat Rev Mater 1, 16048 (2016)]. In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point. The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.</description>

      <title>A broadband silicon photonic-integrated-circuit based RF spectrum analyzer with 10 MHz spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing miniaturized optical spectrometers is an increasingly active area of research as spectrometers are crucial components for a wide range of applications including chemical and material analysis, medical diagnostics, classical and quantum sensing, characterization of light sources, and radio frequency (RF) spectrum analysis. Among these applications, designing on-chip spectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it requires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate. Existing chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF analysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad bandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric RF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to compensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz (0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the overall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by directing the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding the outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further reduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the RF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth of 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can support fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Single-shot near-field reconstruction of metamaterial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency surfaces of metamaterials in the microwave regime. In our approach, we excite resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe. Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast, reconfigurable all-optical beam steering and spatial light modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving spatiotemporal control of light at subwavelength and subcycle scales is an important milestone in the development of new photonic materials and technologies. Ultrafast spatiotemporal light modulation currently relies on electronic interband and intraband transitions that yield pronounced refractive index changes but typically suffer from slow, picosecond response times due to carrier relaxation. Here we show that by leveraging resonant light-matter interactions in a high-quality factor metasurface it is possible to use the optical Kerr effect, a weaker, but instantaneous optoelectronic polarization effect, to achieve ultrafast, reconfigurable light modulation with unprecedented spatial and temporal control. By the subwavelength all-optical tuning of the refractive index of the dielectric metasurface unit cells, we experimentally demonstrate pulse-limited beam steering with a 74-fs response time at angles up to $\pm $13{\deg} in the near-infrared. The steering originates from the Kerr effect with a background contribution arising from slower two-photon-excited free carrier absorption. Additionally, we observe spatial back-action, linear frequency conversion, and demonstrate arbitrary ultrafast spatial light modulation in two dimensions. Our findings open the possibility of realizing new ultrafast physics in metastructures with applications in signal processing, pulse shaping, and ultrafast imaging.</description>

      <title>Midinfrared Semiconductor Photonics - A Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor photonic devices operating in the midwave infrared (mid-IR, which we roughly define here as wavelengths spanning 3 to 14 microns) uniquely address a wide range of current practical needs. These include chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, industrial process control, medical diagnostics, thermal imaging, LIDAR, free space optical communication, and security monitoring. However, mid-IR device technologies are currently still works in progress that are generally much less mature than their near infrared and visible counterparts. Not only are most of the relevant materials more difficult to grow and process, but attainment of the desired optical device performance is often fundamentally more challenging. This Roadmap will review the leading applications for mid-IR optoelectronics, summarize the status and deficiencies of current device technologies, and then suggest possible roadmaps for improving and maturing the performance, manufacturability, and cost of each device type so the critical needs that are uniquely addressed by mid-IR photonics can be satisfied.</description>

      <title>Watt-level ultrafast 1.75 {\mu}m laser system based on thulium-doped core and terbium-doped cladding fluoride fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report watt-level femtosecond pulses in the 1.75 $\mu$m region using a thulium-doped core, terbium-doped cladding fluoride (Tm:Tb:ZBLAN) fiber laser system. The seed pulse is generated through stimulated Raman scattering in a silica fiber pumped by an erbium-doped fiber laser. The soliton is subsequently amplified through a multi-stage Tm:Tb:ZBLAN amplifier. The tunability of our chirped fiber Bragg grating stretcher, matched with a Treacy compressor, compresses the pulse to 217 fs. Our system generates ~250 nJ of single-pulse energy, with a corresponding average power of ~1 W at a 4 MHz repetition rate. The laser system is suitable for multiphoton microscopy.</description>

      <title>Raman-induced dynamics of ultrafast microresonator solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs are evolving towards octave-spanning for $f$-$2f$ self-referencing and expanding applications in spectroscopy and timekeeping. As spectra broaden and pulses shorten, the Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS) becomes a principal limitation: it reduces pump-to-comb conversion efficiency, constrains achievable span, and can, in extremes, preclude stationary operation. We develop a complementary theory of SSFS in microresonators that remains valid when the soliton duration $\tau_s$ is shorter than the Raman response timescale. The theory predicts a reduced dependence of the SSFS on $\tau_s$ which also expands the soliton existence range. Such predictions are validated by numerical simulations and by experiments on Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators. Our results provide practical guidelines for engineering efficient and broadband soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Transformer-Based Modeling of Nonlinear Pulse Evolution in Er-Doped Fiber Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural network model based on the Transformer architecture has been developed to predict the nonlinear evolution of optical pulses in Er-doped fiber amplifier under conditions of limited experimental data. To address data scarcity, a two-stage training strategy is employed. In the first stage, the model is pretrained on a synthetic dataset generated through numerical simulations of the amplifier's nonlinear dynamics. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned using a small set of experimental measurements. This approach enables accurate reproduction of the fine spectral structure of optical pulses observed in experiments across various nonlinear evolution regimes, including the development of modulational instability and the propagation of high-order solitons.</description>

      <title>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</description>

      <title>10-nm silicon nanostructures for phase-change UV-readable optical data storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving state-of-the-art optical data storage requires raising device capacity well above commercial standards. This requires media structured at a much smaller scale and enabling readout at a shorter wavelength. Current CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays are read with visible light, and are based on metallic reflection gratings and phase-change recording layers structured at the few-hundred-nm scale. Herein, we introduce 10-nm structured silicon as a promising UV-readable data storage platform. Recording on it harnesses the amorphous-to-crystalline phase-change of silicon, the two phases presenting well-constrasted UV optical properties. Furthermore, the phase-change contrast is strongly enhanced in the Vacuum UV thanks to the distinct interband plasmon resonances of the amorphous and crystalline nanostructures, which have an epsilon-near-zero and surface plasmonic character, respectively. Silicon nanogratings with a 10 nm width and a 20 nm period resonate near the wavelength of 120 nm, at which phase-change induces a 600% maximum optical transmittance contrast. This paves the way toward UV-readable data storage platforms with a 10 to 100 times increased data density, which could be implemented by harnessing the well-established silicon nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation in 2D nonlinear crystal integrated with meta-waveguide: analytical vs numerical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical theory of second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid structures combining a nonlinear 2D crystal with a dielectric metasurface waveguide. The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening, governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability, whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams. These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cathodoluminescence Enhancement Mechanisms in Silica Microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL) enables optical-frequency analysis of samples with nanometer resolutions, originating from the interaction of a focused electron beam with radiative electronic states, or directly with the optical modes of the sample. Here we decompose the various mechanisms underlying CL generation and emission from an archetype spherical resonator using its spectral, angular and spatially resolved features. We investigate radiation of optical whispering-gallery modes in regimes of coherent and incoherent luminescence. The use of different experimental regimes allows us to disentangle the different contributions to the CL in spheres, namely, photon absorption, generation and radiative leakage, and conclude that the photon generation occurs precisely on the sphere's surface. In addition, the spheres serve as high-NA collimating lenses for CL, resulting in mode quality unprecedented for CL in free space. We believe that such collimated and directed CL in free space will enhance existing quantum measurements of CL and facilitate new ones, such as high-rate electron-photon entangled pairs, CL from quantum emitters, and homodyne analysis of CL.</description>

      <title>Laboratory-based x-ray microtomography with directional dark-field sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate dark-field x-ray microtomography in a compact, laboratory-based system capable of resolving attenuation, phase, and anisotropic scattering signals with micrometer-scale resolution across centimetre-scale samples. The method is based on two-directional beam tracking (2DBT), which requires only a single optical element and is compatible with standard x-ray sources and detectors. We validate the system's capabilities through imaging of a custom-built phantom, a fibre-reinforced composite and ex-vivo biological tissues, including a bovine intervertebral disc, a rat heart, and a porcine meniscus. The results show that dark-field tomography provides complementary information to attenuation as well as to phase tomography, by revealing sub-resolution features such as fibre orientation and microstructural heterogeneity at length scales that are well below the voxel size. A key element of our system is its sensitivity to scattering along two orthogonal directions in the image plane, enabling the measurement of scattering anisotropy with a single exposure. As well as simple and robust, our approach is sensitive and precise. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2DBT for non-destructive and three-dimensional structural characterisation of samples and materials in engineering, materials science and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Universal in-line waveform characterization using arbitrary non-linear responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary schemes for waveform-resolved characterization are constrained by setup-specific requirements, which severely limits their adaptability and fails to establish standard procedures for routine in-line diagnostic. This work reports a comprehensive experimental demonstration that relative yield measurements from a broad variety of media and nonlinear observables, combined with our family of open-source reconstruction algorithms (CRIME and lazyCRIME), allow for robust waveform retrieval with attosecond accuracy on a standard workstation in just minutes. We have further adapted this framework to multiple configurations -- including non-invasive, simultaneous waveform characterization during an attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) experiment -- showcasing the low-cost and non-intrusive nature of the new pulse characterization approach. Together, this work establishes an easy-to-implement universal characterization scheme for in-line diagnostic of ultrashort pulses that is readily accessible to the broader ultrafast science community.</description>

      <title>Ion-Implanted Erbium in X-cut Thin-film Lithium Niobate: Luminescence and Low-Temperature Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a method for deterministic Er3+ doping of x-cut TFLN using focused ion beam (FIB) implantation with sub-100 nm spatial precision, enabling seamless integration of active rare-earth ions into this technologically relevant platform for lithium niobate integrated nanophotonics. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split 4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to 5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+ emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Compact and high-resolution spectrometer via Brillouin integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectrometers are indispensable tools across various fields, from chemical and biological sensing to astronomical observations and quantum technologies. However, the integration of spectrometers onto photonic chips has been hindered by the low spectral resolution or large device footprint with complex multiple channel operations. Here, we introduce a novel chip-integrated spectrometer by leveraging the acoustically-stimulated Brillouin scattering in a hybrid photonic-phononic chip. The Brillouin interaction provides a dynamic reflection grating with a high reflectivity up to 50% and a fast switching time on the microsecond scale, achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution of 0.56 nm over a 110 nm bandwidth using just a single 1 mm-long straight waveguide. This remarkable performance approaches the fundamental limit of resolution for a given device size, validating the potential of the hybrid photonic-phononic device for efficient and dynamically-reconfigurable spectral analysis, and thus opens up new avenues for advanced optical signal processing and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Portable, cost_effective UV_vis_NIR microspectrophotometer for absorption and fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes the design and construction of a portable, compact, and cost-effective microspectrophotometer (MSP) that operates in the range of (200_800 nm). This microscope spectrophotometer records highresolution absorption and emission spectra in situ. The dual head design of this MSP enables simultaneous real time imaging and spectral recording of heterogeneous samples with high selectivity and micrometer spatial resolution. Our compact, portable MSP design reduces construction costs by more than 20 times compared to commercial benchtop alternatives, primarily due to its innovative illumination system and microscope objective design. The performance of the UV_vis_NIR MSP was confirmed by comparing the absorption and fluorescence spectra of an aqueous solution of Ru(bpy) obtained with our system to those measured by commercial spectroscopic systems. The high accuracy and reliability of our system in measuring absorbance and fluorescence were confirmed by R squared values of 0.998 and 0.990, respectively, from colorimetric and fluorometric tests. The MSP was further used to record absorption and fluorescence spectra from a variety of samples, including dyes and protein crystals, in both the solution and solid state, as well as individual living cells. This compact instrument is ideal for rapid, in situ spectroscopic measurements and is expected to find on site applications across various fields, such as environmental monitoring, biological research, forensic analysis, and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Coherent Transport of Random Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive probability theory for coherent transport of random waves through arbitrary linear media. The transmissivity distribution for random coherent waves is a fundamental B-spline with knots at the transmission eigenvalues. We analyze the distribution's shape, bounds, moments, and asymptotic behaviors. In the large n limit, the distribution converges to a Gaussian whose mean and variance depend solely on those of the eigenvalues. This result resolves the apparent paradox between bimodal eigenvalue distribution and unimodal transmissivity distribution.</description>

      <title>Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition $L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the metal edges.</description>

      <title>Measuring non-Abelian quantum geometry and topology in a multi-gap photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of magnon-polaritons using an exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplitude of resonant oscillations in a non-Hermitian environment can either decay or grow in time, corresponding to a mode with either loss or gain. When two coupled modes have a specific difference between their loss or gain, a feature termed an exceptional point emerges in the excitations' energy manifold, at which both the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system coalesce. Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems due to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts including optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems, and have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the lasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A challenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully deterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on timescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the rapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic hybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to exploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an exceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled magnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of exceptional point encircling. We then study the effect of driving the system directly through an exceptional point, and demonstrate that this allows the coupled system to be prepared in an equal superposition of eigenmodes. We also show that the dynamics of the system at the exceptional point are dependent on its generalised eigenvectors. These results extend the established toolbox of adiabatic transfer techniques with a new approach for coherent state preparation, and provide a new avenue for exploring the dynamical properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Controlled growth of rare-earth-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films on III-V semiconductors for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging is emerging as a transformative approach for biomedical applications, applying nonclassical properties of light, such as entanglement, squeezing, and quantum correlations, to overcome fundamental limits of conventional techniques. These methods promise superior spatial resolution, enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, improved phase sensitivity, and reduced radiation dose, for potentially safer and more precise imaging for delicate biological samples. Here, we present an overview of quantum optical biomedical imaging technologies as well as quantum-inspired imaging methods, including quantum optical coherence tomography, quantum optical microscopy, ghost imaging, multi-parameter quantum imaging, and imaging with quantum-grade cameras. We describe the operating principles, biomedical applications, and unique advantages of each approach, along with the specific challenges for their translation into real-life practice. This review aims to guide future research toward advancing quantum imaging from experimental demonstrations to impactful biomedical tools.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS image sensor platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over the commercially available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (CIS) platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>$\mu$NeuFMT: Optical-Property-Adaptive Fluorescence Molecular Tomography via Implicit Neural Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction, eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth). Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically, we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future wearable devices.</description>

Abstract: Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and produce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however, process raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As a result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their visual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information content, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not quantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific aspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with performance on secondary tasks.
  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly quantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By fitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics, our method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying gradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique for designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system performance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL matched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the prevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing algorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal performance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally efficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.

      <title>Giant near-field nonlinear electrophotonic effects in an angstrom-scale plasmonic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) fundamentally limits the bandwidth available for quantum information processing. Despite its importance, no prior experiment has systematically examined how driving detuning affects the indistinguishability of photons scattered from a TLE - a parameter critical for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (&lt;=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) &lt; 0.5.</description>

      <title>General theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two- and higher-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, systems can exhibit geometry-dependent bands, where the spectrum and eigenstates under open boundary conditions depend on the bulk geometry even in the thermodynamic limit. Although geometry-dependent bands are widely observed, the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we address this problem by establishing a higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory based on the concept of "strip generalized Brillouin zones" (SGBZs), which describe the asymptotic behavior of non-Hermitian bands when a lattice is extended sequentially along its linearly independent axes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that geometry-dependent bands arise from the incompatibility of SGBZs and, for the first time, derive a general criterion for the geometry dependence of non-Hermitian bands: non-zero area of the complex energy spectrum or the imaginary momentum spectrum. Our work opens an avenue for future studies on the interplay between geometric effects and non-Hermitian physics, such as non-Hermitian band topology.</description>
