      <title>Cut-off phenomenon and asymptotic mixing for multivariate general linear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The small noise cut-off phenomenon in continuous time and space has been studied in the recent literature for the linear and non-linear stable Langevin dynamics with additive L\'evy drivers - understood as abrupt thermalization of the system along a particular time scale to its dynamical equilibrium - both for the total variation distance and the Wasserstein distance. The main result of this article establishes sufficient conditions for the window and profile cut-off phenomenon, which are flexible enough to cover the renormalized (non-Markovian) Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process driven by fractional Brownian motion and a large class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian, homogeneous and non-homogeneous drivers with (possible) finite second moments. The sufficient conditions are stated both for the total variation distance and the Wasserstein distance. Important examples are the multidimensional fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the empirical sampling process of a fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes driven by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and the inhomogeneous Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process arising in simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic typical distances in preferential attachment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the typical distances in a preferential attachment model with out-degree $m\geq 2$ and strictly positive fitness parameter are close to $\log_\nu{n}$, where $\nu$ is the exponential growth parameter of the local limit of the preferential attachment model. The proof relies on a path-counting technique, the first- and second-moment methods, as well as a novel proof of the convergence of the spectral radius of the offspring operator under a certain truncation.</description>

      <title>Hitting k primes by dice rolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S=(d_1,d_2,d_3, \ldots )$ be an infinite sequence of rolls of independent fair dice. For an integer $k \geq 1$, let $L_k=L_k(S)$ be the smallest $i$ so that there are $k$ integers $j \leq i$ for which $\sum_{t=1}^j d_t$ is a prime. Therefore, $L_k$ is the random variable whose value is the number of dice rolls required until the accumulated sum equals a prime $k$ times. It is known that the expected value of $L_1$ is close to $2.43$. Here we show that for large $k$, the expected value of $L_k$ is $(1+o(1)) k\log_e k$, where the $o(1)$-term tends to zero as $k$ tends to infinity. We also include some computational results about the distribution of $L_k$ for $k \leq 100$.</description>

      <title>Spectral heat content for non-isotropic L\'evy processes with weak lower scaling condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the small-time asymptotic behavior of symmetric, but not necessarily isotropic, L\'evy processes with weak lower scaling condition near zero on its L\'evy density. Our main result, Theorem 2.1, extends and generalizes key findings in \cite{KP24} and \cite{PS22} by encompassing non-isotropic L\'evy processes and providing a unified proof that includes the critical case in which the one-dimensional projection of the underlying processes is non-integrable. In particular, the main result recovers \cite[Theorem 1.1]{PS22} for both $\alpha\in (1,2)$ and $\alpha=1$ cases and provide a robust proof that can be applied to study the small-time asymptotic behavior of the spectral heat content for other interesting examples discussed in Section 4.</description>

      <title>Generalized delayed Black and Scholes Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean objective of this paper is to derive an explicit formula for a price of an European option associated to the underlying delayed stock price which follows a linear differential equation with a general delay in the drift term. We use an equivalent martingale measure method based on Girsanov's property. Two of our model maintains the no-arbitrage property and the completeness of the market and can be considered as an extension some previous model introduced by Arriojas et al. in \cite{Aal}. The last one has a possible arbitrage property such that we can not obtain an unique price of an European option associated.</description>

      <title>Exploring the phase transition of planar FK-percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of these notes is to give a quick introduction to FK-percolation, focusing on certain recent results about the phase transition of the two dimensional model, namely its continuity or discontinuity depending on the cluster weight $q$, and the asymptotic rotational invariance of the critical phase (when the phase transition is continuous). As such, the main focus is on FK-percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ with $q \geq 1$, but we do mention some important results valid for general dimension. To favour quick access to recent results, the style is minimal, with certain proofs omitted or left as exercises.</description>

      <title>A spatial host-parasite model with host immunity: Survival and linear spread of parasites on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the frog model to describe the invasion of a parasite population in a spatially structured immobile host population with host immunity on the integer line. Parasites move according to simple symmetric random walks and try to infect any host they meet. Hosts, however, own an immunity against the parasites that protects them from infection for a random number of attacks. Once a host gets infected, it and the infecting parasite die, and a random number of offspring parasites is generated. We show that the positivity of the survival probability of parasites only depends on the mean offspring and mean height of immunity. Furthermore, we prove through the construction of a renewal structure that given survival of the parasite population parasites invade the host population at linear speed under relatively mild assumptions on the host immunity distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The right tail asymptotic series consisting of attenuating exponential terms are derived for the densities of Galton-Watson processes with fractional probability generating functions. The frequencies in the exponential factors form fractal structures in the complex plane. We discuss conditions when the asymptotic series converges everywhere. The obtained right tail asymptotic is compared with the standard integral representation of the density and with the complete left tail asymptotic.</description>

      <title>Biased random walk on the critical curve of dynamical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study biased random walks on dynamical percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, which were recently introduced by Andres et al. We provide a second order expansion for the asymptotic speed and show for $d \ge 2$ that the speed of the biased random walk on the critical curve is eventually monotone increasing. Our methods are based on studying the environment seen from the walker as well as a combination of ergodicity and several couplings arguments.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for a spatial host-parasite model with extreme host immunities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}_d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model of a parasite population invading spatially distributed immobile hosts. Each host has an unbreakable immunity against infection with a certain probability $p$. We show that, on $\Z^d$ with $d\ge 2$ and the $d$-regular tree $\mathbb{T}_d$ with $d\ge 3$, the survival probability of parasites undergoes a phase transition in the probability $p$ of a host to be immune. Also we show that on vertex-transitive graphs a fixed vertex is only visited finitely often by a parasite almost surely under mild assumptions on the parasites offspring distribution.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (DAmbrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel method combines a particle filter with reduced variance and solving the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space, exploiting the advantages of both approaches. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Trend-encoded Probabilistic Multi-order Model: A Non-Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Stock Market Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the dominance of machine learning in stock market forecasting has been evident. While these models have shown decreasing prediction errors, their robustness across different datasets has been a concern. A successful stock market prediction model minimizes prediction errors and showcases robustness across various data sets, indicating superior forecasting performance. This study introduces a novel multiple lag order probabilistic model based on trend encoding (TeMoP) that enhances stock market predictions through a probabilistic approach. Results across different stock indexes from nine countries demonstrate that the TeMoP outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning models in predicting accuracy and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic intersection theory in Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M=G/H$ be a Riemannian homogeneous space, where $G$ is a compact Lie group with closed subgroup $H$. Classical intersection theory states that the de Rham cohomology ring of $M$ describes the signed count of intersection points of submanifolds $Y_1, \ldots, Y_s$ of $M$ in general position, when the codimensions add up to $\dim M$.
  We introduce the probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$, whose multiplication describes the unsigned count of intersection points, when the $Y_i$ are randomly moved by independent uniformly random elements of $G$. The probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ has the structure of a graded commutative and associative real Banach algebra. It is defined as a quotient of the ring of Grassmann zonoids of a fixed cotangent space $V$ of $M$. The latter was introduced by the authors in [Adv. Math. 402, 2022]. There is a close connection to valuations of convex bodies: $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ can be interpreted as a subspace of the space of translation invariant, even, continuous valuations on $V$, whose multiplication coincides with Alesker's multiplication for smooth valuations.
  We describe the ring structure of the probabilistic intersection ring for spheres, real projective space and complex projective space, relying on Fu [J. Diff. Geo. 72(3), 2006] for the latter case. From this, we derive an interesting probabilistic intersection formula in complex projective space. Finally, we initiate the investigation of the probabilistic intersection ring for real Grassmannians, outlining the construction of a probabilistic version of Schubert Calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling in the so-called low-temperature regime, which is typically characterised by non-local behaviour and strong global correlations. Canonical examples include sampling independent sets on bipartite graphs and sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model. Low-temperature sampling is computationally intractable for general graphs, but recent advances based on the polymer method have made significant progress for graph families that exhibit certain expansion properties that reinforce the correlations, including for example expanders, lattices and dense graphs.
  One of the most natural graph classes that has so far escaped this algorithmic framework is the class of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs whose expansion only manifests for sufficiently large subsets of vertices; small sets of vertices on the other hand have vanishing expansion which makes them behave independently from the bulk of the graph and therefore weakens the correlations. At a more technical level, the expansion of small sets is crucial for establishing the Kotecky-Priess condition which underpins the applicability of the framework.
  Our main contribution is to develop the polymer method in the low-temperature regime for sparse random graphs. As our running example, we use the Potts and random-cluster models on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d=\Theta(1)$, where we show a polynomial-time sampling algorithm for all sufficiently large $q$ and $d$, at all temperatures. Our approach applies more generally for models that are monotone. Key to our result is a simple polymer definition that blends easily with the connectivity properties of the graph and allows us to show that polymers have size at most $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Optimal network geometry detection for weak geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network geometry, characterized by nodes with associated latent variables, is a fundamental feature of real-world networks. Still, when only the network edges are given, it may be difficult to assess whether the network contains an underlying source of geometry. This paper investigates the limits of geometry detection in networks in a wide class of models that contain geometry and power-law degrees, which include the popular hyperbolic random graph model. We specifically focus on the regime in which the geometric signal is weak, characterized by the inverse temperature $1/T&lt;1$. We show that the dependencies between edges can be tackled through Mixed-Integer Linear Problems, which lift the non-linear nature of network analysis into an exponential space in which simple linear optimization techniques can be employed. This approach allows us to investigate which subgraph and degree-based statistic is most effective at detecting the presence of an underlying geometric space. Interestingly, we show that even when the geometric effect is extremely weak, our Mixed-Integer programming identifies a network statistic that efficiently distinguishes geometric and non-geometric networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Risk Scores for Continuous Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Optimization formulation to construct a risk score, where we optimize the logistic loss with sparsity constraints. Previous approaches are typically designed to handle binary datasets, where continuous predictor variables are discretized in a preprocessing step by using arbitrary thresholds, such as quantiles. In contrast, we allow the model to decide for each continuous predictor variable the particular threshold that is critical for prediction. The usefulness of the resulting optimization problem is tested in synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Minimum stationary values of sparse random directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationary distribution of the simple random walk on the directed configuration model with bounded degrees. Provided that the minimum out-degree is at least $2$, with high probability (whp) there is a unique stationary distribution. We show that the minimum positive stationary value is whp $n^{-(1+C+o(1))}$ for some constant $C \ge 0$ determined by the degree distribution. In particular, $C$ is the competing combination of two factors: (1) the contribution of atypically "thin" in-neighbourhoods, controlled by subcritical branching processes; and (2) the contribution of atypically "light" trajectories, controlled by large deviation rate functions. Additionally, our proof implies that whp the hitting and the cover time are both $n^{1+C+o(1)}$. Our results complement those of Caputo and Quattropani who showed that if the minimum in-degree is at least 2, stationary values have logarithmic fluctuations around $n^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new random permutation model that generalizes the $k$-card minimum model defined by Travers and the Mallows model. We calculate the permuton limit of such a sequence of random permutations. As a corollary, we deduce the law of large numbers for pattern densities. Moreover, we prove a universality result about the band structure of the limiting permuton, confirming a conjecture of Travers about the $k$-card minimum model. More specifically, we show that if a certain model parameter goes to infinity then the appropriately scaled restriction of the permuton measure to a line that intersects the diagonal perpendicularly converges weakly to the logistic distribution.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <title>The probability that a random triple of dice is transitive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $n$-sided die is an $n$-tuple of positive integers. We say that a die $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ beats a die $(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ if the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $a_i&gt;b_j$ is greater than the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $a_i&lt;b_j$. We show that for a natural model of random $n$-sided dice, if $A, B$ and $C$ are three random dice then the probability that $A$ beats $C$ given that $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$ is approximately 1/2. In other words, the information that $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$ has almost no effect on the probability that $A$ beats $C$. This proves a statement that was conjectured by Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu and Morrison for a different model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limit laws for ergodic averages with a power singularity over circle rotations were first proved by Sinai and Ulcigrai, as well as Dolgopyat and Fayad. In this paper, we prove limit laws with an estimate for the rate of convergence for the sum $\sum_{n=1}^N f(n \alpha)/n^p$ in terms of a $1$-periodic function $f$ with a power singularity of order $p \ge 1$ at integers. Our results apply in particular to cotangent sums related to Dedekind sums, and to sums of reciprocals of fractional parts, which appear in multiplicative Diophantine approximation. The main tools are Schmidt's method in metric Diophantine approximation, the Gauss-Kuzmin problem and the theory of $\psi$-mixing random variables.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a large class of shallow neural networks with randomly initialized parameters and rectified linear unit activation functions. We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent 3/2. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a compounded random walk that is physically well defined on both finite and infinite domains, and samples space-dependent forces throughout jumps. The governing evolution equation for the walk limits to a space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation valid on bounded domains, and recovers the well known superdiffusive space-fractional diffusion equation on infinite domains. We describe methods for numerical approximation and Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate excellent correspondence with analytical solutions. This compounded random walk, and its associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation, provides a major advance for modeling space-fractional diffusion through potential fields and on finite domains.</description>

Abstract: We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a sufficiently large $d_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $d\ge d_0$, whp the random $d$-regular graph $G(n,d)$ contains a $T$-factor for every tree $T$ on at most $(1-\epsilon)d/\ln d$ vertices. This is best possible since, for large enough integer $d$, whp $G(n,d)$ does not contain a $\frac{(1+\epsilon)d}{\ln d}$-star-factor. Our method gives a randomised algorithm which whp finds said $T$-factor and whose expected running time is $O(n^{1+o(1)})$, as well as an efficient deterministic counterpart.</description>

Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>
