      <title>On relative integral monodromy of abelian logarithms and normal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative algebraic monodromy of abelian logarithms (defined as the kernel of a map between algebraic monodromy groups attached to an abelian scheme with and without a section) was computed in \cite{A1}: under natural assumptions, this vector group turns out to be maximal.
  The relative integral monodromy of abelian logarithms is defined similarly as a kernel of integral monodromy groups, without taking Zariski closures. We show that if the integral monodromy of the abelian scheme is a lattice in the algebraic monodromy (which is not always the case), then the relative integral monodromy of the abelian logarithm is also a lattice in the relative algebraic monodromy. The proof uses a Hodge-theoretic interpretation of sections of abelian schemes.
  We also consider relative integral monodromy groups in the more general context of normal functions.</description>

      <title>Large genus asymptotics of super Weil-Petersson volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic expansions of super intersection numbers and prove that the associated coefficients are polynomials. Moreover, we give an algorithm which can explicitly compute these coefficients. As an application, we prove the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of super Weil-Petersson volumes in the large genus. This generalizes the celebrated work of Mirzakhani-Zograf. We also confirm two conjectural formulae proposed by Griguolo-Papalini-Russo-Seminara.</description>

      <title>On singular supports in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fix an excellent regular noetherian scheme $S$ over ${\mathbf Z}_{(p)}$ satisfying a certain finiteness condition. For a constructible \'etale sheaf ${\cal F}$ on a regular scheme $X$ of finite type over $S$, we introduce a variant of the singular support relatively to $S$ and prove the existence of a saturated relative variant of the singular support by adopting the method of Beilinson using the Radon transform. We may deduce the existence of the singular support itself, if we admit an expected property on the micro support of tensor product and if the scheme $X$ is sufficiently ramified over the base $S$.</description>

      <title>Taking the amplituhedron to the limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplituhedron is a semialgebraic set given as the image of the non-negative Grassmannian under a linear map subject to a choice of additional parameters. We define the limit amplituhedron as the limit of amplituhedra by sending one of the parameters, namely the number of particles $n$, to infinity. We study this limit amplituhedron for $m = 2$ and any $k$, relating to the number of negative helcity particles. We determine its algebraic boundary in terms of Chow hypersurfaces. This hypersurface in the Grassmannian is stratified by singularities in terms of higher order secants of the rational normal curve. In conclusion, we show that the limit amplituhedron is a positive geometry with a residual arrangement that is empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conditions for topological and bi-Lipschitz equivalences within a class of mixed singularities of Pham-Brieskorn type. We then derive the construction of topologically trivial infinite families with distinct bi-Lipschitz types. We also investigate the same problem applied to the mixed surfaces defined by these singularities in the two complex variables case and deduce conditions for inner, outer, and ambient bi-Lipschitz equivalences.</description>

      <title>Relating flat connections and polylogarithms on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</description>

      <title>Rational points on the non-split Cartan modular curve of level 27 and quadratic Chabauty over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to work of Rouse, Sutherland, and Zureick-Brown, it is known exactly which subgroups of GL$_2(\mathbf{Z}_3)$ can occur as the image of the $3$-adic Galois representation attached to a non-CM elliptic curve over $\mathbf{Q}$, with a single exception: the normaliser of the non-split Cartan subgroup of level 27. In this paper, we complete the classification of 3-adic Galois images by showing that the normaliser of the non-split Cartan subgroup of level 27 cannot occur as a 3-adic Galois image of a non-CM elliptic curve.
  Our proof proceeds via computing the $\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3)$-rational points on a certain smooth plane quartic curve $X'_H$ (arising as a quotient of the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(27)$) defined over $\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3)$ whose Jacobian has Mordell--Weil rank 6. To this end, we describe how to carry out the quadratic Chabauty method for a modular curve $X$ defined over a number field $F$, which, when applicable, determines a finite subset of $X(F\otimes\mathbf{Q}_p)$ in certain situations of larger Mordell--Weil rank than previously considered. Together with an analysis of local heights above 3, we apply this quadratic Chabauty method to determine $X'_H(\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3))$. This allows us to compute the set $X_{ns}^+(27)(\mathbf{Q})$, finishing the classification of 3-adic images of Galois.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, a spacefilling brane structure is a closed 2-form $F$ which determines a complex structure, with respect to which $F +i\omega$ is holomorphic symplectic. For holomorphic symplectic compact K\"ahler 4-manifolds, we show that the moduli space of spacefilling branes is smooth, and determine its dimension. The proof relies on the local Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces and tori.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>A finiteness result towards the Casas-Alvero Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Casas-Alvero conjecture predicts that every univariate polynomial over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero sharing a common factor with each of its Hasse-Schmidt derivatives is a power of a linear polynomial. The conjecture for polynomials of a fixed degree is equivalent to the projective variety of such polynomials being one-dimensional. In this paper, we show that for any algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, this variety is at most two-dimensional for all positive degrees. Consequently, we show that the associated arithmetic Casas-Alvero scheme in any positive degree has finitely many rational points over any field. Along the way, we prove several rigidity results towards the conjecture. We also introduce intermediate arithmetic Casas-Alvero schemes and show that their $\mathbb{K}$ points form an almost complete intersection over any algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. Furthermore, we consider the question of when they form a complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Vafa-Witten invariants from exceptional collections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.14466v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric D-branes supported on the complex two-dimensional base $S$ of the local Calabi-Yau threefold $K_S$ are described by semi-stable coherent sheaves on $S$. Under suitable conditions, the BPS indices counting these objects (known as generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants) coincide with the Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$ (which encode the Betti numbers of the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves). For surfaces which admit a strong collection of exceptional sheaves, we develop a general method for computing these invariants by exploiting the isomorphism between the derived category of coherent sheaves and the derived category of representations of a suitable quiver with potential $(Q,W)$ constructed from the exceptional collection. We spell out the dictionary between the Chern class $\gamma$ and polarization $J$ on $S$ vs. the dimension vector $\vec N$ and stability parameters $\vec\zeta$ on the quiver side. For all examples that we consider, which include all del Pezzo and Hirzebruch surfaces, we find that the BPS indices $\Omega_\star(\gamma)$ at the attractor point (or self-stability condition) vanish, except for dimension vectors corresponding to simple representations and pure D0-branes. This opens up the possibility to compute the BPS indices in any chamber using either the flow tree or the Coulomb branch formula. In all cases we find precise agreement with independent computations of Vafa-Witten invariants based on wall-crossing and blow-up formulae. This agreement suggests that i) generating functions of DT invariants for a large class of quivers coming from strong exceptional collections are mock modular functions of higher depth and ii) non-trivial single-centered black holes and scaling solutions do not exist quantum mechanically in such local Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ring R is said to be rigid if the only locally nilpotent derivation of R is the zero derivation. Let G be an abelian group, and B = (direct sum of B_i for i in G) be a G-graded commutative integral domain of characteristic 0. For each subgroup H of G, consider the Veronese subring B(H) of B, defined by B(H) = (direct sum of the B_i for i in H). We study the following questions. If B is non-rigid, does it follow that B(H) is non-rigid? Can derivations of B(H) be extended to derivations of B? What are the properties of the set of subgroups H of G such that B(H) is non-rigid?</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_m$ be points in a metric space with distance $d$, and let $w_1,\ldots,w_m$ be positive real weights. The weighted Fermat-Weber points are those points $\mathbf{x}$ which minimize $\sum w_i d(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{x})$. We extend a result of Com\u{a}neci and Joswig, that the set of unweighted Fermat-Weber points agrees with the "central" covector cell of the tropical convex hull of $\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_m$, to the weighted setting. In particular, we show that for any fixed data points $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_m$, and any covector cell of the tropical convex hull of the data, there is a choice of weights that makes that cell the Fermat-Weber set. We similarly extend the method of Com\u{a}neci and Joswig for computing consensus trees in phylogenetics.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>Geometric-combinatorial approaches to tilting theory for weighted projective lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a geometric-combinatorial model for the category of coherent sheaves on the weighted projective line of type (2,2,n) via a cylindrical surface with n marked points on each of its upper and lower boundaries, equipped with an order 2 self-homeomorphism. A bijection is established between indecomposable sheaves on the weighted projective line and skew-curves on the surface. Moreover, by defining a skew-arc as a self-compatible skew-curve and a pseudo-triangulation as a maximal set of distinct pairwise compatible skew-arcs, we show that pseudo-triangulations correspond bijectively to tilting sheaves. Under this bijection, the flip of a skew-arc within a pseudo-triangulation coincides with the tilting mutation. As an application, we prove the connectivity of the tilting graph for the category of coherent sheaves.</description>
