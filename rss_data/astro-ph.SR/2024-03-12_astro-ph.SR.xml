      <title>The Asteroseismic Imprints of Mass Transfer: A Case Study of a Binary Mass Gainer in the SPB Instability Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new simulations investigating the impact of mass transfer on the asteroseismic signals of slowly pulsating B stars. We use MESA to simulate the evolution of a binary star system and GYRE to compute the asteroseismic properties of the accretor star. We show that, compared to a single star of the same final mass, a star that has undergone accretion (of non-enriched material) has a significantly different internal structure, evident in both the hydrogen abundance profile and Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency profile. These differences result in significant changes in the observed period spacing patterns, implying that one may use this as a diagnostic to test whether a star's core has been rejuvenated as a result of accretion. We show that it is essential to consider the full multimodal posterior distributions when fitting stellar properties of mass-gainers to avoid drawing misleading conclusions. Even with these considerations, stellar ages will be significantly underestimated when assuming single star evolution for a mass-gainer. We find that future detectors with improved uncertainties would rule out single star models with the correct mass and central hydrogen fraction. Our proof of principle analysis demonstrates the need to further investigate the impact of binary interactions on stellar asteroseismic signals for a wide range of parameters, such as initial mass, amount of mass transferred and the age of the accretor star at the onset of mass transfer.</description>

      <title>The Hertzsprung progression of Classical Cepheids in the Gaia era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new fine grid of nonlinear convective pulsation models for the so-called "bump Cepheids" is presented to investigate the Hertzprung progression (HP) phenomenon shown by their light and radial pulsation velocity curves. The period corresponding to the center of the HP is investigated as a function of various model assumptions, such as the efficiency of super-adiabatic convection, the mass-luminosity relation, and the metal and helium abundances. The assumed mass-luminosity relation is found to significantly affect the phenomenon but variations in the chemical composition as well as in the stellar mass (at fixed mass-luminosity relation) also play a key role in determining the value of the HP center period. Finally, the predictive capability of the presented theoretical scenario is tested against observed light curves of bump Cepheids in the ESA Gaia database, also considering the variation of the pulsation amplitudes and of the Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $\Phi_{21}$ with the pulsation period. A qualitative agreement between theory and observations is found for what concerns the evolution of the light curve morphology as the period moves across the HP center, as well for the pattern in period-amplitude, period-$R21$ and period-$\Phi_{21}$ planes. A larger sample of observed Cepheids with accurate light curves and metallicities is required in order to derive more quantitative conclusions.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current that produced these Langmuir waves is estimated from the Generalized Ohms law to be ~15 microamps/m2 and, from the strahl, 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves, acting as antennas, produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 6.28*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through the huge density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Soft X-ray Spectra of Solar Flare Onsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we present the analysis of six solar flare events that occurred in 2022, using new data from the third-generation Miniature X-Ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS), also known as the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS). The primary focus of this study is on the flare's "onset phase", which is characterized by elevated soft X-ray emissions even before the flare's impulsive phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and elemental abundance factors during the flare onset phase, by fitting the DAXSS spectra with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) model. The model fitting results indicate that the flaring-plasma is already at a high temperature (10-15 MK) during the onset period. The temperature rises during the onset phase, followed by a decrease and subsequent increase during the impulsive phase. Elemental abundance factors show a trend of falling below pre-flare values during the onset phase, with some recovery before the impulsive phase. During the impulsive phase, the abundance factors decrease from elevated coronal values to about photospheric values. We also analyze images from the 193 Angstrom channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), highlighting the formation or brightening of coronal loop structures during the onset phase. Two distinct onset loop configurations are observed which are referred to as 1-loop and 2-loop onsets. Both DAXSS and AIA observations indicate that the flare onset phase exhibits similar hot coronal plasma properties as the impulsive phase, suggesting that the onset phase may act as a preconditioning effect for some flares.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the solar cycle variability using nonlinear time series analysis at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is not highly supercritical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar dynamo is essentially a cyclic process in which the toroidal component of the magnetic field is converted into the poloidal one and vice versa. This cyclic loop is disturbed by some nonlinear and stochastic processes mainly operating in the toroidal to poloidal part. Hence, the memory of the polar field decreases in every cycle. On the other hand, the dynamo efficiency and, thus, the supercriticality of the dynamo decreases with the Sun's age. Previous studies have shown that the memory of the polar magnetic field decreases with the increase of supercriticality of the dynamo. In this study, we employ popular techniques of time series analysis, namely, compute Higuchi's fractal dimension, Hurst exponent, and Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, to the amplitude of the solar magnetic cycle obtained from dynamo models operating at near-critical and supercritical regimes. We show that the magnetic field in the near-critical regime is governed by strong memory, less stochasticity, intermittency, and breakdown of self-similarity. On the contrary, the magnetic field in the supercritical region has less memory, strong stochasticity, and shows a good amount of self-similarity. Finally, applying the same time series analysis techniques in the reconstructed sunspot data of 85 cycles and comparing their results with that from models, we conclude that the solar dynamo is possibly operating near the critical regime and not too much supercritical regime. Thus Sun may not be too far from the critical dynamo transition.</description>

      <title>Cyclic variations of the structure and energetics of solar magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar cycle is a complex phenomenon, a comprehensive understanding of which requires the study of various tracers. Here, we consider the solar cycle as manifested in the harmonics of the solar large-scale surface magnetic field, including zonal, sectorial and tesseral harmonics, divided into odd and even relative to the solar equator. In addition to considering the amplitudes of the harmonics, we analyze their contribution to the magnetic energy. It turns out that the relative contribution of different types of harmonics to the magnetic energy is virtually independent of the cycle height. We identify different phases of the activity cycle using harmonics of different symmetries. A possible way to incorporate the obtained result into the solar dynamo theory is proposed.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in close orbits as Gravitational Wave Sources: Formation Scenarios and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Searches for Evolutionary Orbital Period Changes in WR+OB Binaries: the Case of WR 127 (Hen 3-1772)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at searching for secular evolution of the orbital period in the short-period binary system WR 127 (WN3b+O9.5V, $P = 9.555^d$). We performed new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of WR 127 on 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope to construct the radial velocity curves of the components suggesting the component masses $M_\mathrm{WR}\sin^3(i) = 11.8\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{O}\sin^3(i)=17.2\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$. The comparison with archival radial velocity curves enabled us to calculate the $(O-C)$ plot with accuracy sufficient to search for the orbital period change in WR 127. We report on the reliable detection of a secular increase in the orbital period of WR 127 at a rate of $\dot{P} = 0.83\pm0.14~\mbox{s~yr}^{-1}$ corresponding to the dynamical mass-loss rate from the WR star $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WR} = (2.6\pm0.5)\times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass-loss rate from WR stars in three WR+OB binaries (WR 127, CX Cep and V444 Cyg) as inferred from spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggests a preliminary empirical correlation between the WR star mass and the dynamical mass-loss rate $\dot M_\mathrm{WR}\sim M_\mathrm{WR}^{1.8}$. This relation is important for the understanding of the evolution of massive close binaries with WR stars -- precursors of gravitational-wave binary merging events with neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>The influence of different coronal hole geometries on simulations of coronal wave - coronal hole interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of a coronal hole (CH) affects the density profile of the reflected part of an incoming global coronal wave (CW). In this study, we perform for the first time magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of fast-mode MHD waves interacting with CHs of different geometries, such as circular, elliptic, convex, and concave shapes. We analyse the influence these geometries have on the density profiles of the reflected waves and we generate the corresponding simulation-based time-distance plots. Within these time-distance plots we determine regions that exhibit specific density features, such as large reflected density amplitudes. In a further step, these interaction features can be compared to actual observed CW-CH interaction events which makes it possible to explain interaction parameters from the observed interaction events, such as the density structure of the reflected wave, which are usually difficult to comprehensively understand by only analysing the measurements. Moreover, we show that the interaction between a concave shaped CH and CWs, whose density profile include an enhanced as well as a depleted wave, can lead to reflected density amplitudes that are more than two times larger than the incoming ones. Another effect of the interplay between the constructive and destructive interference of the reflected wave parts is a strongly depleted region in the middle of the CW-CH interaction process. In addition, we show how important the choice of the path is that is used to generate the time-distance plots and how this choice affects the interpretation of the CW-CH interaction results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady 3D MHD simulations of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate time integration scheme to solve the particle trajectories. Diffusion in velocity space, given a particle-turbulence mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$ along the magnetic field, is also included. Preliminary results for $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and mean free path $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$ are in a good qualitative agreement with measurements at 1 AU.</description>

      <title>Identifying plasma fractionation processes in the chromosphere using IRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of the solar corona differs from that of the photosphere, with the plasma thought to fractionate in the solar chromosphere according to the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) of the different elements. This produces a FIP bias, wherein elements with a low FIP are preferentially enhanced in the corona compared to their photospheric abundance, but direct observations of this process remain elusive. Here we use a series of spectroscopic observations of Active Region AR 12759 as it transited the solar disc over a period of 6 days from 2-7 April 2020 taken using the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instruments to look for signatures of plasma fractionation in the solar chromosphere. Using the Si X/S X and Ca XIV/Ar XIV diagnostics, we find distinct differences between the FIP bias of the leading and following polarities of the active region. The widths of the IRIS Si IV lines exhibited clear differences between the leading and following polarity regions, indicating increased unresolved wave activity in the following polarity region compared to the leading polarity region, with the chromospheric velocities derived using the Mg II lines exhibiting comparable, albeit much weaker, behaviour. These results are consistent with plasma fractionation via resonant/non-resonant waves at different locations in the solar chromosphere following the ponderomotive force model, and indicate that IRIS could be used to further study this fundamental physical process.</description>

      <title>The MODEST catalog of depth-dependent spatially coupled inversions of sunspots observed by Hinode/SOT-SP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog that we named MODEST containing depth-dependent information on the atmospheric conditions inside sunspot groups of all types. The catalog is currently composed of 942 observations of 117 individual active regions with sunspots that cover all types of features observed in the solar photosphere. We use the SPINOR-2D code to perform spatially coupled inversions of the Stokes profiles observed by Hinode/SOT-SP at high spatial resolution. SPINOR-2D accounts for the unavoidable degradation of the spatial information due to the point spread function of the telescope. The sunspot sample focuses on complex sunspot groups, but simple sunspots are also part of the catalog for completeness. Sunspots were observed from 2006 to 2019, covering parts of solar cycles 23 and 24. The catalog is a living resource, as with time, more sunspot groups will be included.</description>

      <title>Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes, and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict, but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.</description>

      <title>Fast Methods for Computing Photometric Variability of Eccentric Binaries: Boosting, Lensing, and Variable Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze accretion-rate time series for equal-mass binaries in co-planar gaseous disks spanning a continuous range of orbital eccentricities up to 0.8, for both prograde and retrograde systems. The dominant variability timescales match that of previous investigations; the binary orbital period is dominant for prograde binaries with $e \gtrsim 0.1$, with a 5 times longer "lump" period taking over for $e\lesssim 0.1$. This lump period fades and drops from 5 times to 4.5 times the binary period as $e$ approaches 0.1, where it vanishes. For retrograde orbits, the binary orbital period dominates at $e \lesssim 0.55$ and is accompanied by a 2 times longer-timescale periodicity at higher eccentricities. The shape of the accretion-rate time series varies with binary eccentricity. For prograde systems, the orientation of an eccentric disk causes periodic trading of accretion between the binary components in a ratio that we report as a function of binary eccentricity. We present a publicly available tool, binlite, that can rapidly ($\lesssim 0.01$~sec) generate templates for the accretion-rate time series, onto either binary component, for choice of binary eccentricity below 0.8. As an example use-case, we build lightcurve models where the accretion rate through the circumbinary disk and onto each binary component sets contributions to the emitted specific flux. We combine these rest-frame, accretion-variability lightcurves with observer-dependent Doppler boosting and binary self-lensing. This allows a flexible approach to generating lightcurves over a wide range of binary and observer parameter space.

      <title>Discovery of a Rare Eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary System, Swift J010902.6-723710 = SXP 182</title>

Abstract: We report on the discovery of Swift J010902.6-723710, a rare eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary system by the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). Swift J010902.6-723710 was discovered via weekly S-CUBED monitoring observations when it was observed to enter a state of X-ray outburst on 10 October 2023. X-ray emission was found to be modulated by a 182s period. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the presence of a highly-inclined circumstellar disk surrounding a B0-0.5Ve optical companion. Historical UV and IR photometry are then used to identify strong eclipse-like features re-occurring in both light curves with a 60.623 day period, which is adopted as the orbital period of the system. Eclipsing behavior is found to be the result of a large accretion disk surrounding the neutron star. Eclipses are produced when the disk passes in front of the OBe companion, blocking light from both the stellar surface and circumstellar disk. This is only the third Be/X-ray Binary to have confirmed eclipses. We note that this rare behavior provides an important opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of a Be/X-ray Binary with greater accuracy than is possible in non-eclipsing systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and a comet has been observed several times by in-situ observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), which is designed to investigate the cometary magnetosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG). Goetz et al. (2019) reported a magnetic field of up to 300 nT measured in the inner coma, which is among the largest interplanetary magnetic fields observed in the solar system. They suggested the large magnetic field observations in the inner coma come from magnetic field pile-up regions, which are generated by the interaction between a CME and/or corotating interaction region and the cometary magnetosphere. However, the detailed interaction between a CME and the cometary magnetosphere of comet CG in the inner coma has not been investigated by numerical simulations yet. In this manuscript, we will use a numerical model to simulate the interaction between comet CG and a Halloween class CME and investigate its magnetospheric response to the CME. We find that the plasma structures change significantly during the CME event, and the maximum value of the magnetic field strength is more than 500nT close to the nucleus. Virtual satellites at similar distances as Rosetta show that the magnetic field strength can be as large as 250nT, which is slightly less than what Goetz et al. (2019) reported.</description>

      <title>Flares during Eclipses of High Mass X-ray Binary Systems Vela X-1, 4U 1700-37, and LMC X-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In eclipsing X-ray binary systems, the direct X-ray emission is blocked by the companion star during the eclipse. We observe only reprocessed emission that contains clues about the environment of the compact object and its chemical composition, ionization levels, etc. We have found flares in some X-ray binaries during their eclipses. The study of eclipse flares provides additional clues regarding the size of the reprocessing region and helps distinguish between different components of the X-ray spectrum observed during the eclipse. In the archival data, we searched for flares during eclipses of high-mass X-ray binaries and found flares in three sources: Vela X-1, LMC X-4, and 4U 1700-37. Comparing spectral properties of the eclipse flare and non-flare data, we found changes in the power-law photon index in all three sources and multiple emission lines in Vela X-1 and 4U 1700-37. The fluxes of prominent emission lines showed a similar increase as the overall X-ray flux during the eclipse flare, suggesting the lines originate in the binary environment and not in the interstellar medium. We also observed a soft excess in 4U 1700-37 that remains unchanged during both eclipse flare and non-flare states. Our analysis suggests that this emission originates from the extremely thin shell of the stellar wind surrounding the photosphere of its companion star. The detection of short (100-200 seconds) count-rate doubling timescale in 4U 1700-37 and LMC X-4 indicates that the eclipse reprocessing occurs in a region larger than, but comparable to the size of the companion star.</description>

      <title>ROME/REA: Three-year, Tri-color Timeseries Photometry of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ROME/REA (Robotic Observations of Microlensing Events/Reactive Event Assessment) Survey was a Key Project at Las Cumbres Observatory (hereafter LCO) which continuously monitored 20 selected fields (3.76 sq.deg.) in the Galactic Bulge throughout their seasonal visibility window over a three-year period, between March 2017 and March 2020. Observations were made in three optical passbands (SDSS-g', -r', -i'), and LCO's multi-site telescope network enabled the survey to achieve a typical cadence of $\sim$10\,hrs in i' and ~15 hrs in g' and r'. In addition, intervals of higher cadence (&lt;1 hr) data were obtained during monitoring of key microlensing events within the fields. This paper describes the Difference Image Analysis data reduction pipeline developed to process these data, and the process for combining the photometry from LCO's three observing sites in the Southern Hemisphere. The full timeseries photometry for all 8 million stars, down to a limiting magnitude of i~18 mag is provided in the data release accompanying this paper, and samples of the data are presented for exemplar microlensing events, illustrating how the tri-band data are used to derive constraints on the microlensing source star parameters, a necessary step in determining the physical properties of the lensing object. The timeseries data also enables a wealth of additional science, for example in characterizing long-timescale stellar variability, and a few examples of the data for known variables are presented.</description>

      <title>TOI-1173 A $b$: The First Inflated Super-Neptune in a Wide Binary System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among Neptunian mass planets exoplanets ($20-50$ M$_\oplus$), puffy hot Neptunes are extremely rare, and their unique combination of low mass and extended radii implies very low density ($\rho &lt; 0.3$ g cm$^{-3}$). Over the last decade, only a few puffy planets have been detected and precisely characterized with both transit and radial velocity observations, most notably including WASP-107 $b$, TOI-1420 $b$, and WASP-193 $b$. In this paper, we report the discovery of TOI-1173 A $b$, a low-density ($\rho = 0.269_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$) super-Neptune with $P = 7.06$ days in a nearly circular orbit around the primary G-dwarf star in the wide binary system TOI-1173 A/B. Using radial velocity observations with the MAROON-X spectrograph and transit photometry from TESS, we determined a planet mass of $M_{\rm{p}} = 26.1\pm1.9\ M_{\oplus}$ and radius of $R_{\rm{p}} = 8.10\pm0.17\ R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1173 A $b$ is the first puffy Super-Neptune planet detected in a wide binary system (separation $\sim 11,400$ AU). We explored several mechanisms to understand the puffy nature of TOI-1173 A $b$, and showed that tidal heating is the most promising explanation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TOI-1173 A $b$ likely has maintained its orbital stability over time and may have undergone von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration followed by tidal circularization given its present-day architecture, with important implications for planet migration theory and induced engulfment into the host star. Further investigation of the atmosphere of TOI-1173 A $b$ will shed light on the origin of close-in low-density Neptunian planets in field and binary systems, while spin-orbit analyses may elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO Molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Velocity fields of molecular clouds (MCs) can provide crucial information on the merger and split between clouds, as well as their internal kinematics and maintenance, energy injection and redistribution, even star formation within clouds. Using the CO spectral lines data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, we measure the relative velocities along the line of sight ($\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$) between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO MCs. Emphasizing MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures, we find that approximately 70$\%$ of $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ values are less than $\sim$ 1 km s$^{-1}$, and roughly 10$\%$ of values exceed 2 km s$^{-1}$, with a maximum of $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ with the internal velocity dispersion of $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$) and find that about 40$\%$ of samples in either double or triple regime display distinct velocity discontinuities, i.e. the relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures are larger than the internal linewidths of $^{13}$CO structures. Among these 40$\%$ samples in the triple regime, 33$\%$ exhibit signatures of combinations through the two-body motion, whereas the remaining 7$\%$ show features of configurations through the multiple-body motion. The $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ distributions for MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures are similar, as well as their $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$ distributions. This suggests that relative motions of $^{13}$CO structures within MCs are random and independent of cloud complexities and scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present point-source photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope's final survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We mapped 30 square degrees in two epochs in 2017, with the second extending to early 2018 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns using the Infrared Array Camera. This survey duplicates the footprint from the SAGE-SMC program in 2008. Together, these surveys cover a nearly 10 yr temporal baseline in the SMC. We performed aperture photometry on the mosaicked maps produced from the new data. We did not use any prior catalogs as inputs for the extractor in order to be sensitive to any moving objects (e.g., foreground brown dwarfs) and other transient phenomena (e.g., cataclysmic variables or FU Ori-type eruptions). We produced a point-source catalog with high-confidence sources for each epoch as well as combined-epoch catalog. For each epoch and the combined-epoch data, we also produced a more complete archive with lower-confidence sources. All of these data products will be available to the community at the Infrared Science Archive.</description>

      <title>Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST: I. Strategy and First Results of Dusty Stellar Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging survey of I Zw 18, the archetypal extremely metal-poor, star-forming, blue compact dwarf galaxy. With an oxygen abundance of only $\sim$3% $Z_{\odot}$, it is among the lowest-metallicity systems known in the local universe, and is, therefore, an excellent accessible analog for the galactic building blocks which existed at early epochs of ionization and star formation. These JWST data provide a comprehensive infrared (IR) view of I Zw 18 with eight filters utilizing both NIRCam (F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W) and MIRI (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F1800W) photometry, which we have used to identify key stellar populations that are bright in the near- and mid-IR. These data allow for a better understanding of the origins of dust and dust-production mechanisms in metal-poor environments by characterizing the population of massive, evolved stars in the red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. In addition, it enables the identification of the brightest dust-enshrouded young stellar objects (YSOs), which provide insight into the formation of massive stars at extremely low metallicities typical of the very early universe. This paper provides an overview of the observational strategy and data processing, and presents first science results, including identifications of dusty AGB star, RSG, and bright YSO candidates. These first results assess the scientific quality of JWST data and provide a guide for obtaining and interpreting future observations of the dusty and evolved stars inhabiting compact dwarf star-forming galaxies in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of solar microflares in accelerating electrons when rooted in a sunspot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two microflares of GOES classes A9 and C1 (after background subtraction) observed by STIX onboard Solar Orbiter with exceptionally strong nonthermal emission. We complement the hard X-ray imaging and spectral analysis by STIX with co-temporal observations in the (E)UV and visual range by AIA and HMI, in order to investigate what makes these microflares so sufficient in high-energy particle acceleration. We performed case studies of two microflares observed by STIX on October 11, 2021 and November 10, 2022 that showed unusually hard microflare X-ray spectra with power-law indices of the electron flux distributions delta = 2.98 and delta = 4.08 during their nonthermal peaks and photon energies up to 76 keV and 50 keV respectively. For both events under study, we found that one footpoint is located within a sunspot covering areas with mean magnetic flux densities in excess of 1500 G, suggesting that the hard electron spectra are caused by the strong magnetic fields in which the flare loops are rooted. In addition, we revisited the unusually hard RHESSI microflare initially published by Hannah et al. (2008b) and found that in this event also one flare kernel was located within a sunspot, which corroborates the result from the two hard STIX microflares under study. We conclude that the characteristics of the strong photospheric magnetic fields inside sunspot umbrae and penumbrae where the flare loops are rooted play an important role in the generation of exceptionally hard X-ray spectra in these microflares.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Charge States and Abundances with Nonthermal Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are about 10-30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.</description>

      <title>89 New Ultracool Dwarf Co-Moving Companions Identified With The Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the identification of 89 new systems containing ultracool dwarf companions to main sequence stars and white dwarfs, using the citizen science project Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 and cross-reference between Gaia and CatWISE2020. Thirty-two of these companions and thirty-three host stars were followed up with spectroscopic observations, with companion spectral types ranging from M7-T9 and host spectral types ranging from G2-M9. These systems exhibit diverse characteristics, from young to old ages, blue to very red spectral morphologies, potential membership to known young moving groups, and evidence of spectral binarity in 9 companions. Twenty of the host stars in our sample show evidence for higher order multiplicity, with an additional 11 host stars being resolved binaries themselves. We compare this sample's characteristics with those of the known stellar binary and exoplanet populations, and find our sample begins to fill in the gap between directly imaged exoplanets and stellary binaries on mass ratio-binding energy plots. With this study, we increase the population of ultracool dwarf companions to FGK stars by $\sim$42\%, and more than triple the known population of ultracool dwarf companions with separations larger than 1,000 au, providing excellent targets for future atmospheric retrievals.</description>

      <title>X-ray diagnostics of Cassiopeia A's "Green Monster": evidence for dense shocked circumstellar plasma</title>

Abstract: The recent survey of the core-collapse supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (CasA) with the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a large structure in the interior region, referred to as the "Green Monster". Although its location suggests that it is an ejecta structure, the infrared properties of the "Green Monster" hint at a circumstellar medium (CSM) origin. In this companion paper to the JWST Cas A paper, we investigate the filamentary X-ray structures associated with the "Green Monster" using Chandra X-ray Observatory data. We extracted spectra along the "Green Monster" as well as from shocked CSM regions. Both the extracted spectra and a principal component analysis show that the "Green Monster" emission properties are similar to those of the shocked CSM. The spectra are well-fit by a model consisting of a combination of a non- equilibrium-ionization model and a power-law component, modified by Galactic absorption. All the "Green Monster" spectra show a blueshift corresponding to a radial velocity of around -2300 km/s, suggesting that the structure is on the near side of Cas A. The ionization age is around $n_{e}t = 1.5 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}s. This translates into a pre-shock density of ~12 cm$^{-3}$, higher than previous estimates of the unshocked CSM. The relatively high net and relatively low radial velocity suggest that this structure has a relatively high density compared to other shocked CSM plasma. This analysis provides yet another piece of evidence that the CSM around Cas A's progenitor was not that of a smooth steady wind profile.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field of gas giant exoplanets and its influence on the retention of their exomoons</title>

Abstract: We study the magnetic and tidal interactions of a gas-giant exoplanet with its host star and with its exomoons, and focus on their retention. We briefly revisit the scaling law for planetary dynamo in terms of its mass, radius and luminosity. Based on the virial theorem, we construct an evolution law for planetary magnetic field and find that its initial entropy is important for the field evolution of a high-mass planet. We estimate the magnetic torques on orbit arising from the star-planet and planet-moon magnetic interactions, and find that it can compensate tidal torques and bypass frequency valleys where dynamical-tide response is ineffective. For exomoon's retention we consider two situations. In the presence of a circumplanetary disk (CPD), by comparison between CPD's inner and outer radii, we find that planets with too strong magnetic fields or too small distance from its host star tend not to host exomoons. During the subsequent CPD-free evolution, we find, by comparison between planet's spindown and moon's migration timescales, that hot Jupiters with periods of several days are unlikely to retain large exomoons, albeit they could be surrounded by rings from the debris of tidally disrupted moons. In contrast, moons, if formed around warm or cold Jupiters, can be preserved. Finally, we estimate the radio power and flux density due to the star-planet and planet-moon magnetic interactions and give the upper limit of detection distance by FAST.</description>

      <title>Workshop on the limiting compactness objects: Black holes and Buchdahl stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15543</link>

Abstract: The workshop was organized at IUCAA on Oct 30 - Nov 3, 2023 as a compact discussion and discourse meeting with a threadbare exposition and discussion of the various aspects and the questions arising. It was occasioned by the visit of Professor Hakan Andreasson of the Gothenburg Technical University, Sweden. He has been exploring with his collaborators the Einstein - Vlasov system for over a decade and a half as a possible matter source for compact objects. This system characterizes itself by free particles in motion and interacting only through gravity. For a limiting compactness, this may be the most appropriate state. The main thrust of the workshop was to understand this new object, Buchdahl Star (BS), of limiting compactness without a horizon. It is almost as compact as a black hole (BH) and yet has no horizon and hence is open for interaction with the outside world. Ever since the proposal of the membrane paradigm envisaging a timelike fiducial surface near BH horizon, BS offers an excellent possibility of the existence of such a real astrophysical object. It could very well compete with BH as a mimicker for various physical and astrophysical phenomena. Thus, it opens up a new vista of study and investigation of all the questions that one asks for BH, for this new creature, BS. The workshop was intended to identify certain interesting questions as well as the people interested in studying them. On this count, the workshop has been a huge success as several interesting questions have been identified, a few groups have been formed to take up different problems, and the work has already started. Nothing more could one have asked from such an exercise. A brief summary of some of the talks is included, followed by a brief discussion of the projects identified as a result of the discussions during the workshop.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Population III Stars to Merging Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.</description>
