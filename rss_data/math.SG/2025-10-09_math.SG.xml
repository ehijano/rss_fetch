      <title>Low-dimensional topology and symplectic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are notes to accompany my lectures at the $2024$ "Current Developments in Mathematics" conference hosted by Harvard/MIT. The lectures were about some recent progress in our understanding of two and three dimensional dynamical systems, using in part some tools from low-dimensional topology. In these notes, I try to give a sense for how this works by discussing a few examples from problems I have worked on and surveying some related developments. Some symplectic variants of Weyl's law play a key role. I also briefly comment on some other developments and on the relationship with what is known in higher dimensions. The lectures themselves are available online.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.</description>
