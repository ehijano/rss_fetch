      <title>Belief System Dynamics as Network of Single Layered Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As problems in political polarization and the spread of misinformation become serious, belief propagation on a social network becomes an important question to explore. Previous breakthroughs have been made in algorithmic approaches to understanding how group consensus or polarization can occur in a population. This paper proposed a modified model of the Friedkin-Johnsen model that tries to explain the underlying stubbornness of individual as well as possible back fire effect by treating each individual as a single layer neural network on a set of evidence for a particular statement with input being confidence level on each evidence, and belief of the statement is the output of this neural network.
  In this papar, we reafirmed the importance of Madison's cure for the mischief of faction, and found that when structure of understanding is polarized, a network with a giant component can decrease the variance in the belief distribution more than a network with two communities, but creates more social pressure by doing so. We also found that when community structure is formed, variance in the belief distribution become less sensitive to confidence level of individuals. The model can have various applications to political and historical problems caused by misinfomation and conflicting economic interest as well as applications to personality theory and behavior psychology.</description>

      <title>D-Tracker: Modeling Interest Diffusion in Social Activity Tensor Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples' interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic: it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations.

      <title>Avatar Communication Provides More Efficient Online Social Support Than Text Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communication via avatars provides a richer online social experience than text communication. This reinforces the importance of online social support. Online social support is effective for people who lack social resources because of the anonymity of online communities. We aimed to understand online social support via avatars and their social relationships to provide better social support to avatar users. Therefore, we administered a questionnaire to three avatar communication service users (Second Life, ZEPETO, and Pigg Party) and three text communication service users (Facebook, X, and Instagram) (N=8,947). There was no duplication of users for each service. By comparing avatar and text communication users, we examined the amount of online social support, stability of online relationships, and the relationships between online social support and offline social resources (e.g., offline social support). We observed that avatar communication service users received more online social support, had more stable relationships, and had fewer offline social resources than text communication service users. However, the positive association between online and offline social support for avatar communication users was more substantial than for text communication users. These findings highlight the significance of realistic online communication experiences through avatars, including nonverbal and real-time interactions with co-presence. The findings also highlighted avatar communication service users' problems in the physical world, such as the lack of offline social resources. This study suggests that enhancing online social support through avatars can address these issues. This could help resolve social resource problems, both online and offline in future metaverse societies.</description>

      <title>Reducing Sexual Predation and Victimization Through Warnings and Awareness among High-Risk Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online sexual predators target children by building trust, creating dependency, and arranging meetings for sexual purposes. This poses a significant challenge for online communication platforms that strive to monitor and remove such content and terminate predators' accounts. However, these platforms can only take such actions if sexual predators explicitly violate the terms of service, not during the initial stages of relationship-building. This study designed and evaluated a strategy to prevent sexual predation and victimization by delivering warnings and raising awareness among high-risk individuals based on the routine activity theory in criminal psychology. We identified high-risk users as those with a high probability of committing or being subjected to violations, using a machine learning model that analyzed social networks and monitoring data from the platform. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on a Japanese avatar-based communication application, Pigg Party. High-risk players in the intervention group received warnings and awareness-building messages, while those in the control group did not receive the messages, regardless of their risk level. The trial involved 12,842 high-risk players in the intervention group and 12,844 in the control group for 138 days. The intervention successfully reduced violations and being violated among women for 12 weeks, although the impact on men was limited. These findings contribute to efforts to combat online sexual abuse and advance understanding of criminal psychology.</description>

      <title>Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S. congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and important extensions of our analysis.</description>

      <title>S3AND: Efficient Subgraph Similarity Search Under Aggregated Neighbor Difference Semantics (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the past decades, the \textit{subgraph similarity search} over a large-scale data graph has become increasingly important and crucial in many real-world applications, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics network analytics, knowledge graph discovery, and many others. While previous works on subgraph similarity search used various graph similarity metrics such as the graph isomorphism, graph edit distance, and so on, in this paper, we propose a novel problem, namely \textit{subgraph similarity search under aggregated neighbor difference semantics} (S$^3$AND), which identifies subgraphs $g$ in a data graph $G$ that are similar to a given query graph $q$ by considering both keywords and graph structures (under new keyword/structural matching semantics). To efficiently tackle the S$^3$AND problem, we design two effective pruning methods, \textit{keyword set} and \textit{aggregated neighbor difference lower bound pruning}, which rule out false alarms of candidate vertices/subgraphs to reduce the S$^3$AND search space. Furthermore, we construct an effective indexing mechanism to facilitate our proposed efficient S$^3$AND query answering algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our S$^3$AND approach over both real and synthetic graphs under various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Bridging Cultural and Digital Divides: A Low-Latency JackTrip Framework for Equitable Music Education in the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of digital technologies has transformed educational landscapes worldwide, yet significant infrastructural and cultural challenges persist in the Global South. This paper introduces a low-latency JackTrip framework designed to bridge both the cultural and digital divides in music education. By leveraging an open-source, UDP-based audio streaming protocol originally developed at Stanford's CCRMA, the framework is tailored to address technical constraints such as intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and high latency that characterize many rural and underserved regions. The study systematically compares the performance of JackTrip with conventional platforms like Zoom, demonstrating that JackTrip achieves sub-30~ms latency under simulated low-resource conditions while preserving the intricate audio details essential for non-Western musical traditions. Spectral analysis confirms that JackTrip's superior handling of microtonal scales, complex rhythms, and harmonic textures provides a culturally authentic medium for real-time ensemble performance and music education. These findings underscore the transformative potential of decentralized, edge-computing solutions in empowering educators and musicians across the Global South, promoting both technological equity and cultural preservation.</description>

      <title>A new sociology of humans and machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From fake social media accounts and generative artificial intelligence chatbots to trading algorithms and self-driving vehicles, robots, bots and algorithms are proliferating and permeating our communication channels, social interactions, economic transactions and transportation arteries. Networks of multiple interdependent and interacting humans and intelligent machines constitute complex social systems for which the collective outcomes cannot be deduced from either human or machine behaviour alone. Under this paradigm, we review recent research and identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion and collective decision-making, with context-rich examples from high-frequency trading markets, a social media platform, an open collaboration community and a discussion forum. To ensure more robust and resilient human-machine communities, we require a new sociology of humans and machines. Researchers should study these communities using complex system methods; engineers should explicitly design artificial intelligence for human-machine and machine-machine interactions; and regulators should govern the ecological diversity and social co-development of humans and machines.</description>

      <title>The illusion of households as entities in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data recording connections between people in communities and villages are collected and analyzed in various ways, most often as either networks of individuals or as networks of households. These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network -- from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data.</description>

      <title>Omitted Labels Induce Nontransitive Paradoxes in Causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human experts or specific, focused studies. By studying Simpson's paradox, we observe that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. A generalization of Simpson's paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises. We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop efficient and effective strategies for the update of Katz centralities after node and edge removal in simple graphs. We provide explicit formulas for the ``loss of walks" a network suffers when nodes/edges are removed, and use these to inform our algorithms. The theory builds on the newly introduced concept of $\cF$-avoiding first-passage walks. Further, bounds on the change of total network communicability are also derived. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks complement our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Recovering Small Communities in the Planted Partition Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze community recovery in the planted partition model (PPM) in regimes where the number of communities is arbitrarily large. We examine the three standard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak recovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or alignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a predicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using the correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions. We then demonstrate that $\textit{Diamond Percolation}$, an algorithm based on common-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on edge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of communities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes follow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in real-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first recovery results for such unbalanced partitions.</description>

      <title>How Cohesive Are Community Search Results on Online Social Networks?: An Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous community search methods for large graphs have been proposed, at the core of which is defining and measuring cohesion. This paper experimentally evaluates the effectiveness of these community search algorithms w.r.t. cohesiveness in the context of online social networks. Social communities are formed and developed under the influence of group cohesion theory, which has been extensively studied in social psychology. However, current generic methods typically measure cohesiveness using structural or attribute-based approaches and overlook domain-specific concepts such as group cohesion. We introduce five novel psychology-informed cohesiveness measures, based on the concept of group cohesion from social psychology, and propose a novel framework called CHASE for evaluating eight representative community search algorithms w.r.t. these measures on online social networks. Our analysis reveals that there is no clear correlation between structural and psychological cohesiveness, and no algorithm effectively identifies psychologically cohesive communities in online social networks. This study provides new insights that could guide the development of future community search methods.</description>
