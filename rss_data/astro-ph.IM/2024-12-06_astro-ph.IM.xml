      <title>Picture Perfect: Photometric Transient Classification Using the ParSNIP Model with Roman Hourglass Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4 meter primary mirror and optical--NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core Community Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will measure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this number with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically classified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate transient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) framework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman HLTDS. This study leverages this Roman Hourglass dataset to train and evaluate the ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ this model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying particular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe Ia, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model performance is assessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift ranges. Our analysis reveals that while the model performs robustly at higher redshifts (with the AUC for classification varying between 0.9 and 0.95 in the range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2), its accuracy dips at the lowest redshifts of the survey, likely due to limited training data. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring adequate representation of classes in the training set. This work underscores the value of machine learning models for next-generation surveys, paving the way for future studies with the Roman Space Telescope for survey optimization, cosmological forecasts, and synergies with other surveys.</description>

      <title>Image-Constrained Modeling with Hubble and Keck Images Reveals that OGLE-2012-BLG-0563Lb is a Jupiter-Mass planet Orbiting a K Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution imaging from the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} combined with adaptive optics imaging results from the {\sl Keck}-II telescope to determine the mass of the OGLE-2012-BLG-0563L host star and planet to be $M_{\rm host} = 0.801\pm 0.033M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm planet} = 1.116 \pm 0.087 M_{\rm Jupiter}$, respectively, located at a distance of $D_L = 5.46\pm 0.56\,$kpc. There is a close-wide degeneracy in the light curve models that indicates star-planet projected separation of $1.50\pm 0.16\,$AU for the close model and $8.41\pm 0.87\,$AU for the wide model. We used the image-constrained modeling method to analyze the light curve data with constraints from this high angular resolution image analysis. This revealed systematic errors in some of the ground-based light curve photometry that led to an estimate of the angular Einstein Radius, $\theta_E$, that was too large by a factor of $\sim 2$. The host star mass is a factor of 2.4 larger than the value presented in the \citet{fukui15} discovery paper. Although most systematic photometry errors seen in ground-based microlensing light curve photometry will not be repeated in data from the {\sl Roman Space Telescope}'s Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, we argue that image constrained modeling will be a valuable method to identify possible systematic errors in {\sl Roman} photometry.</description>

      <title>MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase gas, with hot ($\sim10^6$K) and cold ($\sim10^4$K) gas, is ubiquitous in astrophysical media across a wide range of scales. However, simulating multiphase gas has been a long-standing challenge, due to the large separation between the size of cold gas structures and the scales at which such gas impacts the evolution of associated systems. In this study, we introduce a new subgrid framework for such multiphase gas, MOGLI: Model for Multiphase Gas using Multifluid hydrodynamics, in multifluid AREPO. We develop this approach based on first principles and theoretical results from previous studies with resolved small-scale simulations, leading to a minimal number of free parameters in the formulation. We divide the interactions in the model into three sources: drag, turbulent mixing and cold gas growth. As part of the model, we also include two methods for estimating the local turbulent velocities, one using the Kolmogorov scaling, and the other using the local velocity gradients. We verify the different components of the framework through extensive comparison with benchmark single-fluid simulations across different simulation parameters, such as how resolved the cold gas is initially, the turbulent Mach number, spatial resolution, and random initialisation of turbulence. We test the complete scheme and a reduced version, with and without cold gas growth. We find a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement across the different simulation parameters and diagnostics for both local turbulent velocity estimation methods. We also reproduce behaviour like the cold gas survival criteria as an emergent property. We discuss the applications and possible extensions of MOGLI and demonstrate its capability by running a simulation which would be computationally prohibitive to run as a resolved single-fluid simulation.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging of three accelerating stars using SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam at LBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.</description>

      <title>No evidence of magma ocean on Io based on Juno/JIRAM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper (ref. 1) used infrared images of Io acquired by the Juno/JIRAM instrument to derive a latitudinal dependence of the spectral radiance and conclude that such latitudinal dependence is consistent with a magma ocean model. We challenge their conclusions, and we draw attention to some potential issues with their analysis. In this letter, we will use three arguments to show that: (1) the (ref. 1) paper uses saturated data; (2) the M-filter of the JIRAM imager is only a weak and incomplete proxy for the total power output; and finally (3) even assuming that the radiance was correctly estimated, the latitudinal dependence of the 4.8-$\mu$m spectral radiance is not statistically significant. These facts, taken together, demonstrate that the results presented in (ref. 1) are not sufficient to confirm consistency with a magma ocean model on Io.</description>

      <title>DARWEN: Data-driven Algorithm for Reduction of Wide Exoplanetary Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet atmospheric modeling is advancing from chemically diverse one-dimensional (1D) models to three-dimensional (3D) global circulation models (GCMs), which are crucial for interpreting observations from facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). However, maintaining chemical diversity in models, especially in GCMs, is computationally expensive, limiting their complexity. Optimizing the number of reactions and species can address this tradeoff, but transparent and efficient methods for such optimization are lacking in current exoplanet literature. We aim to develop a systematic approach for reducing chemical networks in exoplanetary atmospheres while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our data-driven method selects optimal reduced chemical networks based on accuracy and computational efficiency metrics. This approach can optimize networks for similar planets simultaneously, assign weights to prioritize accuracy or efficiency, and is applicable when including photochemistry. We base our method on sensitivity analysis of a typical 1D chemical kinetics model, applying principal component analysis to the sensitivities. To achieve fast and reliable network reduction, we utilize a genetic algorithm, a machine-learning optimization method that mimics natural selection. We present three schemes tailored for different priorities (accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to photochemistry) that demonstrate improved performance and reduced computational costs. Our genetic algorithm-based method, the first to reduce a chemical network including photochemistry in exoplanet research, offers a versatile and efficient approach to enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Systematic Effects Using the Inferred Initial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employ the Simulator Expansion for Likelihood-Free Inference (SELFI) algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilise to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of N-body simulations. Second, we obtain a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we rely on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full-forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.</description>

      <title>Processing of GASKAP-HI pilot survey data using a commercial supercomputer</title>

Abstract: Modern radio telescopes generate large amounts of data, with the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) expected to feed up to 292 GB of visibilities per second to the science data processor (SDP). However, the continued exponential growth in the power of the world's largest supercomputers suggests that for the foreseeable future there will be sufficient capacity available to provide for astronomers' needs in processing 'science ready' products from the new generation of telescopes, with commercial platforms becoming an option for overflow capacity. The purpose of the current work is to trial the use of commercial high performance computing (HPC) for a large scale processing task in astronomy, in this case processing data from the GASKAP-HI pilot surveys. We delineate a four-step process which can be followed by other researchers wishing to port an existing workflow from a public facility to a commercial provider. We used the process to provide reference images for an ongoing upgrade to ASKAPSoft (the ASKAP SDP software), and to provide science images for the GASKAP collaboration, using the joint deconvolution capability of WSClean. We document the approach to optimising the pipeline to minimise cost and elapsed time at the commercial provider, and give a resource estimate for processing future full survey data. Finally we document advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned from the project, which will aid other researchers aiming to use commercial supercomputing for radio astronomy imaging. We found the key advantage to be immediate access and high availability, and the main disadvantage to be the need for improved HPC knowledge to take best advantage of the facility.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information to better characterize the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response. We focus on the GW memory of massive black hole binary mergers and use state-of-the-art population models to assess the likelihood of detecting the GW memory within the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for the global fitting of all resolvable sources, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave signals. However, such analyses usually entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we explore the application of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Specifically, we employ linear interpolation and trig interpolation methods to construct transport paths for training CNFs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within CNFs, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using CNFs. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Beyond Limber Angular power Spectra Toolkit. A fast and efficient algorithm for 3x2 pt analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys is approaching, bringing more data with tighter error bars. As a result, theoretical models will become more complex, incorporating additional parameters, which will increase the dimensionality of the parameter space and make posteriors more challenging to explore. Consequently, the need to improve and speed up our current analysis pipelines will grow. In this work, we focus on the 3x2pt statistics, a summary statistic that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its great constraining power. These statistics involve calculating angular two-point correlation functions for the auto- and cross-correlations between galaxy clustering and weak lensing. The corresponding model is determined by integrating the product of the power spectrum and two highly-oscillating Bessel functions over three dimensions, which makes the evaluation particularly challenging. Typically, this difficulty is circumvented by employing the so-called Limber approximation, which is an important source of error. We present BLAST, an innovative and efficient algorithm for calculating angular power spectra without employing the Limber approximation or assuming a scale-dependent growth rate, based on the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The algorithm is compared with the publicly available beyond-Limber codes, whose performances were recently tested by the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration. At similar accuracy, BLAST is $\approx 10$-$15 \times$ faster than the winning method of the challenge, also showing excellent scaling with respect to various hyper-parameters. BLAST is publicly available on GitHub, and we release a repository where we explain how to use the code.</description>

However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>

Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in Chastain et al. (2023). We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>
