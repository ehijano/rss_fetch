      <title>On Hardy spaces, univalent functions and the second coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider normalized univalent functions with prescribed second Taylor coefficient $a_2$. For convex functions $f$ we study the Hardy spaces to which $f$ and $f'$ belong, refining in particular on a theorem of Eenigenburg and Keogh, and give a sharp asymptotic estimate and an explicit uniform bound for their coefficients. Relating the lower order of a convex function to the angle at infinity of its range we deduce that its range lies always in some sector of aperture $|a_2|\pi$. We give sharp smoothness conditions on the boundary for convex functions with prescribed second coefficient.
  We find the sharp Hardy space estimates for $f$ and $f'$ when $f$ belongs to other geometric subclasses, such as those of starlike, close-to-convex, convex in one direction, convex in the positive direction and typically real funtions. We extend a theorem of Lohwater, Piranian and Rudin, in which a univalent function whose derivative has radial limits almost nowhere is constructed, by showing that this pathological behavior can be obtained for any prescribed value of the second coefficient, in particular, manifesting itself arbitrarily close to the Koebe function.</description>

      <title>The affine geometry of meromorphic connections with irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A meromorphic connection on the tangent bundle of a Riemann surface induces a complex affine structure on the complement of the poles. Local models for Fuchsian singularities are already known. In this paper, we introduce a complete set of local invariants for a meromorphic connection and provide local models for a complex affine structure in a punctured neighborhood of an irregular singularity. Generalizing a construction attributed to Veech, we introduce the Delaunay decomposition of a compact Riemann surface endowed with a meromorphic connection with irregular singularities. In particular, we give upper bounds on the complexity of the decomposition.</description>

      <title>Volume functions and boundary data of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress on two closely related sets of questions concerning convex co-compact hyperbolic manifolds, or convex domains in those manifolds, such as their convex core. The first set of questions is to what extent the hyperbolic metric on such a manifold is uniquely determined by either of two possible geometric data on their boundary. The second aspect is the ``volume'' associated to such a manifold, such as the renormalized volume of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold. The relation between the two is provided by the first variation of the volume functions, which involves the two kinds of boundary data as ``conjugate'' variables.
  While progress has recently been made on some questions, others remain open. New connections have recently emerged, with physics (and in particular the AdS/CFT correspondence) as well as with probability theory (the Loewner energy).</description>

      <title>Distribution of mixed character sums and extremal problems for Littlewood polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove distributional results for mixed character sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{n\le x }\chi(n)e(n\theta), \end{equation*} for fixed $\theta\in [0,1]$ and random character $\chi \pmod q$, as well as for a fixed character $\chi$ and randomly sampled $\theta\in [0,1].$ We present various applications of our results. For example, we construct Littlewood polynomials with large Mahler measure, thus establishing a new record in the Mahler problem (1963). We also show that $L_{2k}$ norms of well-known Turyn polynomials are asymptotically minimized at the shift $\alpha=1/4,$ proving a conjecture of G\"unther and Schmidt. An important ingredient in our work is a general way of dealing with "log-integrability" problems.</description>

      <title>Composition operators between Toeplitz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that the image of a Toeplitz kernel of dimension greater than $1$ under composition by an inner function is nearly $S^*$-invariant if and only if the inner function is an automorphism. Building on this, we determine the minimal Toeplitz kernel containing the image of a Toeplitz kernel under a composition operator with a general inner symbol, and extend this to weighted composition operators. Specifically, the corresponding cases for minimal model spaces are also given, thereby extending known work on the action of composition operators on model spaces. Finally, we use the equivalences between Toeplitz kernels to derive the explicit maximal vectors for several Toeplitz kernels, with symbols expressed in terms of composition operators and inner functions.</description>

      <title>Characteristic function of a power partial isometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model theory says that there is a bijection between the class of purely contractive analytic functions and the class of completely non-unitary (c.n.u.) contractions modulo unitary equivalence. In this paper we provide a complete classification of the purely contractive analytic functions such that the associated contraction is a c.n.u. power partial isometry. As an application of our findings, we determine a class of contractive polynomials such that the associated c.n.u. power partial isometry is of the explicit diagonal form $S \oplus N \oplus C$, where $S$ and $C^*$ are unilateral shifts and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we obtain a characterization of operator-valued symbols for which the corresponding Toeplitz operator on vector-valued Hardy space is a partial isometry.</description>
