      <title>On the characteristic form of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathfrak{g}$-valued zero-curvature representations (ZCRs) for partial differential equations in two independent variables from the perspective of their extension to the entire infinite jet space, focusing on their characteristic elements. Since conservation laws -- more precisely, conserved currents -- and their generating functions for a given equation are precisely the $\mathbb{R}$-valued ZCRs and their characteristic elements, a natural question arises: to what extent can results known for conservation laws be extended to general $\mathfrak{g}$-valued ZCRs.
  For a fixed matrix Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}(n)$, we formulate ZCRs as equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued function pairs on the infinite jet space that satisfy the Maurer--Cartan condition. Our main result establishes that every such ZCR admits a characteristic representative -- i.e., a representative in which the Maurer--Cartan condition takes a characteristic form -- generalizing the characteristic form known for conservation laws. This form is preserved under gauge transformations and can thus be regarded as a kind of normal form for ZCRs. We derive a new necessary condition, independent of the Maurer--Cartan equation, that must be satisfied by any characteristic representative. This condition is trivial in the abelian case but nontrivial whenever $\mathfrak{g}$ is nonabelian. These findings not only confirm structural assumptions used in previous works but also suggest potential applications in the classification and computation of ZCRs.</description>

      <title>A rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermionic quantum field theories. We show convergence of a discrete-time Grassmann Gaussian integral representation in the time-continuum limit under very general hypotheses. We also prove analyticity of the effective action and explicit bounds for the truncated (connected) expectation values of the non-equilibrium system. These bounds imply clustering with a summable decay in the thermodynamic limit, provided these properties hold at time zero, and provided that the determinant bound and decay constant of the fermionic Keldysh covariance are bounded uniformly in the volume. We then give bounds for these constants and show that uniformity in the volume indeed holds for a general class of systems. Finally we show that in the setting of dissipative quantum systems, these bounds are not necessarily restricted to short times.</description>

      <title>Properties of associated Legendre conical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some new properties of associated Legendre conical functions of the first and second kind, $P^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$ and $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$. In particular we show that with the $\tau$-independent $\mathcal{R}^{K}_{n}(\chi)=(2\pi)^{-3/2}\tanh^{-K}\chi\sinh^{-1/2}\chi[\Gamma(1+K)]^{-1}\int_{0}^{2\pi} d\omega \left (1-\cos \omega/\cosh\chi\right)^{K}e^{in\omega}$ for any general $K$, we can set $P^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)=2\sum_{n}\mathcal{R}^{K}_{n}(\chi)\sin[(\tau-in)\chi)]/(\tau-in)$, where $n$ ranges from $-\ell$ to $\ell$ in unit steps when $K$ is a non-negative integer $\ell$, and from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ in unit steps otherwise. Also we can set $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)=-\pi\sum_n\mathcal{R}^K_{n-K}(\chi)e^{-i \chi(\tau-i(n-K))}/(\tau-i(n-K))$, where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $2\ell$ in unit steps when $K$ is a non-negative integer $\ell$, and from $0$ to $\infty$ in unit steps otherwise. With these forms isolating the entire $\tau$ dependence, and especially its associated pole structure, we can use these forms to determine closed form expressions for integrals over $\tau$ of associated Legendre conical functions and their products. The $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$ have an integral representation containing the integral $\int_{\chi}^{\infty}d\omega e^{i\omega\tau}(\cosh\omega-\cosh\chi)^{K}$, an integral that only converges at $\omega=\infty$ if ${\rm Re}[K]&lt;{\rm Im}[\tau]$. We show how to use the divergence of this integral outside of this range in order to characterize the complex $\tau$ plane pole structure of $Q^{-1/2-K}_{-1/2+i \tau}(\chi)$. We present a new treatment of the Borwein integral and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.</description>

      <title>Fractal Dimension in Nonlinear Wave Dynamics Governed by a Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed analytical and geometrical investigation of the (2+1)-dimensional Boiti-Leon-Pempinelli system, a nonlinear dispersive model arising in the context of fluid and plasma dynamics. By employing a projective Riccati-based ansatz, a new class of exact solutions is systematically derived. These solutions, when visualized, exhibit intricate geometrical features that evolve across multiple spatial scales. To quantify this complexity, a voxel-based box-counting dimension analysis is conducted on the corresponding surface profiles. The analysis reveals non-integer fractal dimensions that vary with magnification, confirming the self-affine nature of the patterns and highlighting the multiscale structure inherent in the system. Such fractal character is not only of theoretical interest but also reflects real-world behaviors in turbulent plasma flows and fine-scale fluid instabilities. The study thus bridges exact analytical solutions with computational fractal geometry, providing a deeper understanding of the BLP system and its relevance in describing natural phenomena characterized by spatial complexity and multiscale interactions.</description>

      <title>Flat bands, Dirac cones, and higher-order band crossings in twisted multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <title>A study of path measures based on second-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02469v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic investigation of the mathematical structure of path measures and their profound connections to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) through the framework of second-order Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations. This approach establishes a unified methodology for analyzing large deviation principles (LDPs), entropy minimization, entropy production, and inverse learning problems in stochastic systems. The second-order HJ equations are shown to play a central role in bridging stochastic dynamics and measure theory while forming the foundation of stochastic geometric mechanics and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics.
  The large deviation rate function is rigorously derived from the probabilistic structure of path measures and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Onsager--Machlup functional of stochastic gradient systems coupled with second-order HJ equations. We revisit entropy minimization problems, including finite time horizon problems and Schr\"{o}dinger's problem, demonstrating the connections with stochastic geometric mechanics. In the context of stochastic thermodynamics, we present a novel decomposition of entropy production, revealing that thermodynamic irreversibility can be interpreted as the difference of the corresponding forward and backward second-order HJ equations. Furthermore, we tackle the challenging problem of identifying stochastic gradient systems from observed most probable paths by reformulating the original nonlinear and non-convex problem into a linear and convex framework through a second-order HJ equation. Together, this work establishes a comprehensive mathematical study of the relations between path measures and stochastic dynamical systems, and their diverse applications in stochastic thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>A notion of partial order in the Choose the Leader model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence. Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic) models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.</description>

      <title>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</description>

      <title>Almost Periodic Solutions of The Cubic Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with almost periodic initial data. We prove that for small analytic quasiperiodic initial data satisfying Diophantine frequency conditions, the Cauchy problem admits a solution that is almost periodic in both space and time, and that this solution is unique among solutions locally bounded in a suitable sense. The analysis combines direct and inverse spectral theory.
  In the inverse spectral theory part, we prove existence, almost periodicity, and uniqueness for solutions with initial data whose associated Dirac operator has purely a.c.\ spectrum that is not too thin. This resolves novel challenges presented by the NLS hierarchy, such as an additional degree of freedom and an additional commuting flow.
  In the direct spectral theory part, for Dirac operators with small analytic quasiperiodic potentials with Diophantine frequency conditions, we prove pure a.c.\ spectrum, exponentially decaying spectral gaps, and spectral thickness conditions (homogeneity and Craig-type conditions).</description>

      <title>Dissipation concentration in two-dimensional fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipation measure arising in the inviscid limit of two-dimensional incompressible fluids. For Leray-Hopf solutions it is proved that the dissipation is Lebesgue in time and, for almost every time, it is absolutely continuous with respect to the defect measure of strong compactness of the solutions. When the initial vorticity is a measure, the dissipation is proved to be absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable "quadratic" space-time vorticity measure. This results into the trivial measure if the initial vorticity has singular part of distinguished sign, or a spatially purely atomic measure if wild oscillations in time are ruled out. In fact, the dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale is the only relevant one, in turn offering new criteria for anomalous dissipation. We provide kinematic examples highlighting the strengths and the limitations of our approach. Quantitative rates, dissipation life-span and steady fluids are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Bulk asymptotics of the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble characteristic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble (G$\beta$E) is a fundamental model in random matrix theory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive asymptotic description of the characteristic polynomial of the G$\beta$E anywhere in the bulk of the spectrum that simultaneously captures both local-scale fluctuations (governed by the Sine-$\beta$ point process) and global/mesoscopic log-correlated Gaussian structure, which is accurate down to vanishing errors as $N\to\infty$.
  As immediate corollaries, we obtain several important results: (1) convergence of characteristic polynomial ratios to the stochastic zeta function, extending known results from Valko and Virag to the G$\beta$E; (2) a martingale approximation of the log-characteristic polynomial which immediately recovers the central limit theorem from Bourgade, Mody and Pain; (3) a description of the order one correction to the martingale in terms of the stochastic Airy function.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Clifford to qubit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebras with given (anti-)commutativity structure are widespread in quantum mechanics. This structure is captured by quasi-Clifford algebras (QCA): a QCA generated by $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is is given by the relations $\alpha_i^2 = k_i$ and $\alpha_j \alpha_i = (-1)^{\chi_{ij}} \alpha_i \alpha_j$, where $k_i \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\chi_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$. We present a mapping from QCA to Pauli algebras and discuss its use in quantum information and computation. The mapping also provides a Wedderburn decomposition of matrix groups with quasi-Clifford structure. This provides a block-diagonalization for e.g. Pauli groups, while for Majorana operators the Jordan-Wigner transform is recovered. Applications to the symmetry reduction of semidefinite programs and for constructing maximal anti-commuting subsets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ladder Operators for Laguerre-type and Jacobi-type Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature concerning the Laguerre-type weight function $x^\lambda w_0(x), x\in[0,+\infty)$, the Jacobi-type weight function $(1-x)^{\alpha}(1+x)^{\beta}w_0(x),x\in[-1,1]$, and the shifted Jacobi-type weight function $x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta}w_0(x), x\in[0,1]$, with $w_0(x)$ continuously differentiable, the parameters $\lambda,\alpha,\beta$ are usually constrained to be strictly positive to ensure the validity of the results. Recently, in [C. Min and P. Fang, Physica D 473 (2025), 134560 (9pp)], the ladder operators for the monic Laguerre-type orthogonal polynomials with $\lambda&gt;-1$ were derived by exploiting the orthogonality properties. The quantities $A_n$ and $B_n$, which appear as coefficients in the ladder operators, exhibit different expressions compared with the previous ones for $\lambda&gt;0$. In this paper, we construct an alternative deduction by making use of the Riemann-Hilbert problem satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, we employ both derivation strategies mentioned above to produce the ladder operators for the monic standard and shifted Jacobi-type orthogonal polynomials with $\alpha,\beta&gt;-1$. When $\lambda,\alpha,\beta$ are restricted to positive values, our expressions of $A_n$ and $B_n$ are consistent with those in prior work. We present examples to validate our findings and generalize the existing conclusions, established by using the three compatibility conditions of the ladder operators and differentiating the orthogonality relations for the monic orthogonal polynomials, from $\lambda,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$ to $\lambda,\alpha,\beta&gt;-1$.</description>

      <title>Partial regularity of optimal transport with Coulomb cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for two-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost, the optimal map is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ diffeomorphism outside a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero provided the marginals are $\alpha$-H\"older continuous and bounded away from zero and infinity. Excluding a set of measure zero is necessary as optimal maps for the Coulomb cost have long been known to exhibit jump singularities across codimension $1$ surfaces (even for smooth marginals on convex domains).</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates of Landau-de Gennes minimizers in the vanishing elasticity limit with line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the Landau-de Gennes functional modeling nematic liquid crystals in dimension three, we prove that, if the energy is bounded by $C(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+1)$, then the sequence of minimizers $\{\mathbf{Q}_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon\in (0,1)}$ is relatively compact in $W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$ for every $1&lt;p&lt;2$. This extends the classical compactness theorem of Bourgain-Br\'{e}zis-Mironescu [Publ. Math., IH\'{E}S, 99:1-115, 2004] for complex Ginzburg-Landau minimizers to the $\mathbb R\mathbf P^2$-valued Landau-de Gennes setting. Moreover, We obtain local bounds on the integral of the bulk energy potential that are uniform in $ \varepsilon $, improving the estimate that follows directly from the assumption.</description>

      <title>Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01876v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.</description>

      <title>Cartier integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings via 2-holonomy of the CMKZ 2-connection, I: Hexagonators and the Breen polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from "Syllepses from 3-shifted Poisson structures and second-order integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings". Given a symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding on a symmetric strict monoidal cochain 2-category, we construct a candidate hexagonator series as a 2-holonomy with respect to the Cirio-Martins-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (CMKZ) fake flat 2-connection over the configuration space of 3 distinguishable particles on the complex line, $Y_3$. The second-order term of the hexagonator series is computed and found to agree with the "infinitesimal hexagonator" from the aforementioned work. Finally, we assume a coherent totally symmetric strict infinitesimal 2-braiding and prove that the Breen polytope axiom is satisfied by translating it into a 2-loop in $Y_3$.</description>

      <title>On the cardinalities of quantum Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $v$, QLS($v$), is a $v\times v$ array in which each of entries is a unit column vector from the Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{v}$, such that every row and column forms an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{C}^{v}$. The cardinality of a QLS($v$) is the number of its vectors distinct up to a global phase, which is the crucial indicator for distinguishing between classical QLSs and non-classical QLSs. In this paper, we investigate the possible cardinalities of a QLS($v$). As a result, we completely resolve the existence of a QLS($v$) with maximal cardinality for any $v\geq 4$. Moreover, based on Wilson's construction and Direct Product construction, we establish some possible cardinality range of a QLS($v$) for any $v\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras associated with Hopf algebroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the operadic modeling of brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras, as developed by Gerstenhaber and Voronov, to the context of Hopf algebroids in the sense of Xu. Specifically, we construct a strict $B_{\infty}$ isomorphism between the type I and type II twisted brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras arising from any twistor of a Hopf algebroid. As an application of this framework, we examine two specific brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras derived from Lie algebra pairs, and reveal previously obscured relationships between them. One of these is the dg Lie algebra governing deformations of algebraic dynamical twists, while the other arises from the quantum groupoid comprised of particular invariant differential operators.</description>

      <title>Sparse Gabor representations of metaplectic operators: controlled exponential decay and Schr\"odinger confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the phase space analysis of Schr\"odinger evolution operators, in this paper we investigate how metaplectic operators are approximately diagonalized along the corresponding symplectic flows by exponentially localized Gabor wave packets. Quantitative bounds for the matrix coefficients arising in the Gabor wave packet decomposition of such operators are established, revealing precise exponential decay rates together with subtler dispersive and spreading phenomena. To this aim, we present several novel results concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled Gelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct, we generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general exponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\"odinger propagators. In particular, we extensively discuss some prominent models such as the harmonic oscillator, the free particle in a constant magnetic field and fractional Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Exact CHY Integrand Construction Using Combinatorial Neural Networks and Discrete Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the inverse CHY problem-constructing integrands from desired pole structures-by establishing a correspondence between CHY combinatorics and Combinatorial Neural Networks (CNNs). Our key innovation is the generalized pole degree $K(s_A)$, which is additive under integrand multiplication and satisfies hierarchical recursion relations. These recursions naturally map to CNN message-passing architectures, enabling discrete automatic differentiation that preserves exact integer constraints throughout the computation. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that yield numerical approximations, our method leverages the intrinsic combinatorial structure of the CHY formalism to guarantee exact algebraic solutions. This work demonstrates how specialized neural architectures can solve fundamental physics problems requiring strict mathematical constraints, providing a modest step toward bridging combinatorics, machine learning, and scattering amplitude theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures of Vassiliev invariants for knot families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants expressed through correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form an infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. It turns out that such a 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, the number of generators can be infinite. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for a $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is an open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $\leq k$ Vassiliev invariants. Again, we have only examples of a set of $k$ Vassiliev invariants being a complete invariant of a $k$-parametric knot family. Currently, it is unknown whether a set of a fewer number of Vassiliev invariants cannot be a complete knot family invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and a Commuting Local Frame of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes the relationship between the Koopman eigenfunctions of a first-order nonlinear ODE system and its symmetries. Specifically, a bijective mapping is obtained between i) a commuting local frame of symmetry generators, and ii) a set of Koopman eigenfunctions whose gradients form a local frame. This equivalence is used to convert the problem of finding Koopman eigenfunctions into the equivalent problem of finding commuting vector fields, which are readily given by the flow map of the system. The implication for stability is also studied in terms of a contraction metric that is associated with the commuting local frame of symmetries. The theoretical result is verified with the van der Pol oscillator whose eigenfunctions are computed to the precision of finite numerical integration.</description>

      <title>Summing over homology groups of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory approach to describe ice crystals habit evolution in ice clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice clouds, particularly cirrus clouds, significantly influence Earth's radiative balance but remain poorly characterized in current climate models. A major uncertainty arises from the variability of their microphysical properties, especially the evolution of ice crystal habits under depositional growth. We propose a heuristic method to describe habit evolution based on four fundamental shapes identified in the literature and from in situ observations: droxtals, plates, columns, and rosettes. These represent the primary forms that are relevant under depositional growth, excluding aggregation. In this study, we employ a non-Abelian gauge theory within a field-theoretical framework, imposing an SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) symmetry on the fields associated with each habit probability growth. This symmetry enables the derivation of a modified system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, capturing the stochastic growth dynamics of ice crystals while incorporating phenomenological mutual influences among habits. This framework outlines a novel theoretical direction for integrating symmetry principles and field-theoretical tools into the modelling of habit dynamics in ice clouds.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles. The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions. Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA), computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation. This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators, this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both alternatives.</description>

      <title>Extended State Space for describing renormalized Fock spaces in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.12608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the non-perturbative renormalization of a class of simple polaron models with resting fermions. The considered dispersion relations and form factors are allowed to be highly singular, such that infinite self-energies and wave function renormalizations may occur and the diagonalizing dressing transformations might not be implementable on Fock space. Instead of taking cutoffs, we rigorously interpret the self-energies and wave function renormalizations as elements of suitable vector spaces, as well as a field extension of the complex numbers. Moreover, we define two extended state vector spaces (ESSs) over this field extension, which contain a dense subspace of Fock space, but also incorporate non-square-integrable wave functions. Elements of these ESSs can be seen as states of virtual particles, described in a mathematically rigorous way. The Hamiltonian without cutoffs, formally infinite counterterms, and the dressing transformation can then be defined as linear operators between certain subspaces of the two Fock space extensions. This way, we obtain a renormalized Hamiltonian which can be realized as a densely defined self-adjoint operator on Fock space.</description>

      <title>Implementing Bogoliubov Transformations Beyond the Shale-Stinespring Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide two extensions of a dense subspace of Fock space, such that Bogoliubov transformations become implementable on them, even though they violate the Shale-Stinespring condition, so they are not implementable on Fock space. Both the bosonic and fermionic case are covered. Conditions for implementability in the extended sense are stated and proved. From these, we derive conditions for a quadratic Hamiltonian to be diagonalizable by a Bogoliubov transformation that is implementable in the extended sense. Three examples illustrate situations, in which an implementation in the extended sense is possible although the Shale-Stinespring condition fails to hold.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.</description>

      <title>Entropic Fluctuations in Statistical Mechanics II. Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Evans-Searles, respectively Gallavotti-Cohen, fluctuation theorem concerns certain universal statistical features of the entropy production rate of a classical system in a transient, respectively steady, state. In this paper, we consider and compare several possible extensions of these fluctuation theorems to quantum systems. In addition to the direct two-time measurement approach whose discussion is based on (LMP 114:32 (2024)), we discuss a variant where measurements are performed indirectly on an auxiliary system called ancilla, and which allows to retrieve non-trivial statistical information using ancilla state tomography. We also show that modular theory provides a way to extend the classical notion of phase space contraction rate to the quantum domain, which leads to a third extension of the fluctuation theorems. We further discuss the quantum version of the principle of regular entropic fluctuations, introduced in the classical context in (Nonlinearity 24, 699 (2011)). Finally, we relate the statistical properties of these various notions of entropy production to spectral resonances of quantum transfer operators. The obtained results shed a new light on the nature of entropic fluctuations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler problem concerns a point particle in an attractive inverse square force. After a brief review of the classical and quantum versions of this problem, focused on their hidden $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$ symmetry, we discuss the quantum Kepler problem for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We show that the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of bound states for this problem is unitarily equivalent, as a representation of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$, to the Hilbert space of solutions of the Weyl equation on the spacetime $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. This equation describes a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We then form the fermionic Fock space on $\mathcal{H}$ and show this is unitarily equivalent to the Hilbert space of a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ free quantum field on $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$, again as representations of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$. By modifying the Hamiltonian of this free field theory, we obtain the well-known "Madelung rules". These give a reasonable approximation to the observed filling of subshells as we consider elements with more and more electrons, and match the rough overall structure of the periodic table.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this article, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</description>

Abstract: We explore the connection between tasep-like interacting particle systems and last passage percolation type polymer models, focusing on three models: Geometric, Exponential and Brownian last passage percolation and their associated tasep particle systems. We explain how formulas for certain natural observables in last passage percolation translate to formulas for tasep, by going through a notion of "duality". In turn, we obtain determinantal formulas for last passage percolation with a deterministic boundary and for tasep with a deterministic first particle trajectory.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.</description>

Abstract: We prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem for bistochastic completely positive (bcp) linear cocycles acting on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, giving an invariant splitting described explicitly in terms of the multiplicative domains of the underlying bcp maps. As an application of our theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking. We conclude by demonstrating a certain class of bcp linear cocycles are almost surely entanglement breaking in finite time.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

Abstract: We consider an equidistant array of disjoint potential wells in $\mathbb{R}^\nu,\: \nu\ge 2$, built over a straight line, and show that, under a restriction on the potential support aspect ratio, a perturbation consisting of longitudinal shifts of a finite number of them preserving the disjointness gives rise to a nonempty discrete spectrum below the threshold of the lowest spectral band.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distributions in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Operational Protocols to Quantum Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Commutator calculus and symbolic differentiation of matrix functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators act on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Daleckii--Krein formula. In this sense, the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix-valued functions that are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (Hencky logarithmic strain, objective rates, spin tensors, viscoelastic fluids) and in the theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of matrix models such that their partition functions are tau functions of the universal character (UC) hierarchy. This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: A system of equations for Multiscale Geodesic Flow (MGF) is introduced whose solutions illustrate the paradigm of whorls within whorls within whorls, introduced by L. F. Richardson in 1922 to describe the cascade of energy in fluid turbulence. Numerical simulations are given for MGF on $S^1$, where the MGF equation comprises a multiscale generalisation of the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation whose emergent singular solutions generalise the peakon solutions of the CH.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$, namely (functional) proportionality between the Cotton-York tensor field and the holographic stress tensor field at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars. The results are compatible with any matter content of the physical spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vanishing elasticity limit for minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes model with finite energy. By adopting a refined blow-up and covering analysis, we establish the optimal $ L^p $ ($ 1&lt;p&lt;+\infty $) convergence of minimizers and achieve the sharp $ L^1 $ convergence rate of the bulk energy term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an integrable hierarchy of the Boussinesq equation using the Lie-algebraic approach of Holod-Flashka-Newell-Ratiu. We show that finite-gap hamiltonian systems of the hierarchy arise on coadjoint orbits in the loop algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$, and possess spectral curves from the family of $(3,3N\,{+}\,1)$-curves, $N\,{\in}\, \Natural$. Separation of variables leads to the Jacobi inversion problem on the mentioned curves, which is solved in terms of the corresponding multiply periodic functions. An exact finite-gap solution of the Boussinesq equation is obtained explicitly, and a conjecture on the reality conditions is made. The obtained solutions are computed for several spectral curves, and illustrated graphically.</description>

      <title>Smallest gaps of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with a general potential at the determinantal temperature, or equivalently, the eigenvalues of random normal matrices. We prove that the smallest gaps between particles are typically of order $n^{-3/4}$, and that the associated joint point process of gap locations and gap sizes, after rescaling the gaps by $n^{3/4}$, converges to a Poisson point process. As a consequence, we show that the $k$-th smallest rescaled gap has a limiting density proportional to $x^{4k-1}e^{-\frac{\mathcal{J}}{4}x^{4}}$, where $\mathcal{J}=\pi^{2}\int \rho(z)^{3}d^{2}z$ and $\rho$ is the density of the equilibrium measure. This generalizes a result of Shi and Jiang beyond the quadratic potential.</description>
