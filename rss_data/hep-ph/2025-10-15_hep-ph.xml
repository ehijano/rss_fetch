      <title>More Effective RS Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive the effective theory for a stabilized five-dimensional warped geometry, addressing several outstanding issues in this derivation. These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violation and Local Lepton Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the predictions for lepton number violating processes within the minimal theory of neutrino masses based on the spontaneous breaking of local lepton number. In this framework, the symmetry is broken at the low scale, leading to the existence of a viable dark matter candidate. The new fermions required for anomaly cancellation mediate lepton number violating processes at the one-loop level. We present a detailed calculation of the most relevant processes, including $\mu \to e \gamma$, $\mu \to 3 e$, and $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei. The regions of parameter space excluded by current experimental bounds are identified, and we emphasize the interplay between collider observables and charged lepton flavor violating signatures as a key test of this minimal theory of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>BBN Constraints on the Hadronic Annihilation of sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of residual annihilation from sub-GeV mass thermal relic dark matter candidates during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Focusing on candidates with $p$-wave annihilation channels, we show that the hadronic injection of pions and kaons beyond freeze-out, and their subsequent interaction with protons and neutrons prior to the deuterium bottleneck, provides a sensitivity to annihilation that surpasses that of the CMB and indirect detection in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the Speed-up of Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Entangled Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit-based sensing platforms offer promising new directions for wave-like dark matter searches. Recent proposals demonstrate that entangled qubits can achieve quadratic scaling of the signal in the number of qubits. In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\gtrsim 30{-}40~\mu{\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved. The advantage increases at higher masses where cavity volume scaling becomes less favorable.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated tilt of isocurvature fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''&lt;3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modeling the TMD shape function in $J/\psi$ electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-to-leading order hard function for quarkonium electroproduction is calculated within the framework of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization in the low-transverse-momentum regime. The structure of the TMD shape function in quarkonium leptoproduction is analyzed through its operator-level definition. Particular attention is given to the convolution of the unpolarized TMD gluon distribution with the TMD shape function, thereby illustrating the latter's phenomenological role. Building on this framework, we provide predictions for the unpolarized differential cross-section of $J/\psi$ electroproduction at the future Electron-Ion Collider in the region of small transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>A SHIFT of Perspective: Observing Neutrinos at CMS and ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physics potential of SHIFT@LHC, a proposed gaseous fixed target installed in the LHC tunnel, as a novel source of detectable neutrinos. Using simulations of proton-gas collisions, hadron propagation, and neutrino interactions, we estimate that $O(10^4)$ muon-neutrino and $O(10^3)$ electron-neutrino interactions, spanning energies from 20 GeV to 1 TeV, would occur in the CMS and ATLAS detectors with 1% of the LHC Run-4 integrated luminosity. This unique configuration provides access to hadron production in the pseudorapidity range 5&lt;$\eta$&lt;8, complementary to existing LHC detectors. If realized, this would mark the first detection of neutrinos in a general-purpose LHC detector, opening a new avenue to study neutrino production and interactions in a regime directly relevant to atmospheric neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of charmonium-like mesons, heavy-light mesons with charm, AdS/QCD, and configurational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-light-flavor meson resonances with charm, in the $D^0$ and $D^*$ families, and charmonium-like states, in the $\eta_c$ and $\chi_{c1}$ families, are explored and discussed in the AdS/QCD model with four quark flavors. The differential configurational entropy is computed and analyzed for these four charmed meson families, also combining 4-flavor AdS/QCD to experimental data for the $D^0$, $D^*$, $\eta_c$, and $\chi_{c1}$ meson families. It makes it possible to predict the mass spectrum of unexplored heavier charmed meson resonances and to identify further charmed meson states reported in PDG.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed.</description>

      <title>Jet quenching without energy loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of jet quenching, i.e. the suppression of high transverse momentum particles and jets, is an important question in the context of understanding the onset of collective behaviour and small collision systems. We investigate a minimal scenario where a hard parton experiences a single soft re-scattering that leaves the kinematics unmodified, but the colour exchange leads to a loss of colour coherence that is observable in the final distribution of fragments. In particular, the formation time of the first splitting as reconstructed at hadron level from jets using the formation time clustering algorithm is sensitive the loss of colour coherence. Moreover, it can distinguish the coherence loss scenario from a corresponding energy loss scenario, since small energy loss effects leave the formation time distribution unchanged.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous global QCD analysis of kaon and pion parton distributions with lattice QCD constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of pion and kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), constrained by pion- and kaon-induced Drell-Yan (DY) and leading neutron electroproduction data, together with lattice QCD data on pion and kaon PDF moments. The analysis indicates a softer valence $\bar u$ distribution in the $K^-$ than in the $\pi^-$, and a significantly more peaked valence $s$-quark density in $K^-$ compared with the $\bar u$. The effective exponent governing the high-$x$ behavior of the PDF is found to be larger for $\bar u$ in the kaon, $\beta_{\bar u}^{K^-}\!= 1.6(2)$, than in the pion, $\beta_{\bar u}^{\pi^-}\!= 1.16(4)$, in the range $0.7 \leq x \leq 0.95$. From the gluon momentum fractions we find the pion's gluon content accounts for $\approx 1/3$ of the mass budget of the pion at $\mu=2~{\rm GeV}$, but only $\approx 1/4$ for the kaon.</description>

      <title>A Solution to the Hierarchy Problem with Non-Linear Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the hierarchy problem of the standard model of particle physics can be solved by adding a state-dependent term to the Higgs sector. We present an example of a scalar field with a Higgs-like potential with an additional term proportional to the expectation value of the squared Higgs field operator. We show that the mass can be parametrically lighter than the theory's energy-momentum cutoff without fine tuning. We find the Higgs mass can be technically natural, even with a Planck-scale cutoff. The simplest version of the theory may not be distinguishable from the standard model at colliders, but other versions might. In addition, some aspects of cosmological evolution can be different in this model, in some cases radically.</description>

      <title>Gradient-flowed operator product expansion without IR renormalons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing problem concerns the question how to consistently combine perturbative expansions in QCD with power corrections in the context of the operator product expansion (OPE), since the former exhibit ambiguities due to infrared renormalons, which are of the same order as the power corrections. We propose to use the gradient flow time $1/\sqrt{t}$ as a factorization scale and to express the OPE in terms of IR renormalon-free subtracted perturbative expansions and unambiguous matrix elements of gradient-flow regularized local operators. We show on the example of the Adler function and its leading power correction from the gluon condensate that this method dramatically improves the convergence of the perturbative expansion. We employ lattice data on the action density to estimate the gradient-flowed gluon condensate, and obtain the Adler function with non-perturbative accuracy and significantly reduced theoretical uncertainty, enlarging the predictivity at low $Q^2$. When applied to the hadronic decay width of the tau lepton, the method resolves the long-standing discrepancy between the fixed-order and contour-improved approach in favour of the fixed-order treatment.</description>

      <title>An improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ ($L$ denotes the light ground state pseudoscalar, vector mesons and the corresponding $p$-wave scalar, axial-vector, and tensor ones) and predict their branching ratios (BRs) associated with relative ratios at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. Our results ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+) =(2.03^{+0.53}_{-0.41}) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 1.74^{+0.66}_{-0.50}$ are consistent with several available predictions in different approaches within uncertainties. Inputting the measured $\eta_c \to p\bar p$ and $\eta_c \to \pi^+\pi^- (\pi^+\pi^-, K^+ K^-, p\bar p)$ BRs with $p$ here being a proton, we derive the multibody $B_c^+ \to \eta_c (\pi, \rho)^+$ BRs through secondary decay chains via resonance $\eta_c$ under the narrow-width approximation, which might facilitate the (near) future tests of $B_c \to \eta_c$ decays. Under the $q\bar q$ assignment of light scalars, different to $B_c$ decaying into $J/\psi$ plus a scalar meson and other $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ modes, surprisingly small BRs around ${\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-9})$ of $\Delta S =0$ modes and highly large ratios near ${\cal O}(10^{2})$ between the BRs of $\Delta S=1$ and $\Delta S=0$ modes are found in the $B_c$ decays to $\eta_c$ plus light scalars. Many large BRs and interesting ratios presented in this work could be tested at the LHC experiments, which would help us to examine the reliability of this improved perturbative QCD formalism for $B_c$-meson decays and further understand the QCD dynamics in the considered decay modes, as well as in the related hadrons.</description>

      <title>Constraining Heavy Neutral Leptons Coupled to the Tau-Neutrino Flavor at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displaced vertex (DV) signatures at colliders offer a powerful probe of new long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model. Among the best-motivated candidates are heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) - heavier counterparts of Standard Model neutrinos - which can account for the origin of neutrino masses and potentially produce di-leptonic DV signatures.
  In this study, we demonstrate how existing DV searches at the LHC can be extended to probe HNLs that couple predominantly to the tau-neutrino flavor. While current search strategies rely on identifying a prompt lepton alongside a displaced vertex, we show that analyzing events without a prompt lepton enables sensitivity to the process $pp \to W \to \tau N$, where the tau decays hadronically and the HNL subsequently decays to a lepton pair and a neutrino.
  We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of this process with HNLs decaying to $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$ final states, apply ATLAS-inspired selection criteria, and optimize signal sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate cuts in the plane of di-lepton invariant mass and DV radial position significantly enhance signal visibility. We propose several such optimized strategies and show that even with Run 2 data $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ , existing bounds can be improved by more than an order of magnitude. Future high-luminosity runs may strengthen sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to current limits.</description>

      <title>Search for the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ Molecular State $X_{2}(4013)$ in $K^{-}p$ and $pp$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12292v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the interpretation of $X(3872)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, heavy-quark spin symmetry predicts a spin-2 partner, $X_{2}(4013)$, which can be regarded as a $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ molecule with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. Its experimental confirmation, however, remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the production mechanisms of $X_{2}(4013)$ in the reactions $K^{-}p \to \Lambda_{c}^{+} D_{s}^{-} X_{2}(4013)$ and $pp \to \Lambda_{c}^{+}\Lambda_{c}^{+} X_{2}(4013)$ within an effective Lagrangian framework. The production processes are modeled via $t$-channel $D/\bar{D}^{*}$ meson exchanges, while initial-state interactions (ISI) mediated by Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are also taken into account. Our calculations indicate that the total cross sections can reach the pb level, suggesting that $X_{2}(4013)$ may be accessible at current and future experiments such as AMBER@CERN and LHCb. Inclusion of ISI enhances the cross sections by nearly one order of magnitude. The differential distributions show distinct angular behaviors for the two reactions: the $K^{-}p$ reaction exhibits a forward-peaked distribution, whereas the $pp$ reaction shows a dip near central angles. This study provides a quantitative theoretical benchmark for future experimental searches of $X_2(4013)$ and highlights the importance of initial-state interactions (ISI) in high-energy particle investigations.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino electromagnetic properties with recent low-energy electron recoil data at dark matter direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos that are elastically scattered off atomic electrons provide a unique opportunity to investigate the Standard Model (SM) and beyond SM physics. In this work, we explore the new physics effects of neutrino electromagnetic properties through elastic neutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments. The properties of interest include the neutrino magnetic moment, millicharge, and charge radius, all of which are natural consequences of non-zero neutrino masses. We investigate their effects by incorporating each property into the Standard Model (SM) framework, given the measured the solar neutrino flux. By analyzing the latest Run 0 and Run 1 datasets from the PandaX-4T experiment, together with recent results from XENONnT, we derive new constraints on each electromagnetic property of neutrino. We present both flavor-independent results, obtained using a common parameter for all three neutrino flavors, and flavor-dependent results, derived by marginalizing over the three neutrino flavor components. Bounds we obtained are comparable or improved compared to those reported in the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Initial-state geometry and multiplicity distributions in pPb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the possibility of accessing the initial geometric shape of the proton in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC, in particular the configuration in which the proton is made of three quarks linked by a Y-shape gluon string, called baryon junction. This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/\psi$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included.</description>

      <title>Complementarity of gravitational wave analyses and di-Higgs production in the exploration of the Electroweak Phase Transition dynamics in the RxSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM), RxSM, is one of the simplest Beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) theories that can accommodate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT). We survey the possible thermal histories of the early Universe in the RxSM, and find that a SFOEWPT can occur in this model as single- or two-step phase transitions. We investigate complementary approaches to probe such scenarios experimentally: either via searches for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs) or via searches for di-Higgs production processes at future collider experiments: the HL-LHC, or a possible high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. For these analyses we consistently include one-loop corrections to the trilinear Higgs couplings. We find that entirely different phenomenological signals are possible, depending on how the SFOEWPT occurs. In scenarios where such a transition is driven by the Higgs doublet direction in field space, BSM deviations in properties of the detected Higgs boson, particularly in the trilinear scalar coupling, typically lead to observable signals at colliders, while the regions of parameter space with detectable GW signals are very narrow. On the other hand, if the SFOEWPT is triggered by the singlet field direction, the detected Higgs boson is very SM-like and no signs of BSM physics would appear in di-Higgs production processes. However, strong GW signals could be produced for significant parts of the RxSM parameter space with singlet-driven SFOEWPT. This work highlights the crucial importance of exploiting complementary experimental directions to determine the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition and access the shape of the Higgs potential realised in Nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cannon-Ball model of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their afterglows--described in the text and in innumerable previous occasions--is extremely successful and predictive. In a few intrinsically bright GRBs, gamma-rays with energies in the TeV range have been observed. The CB model, I argue, has no difficulty in describing the origin and approximate properties of these high-energy gamma rays and the extreme difficulty of observing their accompanying neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic dark matter (IDM) models feature an energy threshold for scattering with Standard Model particles, which enables their consistency with the increasingly stringent limits placed by direct detection experiments. In a typical construction, elastic scattering is absent at tree level, and a lighter dark matter state must first upscatter into a heavier state in order to interact with the nuclei in the detector. We model the excitation of IDM in the Earth followed by its downscattering inside a detector, and we show that considering this process markedly enhances the sensitivity of existing detectors. In particular, current limits based on XENON100 and XENON1T data can be extended to significantly larger mass splittings.</description>

      <title>The Effective Radius of an Electric Point Charge in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the century-old problem of modeling the electron as a pointlike particle with finite self energy, we develop a new class of nonlinear perturbations of Maxwell's electrodynamics inspired by, but distinct from, the Born--Infeld theory. A hallmark of our construction is that the effective radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reflection is a fascinating signature of the quantum vacuum that emerges from inhomogeneities in the electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of the prospective real-world implementation of quantum reflection in the back-reflection channel, we provide the first numerical estimates for the light-by-light scattering with dipole pulses, which are known to provide the tightest focusing of light possible. For an all-optical setup with a dipole pump and Gaussian probe of the same frequency, we find that the dominant signal signature is related mainly to the back-reflection channel from 4-wave mixing. Focusing on this, we study the particular case of a multiple focusing pulses configuration (belt configuration) as an approximation to the idealized dipole pulse. Using Bayesian optimization methods, we determine optimal parameters that maximize the detectability of a discernible back-reflection signal. Our study indicates that the optimization favors a three-beam collision setup, which we further investigate both numerically and analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields --such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom-- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the na{\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.</description>

      <title>Universality of the chiral soliton lattice in the low energy limit of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories with pseudoscalars that couple through anomalies (such as axion models) are of particular phenomenological interest. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of all bounds obtainable from bootstrapping the amplitudes when a pseudoscalar couples to photons and gravitons. This allows us to find new cutoff scales of theories with anomalies that are more restrictive than those obtained from naive perturbative analysis. Our results are especially relevant for holographic models, as the bounds determine the allowed region of the five-dimensional EFTs, for example, by imposing strong bounds on Chern-Simons terms. We also consider modifications of General Relativity in photon--graviton couplings and show that current experiments are sensitive to these effects only if new physics appears at $\sim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of stochastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study heat conduction and momentum transport in the context of stochastic fluid dynamics. We consider a fluid described by model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. We study both non-critical and critical fluids, and we investigate transport properties in two as well as three dimensions. Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>GEFF: The Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - A tool for inflationary gauge-field production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.</description>

      <title>Impact of CP violation searches at MOMENT experiment with sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the scope of the MOMENT experiment in the context of CP violation searches with the presence of extra eV scale sterile neutrino. MOMENT is a proposed medium baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using muon beams for neutrinos production, making it advantageous over $\pi_0$ background and other technical difficulties. We work over the first oscillation maxima which matches the peak value of flux with a run time of 5 years for both neutrino and anti-neutrino modes. We perform the bi-probability studies for both 3 and 3+1 flavor mixing schemes. The CP violation sensitivities arising from the fundamental CP phase $\delta_{13}$ and unknown CP phase $\delta_{14}$ are explored at the firm footing. Slight deteriorations are observed in CP violations induced by $\delta_{13}$ as the presence of sterile neutrino is considered. We also look at the reconstruction of CP violations phases $\delta_{13}$ and $\delta_{14}$ and the MOMENT experiment shows significant capabilities in the precise measurement of $\delta_{13}$ phase.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, non-thermal productions via the freeze-in and SuperWIMP mechanism are also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristics for Feynman Integral Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new methods for optimizing the integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals, an important computational bottleneck in modern perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Using the simple example of one-loop massive bubble integrals, we pose the problem of minimizing the number of arithmetic operations in reducing a target integral to master integrals via the Laporta algorithm. This is a nontrivial combinatorial optimization problem over the ordering of IBP equation generation (from pairs of seed integrals and IBP operators) and the ordering of integral elimination. Our first proposed method is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an environment in a step-by-step manner and learning the best actions to take given an observation of the environment (in this case, the current state of the IBP reduction process). The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g. simulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function of numerical priority values that control the orderings. For large-scale problems, the number of free parameters can be compressed by using a small neural network to assign priority values. Remarkably, with almost no human guidance, both methods lead to IBP reduction schemes that are competitive with the most efficient human-designed algorithms. We also found interpretable features in the AI results that may be applicable to more complicated problems.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions at Neutrino Experiments and Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of new physics on the interactions of neutrinos with other particles can be parametrized by a set of effective four-fermion operators called non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs). This NSI framework is useful for studying the complementarity between different types of neutrino experiments. In this work, we further compare the reach of neutrino experiments with high-energy collider experiments. Since high-energy colliders often probe the mass scale associated with the four-fermion operators, the effective field theory approach becomes invalid and explicit models must be utilized. We study a variety of representative simplified models including new U(1) gauge bosons, scalar leptoquarks, and heavy neutral leptons. For each of these, we examine the model parameter space constrained by NSI bounds from current and future neutrino experiments, and by data from the Large Hadron Collider and planned electron-positron and muon colliders. We find that in the models we study, with the possible exceptions of muon-philic leptoquarks and heavy neutral leptons mixing with electron or muon neutrinos, collider searches are more constraining than neutrino measurements. Additionally, we briefly comment on other model building possibilities for obtaining models where neutrino experiments are most constraining.</description>

      <title>Constraining anomalous $W tb$ and related SMEFT couplings using low-energy and electroweak precision observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on couplings of Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) operators contributing to $Wtb$ effective vertex at tree level. We study the one-loop level impact of these couplings on the low-energy flavour changing charged and neutral current processes and on the electroweak precision observables. We use the available data on these relevant processes to constrain the associated SMEFT/$Wtb$ couplings. Solving the renormalisation group equations, we connect the SMEFT couplings at different scales and use the bounds at low energy to obtain the relevant bounds at the large scale $\Lambda$. Our findings indicate significantly improved constraints on the couplings compared to existing constraints on $Wtb$ couplings by ATLAS and CMS. Additionally, we predict branching ratios for various top-FCNC processes, which exceed SM expectations by several orders of magnitude but remain within the reach of future colliders. These SMEFT couplings, or anomalous couplings of the effective $Wtb$ vertex, can further constrain different UV-complete and simplified models that generate such interactions at the tree or loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</description>

      <title>RG evolution and effect of intermediate new physics on $\Delta B=2$ six-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent identification of possible 11 neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\bar{n}$) oscillation candidate events at Super-Kamiokande has renewed the interest in $\Delta B = 2$ transitions. In this work, we analyze the Renormalization Group (RG) running of mass dimension-9 six-quark operators, in $\bar{MS}$ scheme, that generate processes like $nn\to \pi^0\pi^0$, deuteron decay, $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillations etc, evolving them from the electroweak scale to baryon number violating scale ($\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$). Our goal is to systematically account for the influence of potential new physics at intermediate energies ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10~ \text{TeV})$), especially given the fact that {\it Large Hadron Collider} has not ruled out new physics beyond $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$. To comprehensively investigate their influence, we consider two scenarios: (i) a minimal setup with only Standard Model degrees of freedom up to the high scale at $\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$, and (ii) an extended framework involving scalar and vector bosons above $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$ up till BNV scale. To facilitate further studies, we also provide a Python script that performs RG evolution of the BNV Wilson coefficients in the presence of generic bosonic new physics at any intermediate energy scale. It can be modified easily to meet the needs of the user to investigate the running of the BNV Wilson coefficients. We then compare the result with the experimental bound from the neutron-antineutron oscillation process and constrain the scale of baryon number violating new physics.</description>

Abstract: In the phenomenology study of dark photon, its mass origin is usually not under concern. However, in theory construction its mass is often generated via a dark Higgs mechanism, which leads to the presence of a light (non-decoupled) dark Higgs particle. In this work, we study the impact of such a dark Higgs particle in the collider detection of the dark photon. We focus on the process of final state dark photon radiating dark Higgs, which is called dark final state radiation (FSR). Considering the effects on both the signal cross section and the distribution of the missing mass square, the invisible dark photon search at BaBar is reanalyzed and a new exclusion limit for invisible dark photon is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological charge density two-point function is computed in a three-flavor effective linear meson model, including contributions from topological sectors with arbitrary charge. A corresponding composite field is introduced via a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In the $\eta$-$\eta$' sector, the model yields very accurate spectroscopy with negligible mixing with the composite field. The resulting topological susceptibility allows for the extraction of a surprisingly large absolute scale for the range of topological fluctuations. When compared with various QCD-based estimates, this indirectly suggests the dominance of higher topologically charged configurations in the ground state.</description>

Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is a celebrated laboratory in searches for gamma-ray flashes produced by the radiative decay of sub-GeV particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and novel gauge bosons. At large couplings, however, particles decay rapidly inside the stellar envelope, which results in a suppression of the signal. Focusing on the prototypical example of ALPs with a photon coupling, we show that core-collapse SNe of Type Ic are much less affected by this attenuation, thanks to the compactness of their progenitors ensuing from the loss of their envelope. While Fermi-LAT may miss the brief gamma-ray flash from a single Type Ic SN, their high rate allows for a statistical approach: by stacking many events, we can obtain constraints that significantly surpass those from SN 1987A at large couplings. Our approach can be extended to any feebly interacting particle featuring a decay channel into photons.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD Prediction of the Hyperon EDM from CP-violating Dipole Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) of baryons provides a sensitive probe of CP-violating interactions beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by the recent BESIII measurement on the $\Lambda$-hyperon EDM [1], we present the first perturbative QCD analysis of the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to elucidate its origin in CP-violating quark dipole interactions. In particular, we derive a QCD factorization formula that relates the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to quark EDMs and chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) through convolutions with the light-cone distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$. These connections allow us to extract constraints on CP-violating dipole couplings from current and future hyperon EDM measurements. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the $\Lambda$ EDM exhibits unique sensitivity to the strange-quark CEDM, providing complementary information to that obtained from the neutron EDM.</description>

      <title>Beyond scalar QED radiative corrections: the $\rho^{\pm}-\rho^0$ width difference, FSR corrections and their impact on $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm HVP, LO}[\tau]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper arXiv:0708.3256 [hep-ph] we have calculated the radiative corrections to $\rho \to \pi\pi$ decays, aiming to estimate the width difference between charged and neutral rho mesons. There, we have used the scalar QED approximation and taken the convection terms to keep the loop contributions finite in the case of charged rho meson decays. Here we compute the radiative corrections by considering the electromagnetic structure of charged mesons and we also include the full Lorentz structure of the electromagnetic vertices. We re-evaluate the width difference of $\rho^{\pm}-\rho^0$ vector mesons and calculate the structure-dependent contributions to Final State Radiation terms in the $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross section. Both effects are important inputs for evaluating the isospin breaking corrections in the dominant hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g-2$ when using $\tau$ lepton data.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM). Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Characterized behaviors of black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comprehension of universal thermodynamic behaviors in the supercritical region is crucial for examining the characteristics of black hole systems under high temperature and pressure. This study is devoted to the analysis of characteristic lines and crossover behaviors within the supercritical region. By making use of the free energy, we introduce three key thermodynamic quantities: scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Our results demonstrate that the Widom line, associated with the maximal scaled variance, can effectively differentiate between small and large black hole-like subphases, each displaying distinct thermodynamic behaviors within the supercritical region. Furthermore, by utilizing quasinormal modes, we identify the Frenkel line, offering a dynamic perspective to distinguish between small and large black hole-like subphases. These contribute to a deeper comprehension of black hole subphases in the supercritical region, thus illuminating new facets of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

      <title>GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</description>

      <title>Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</description>
