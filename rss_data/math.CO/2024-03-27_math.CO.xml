      <title>Finitely generated dyadic convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyadic rationals are rationals whose denominator is a power of $2$. We define dyadic $n$-dimensional convex sets as the intersections with $n$-dimensional dyadic space of an $n$-dimensional real convex set. Such a dyadic convex set is said to be a dyadic $n$-dimensional polytope if the real convex set is a polytope whose vertices lie in the dyadic space. Dyadic convex sets are described as subreducts (subalgebras of reducts) of certain faithful affine spaces over the ring of dyadic numbers, or equivalently as commutative, entropic and idempotent groupoids under the binary operation of arithmetic mean.
  The paper contains two main results. First, it is proved that, while all dyadic polytopes are finitely generated, only dyadic simplices are generated by their vertices. This answers a question formulated in an earlier paper. Then, a characterization of finitely generated subgroupoids of dyadic convex sets is provided, and it is shown how to use the characterization to determine the minimal number of generators of certain convex subsets of the dyadic plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham proposed to determine the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s = 1$ and asked, among other things, whether that number could be as large as $2^{n - o(n)}$. We show that the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s \leq 1$ is smaller than $2^{0.93n}$.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and cycles of parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parking function of length $n$ is a sequence $\pi=(\pi_1,\dots, \pi_n)$ of positive integers such that if $\lambda_1\leq\cdots\leq \lambda_n$ is the increasing rearrangement of $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_n$, then $\lambda_i\leq i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. In this paper we obtain some exact results on the number of fixed points and cycles of parking functions. Our proofs will be based on generalizations of Pollak's argument. Extensions of our techniques are discussed.</description>

      <title>Best possible upper bounds on the restrained domination number of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set in a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus S$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$. A restrained dominating set of $G$ is a dominating set $S$ with the additional restraint that the graph $G - S$ obtained by removing all vertices in $S$ is isolate-free. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ and the restrained domination number $\gamma_{r}(G)$ are the minimum cardinalities of a dominating set and restrained dominating set, respectively, of $G$. Let $G$ be a cubic graph of order~$n$. A classical result of Reed [Combin. Probab. Comput. 5 (1996), 277--295] states that $\gamma(G) \le \frac{3}{8}n$, and this bound is best possible. To determine a best possible upper bound on the restrained domination number of $G$ is more challenging, and we prove that $\gamma_{r}(G) \le \frac{2}{5}n$.</description>

      <title>Worpitzky-compatible sets and the freeness of arrangements between Shi and Catalan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an irreducible root system, the Worpitzky-compatible subsets are defined by a geometric property of the alcoves inside the fundamental parallelepiped of the root system. This concept is motivated and mainly understood through a lattice point counting formula concerning the characteristic and Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. In this paper, we show that the Worpitzky-compatibility has a simple combinatorial characterization in terms of roots. As a byproduct, we obtain a complete characterization by means of Worpitzky-compatibility for the freeness of the arrangements interpolating between the extended Shi and Catalan arrangements. This is a completion of the earlier result by Yoshinaga in 2010 which was done for simply-laced root systems.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture on Rainbow Hamiltonian Cycle Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wu in 1999 conjectured that if $H$ is a subgraph of the complete graph $K_{2n+1}$ with $n$ edges, then there is a Hamiltonian cycle decomposition of $K_{2n+1}$ such that each edge of $H$ is in a separate Hamiltonian cycle. The conjecture was partially settled by Liu and Chen (2023) in cases that $|V(H)|\leq n+1$, $H$ is a linear forest, or $n\leq 5$. In this paper, we settle the conjecture completely. This result can be viewed as a complete graph analogous of Evans conjecture and has some applications in linear arboricity conjecture and restricted size Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>So Long Sucker: Endgame Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So Long Sucker is a strategy board game requiring 4 players, each with $c$ chips of their designated color, and a board made of $k$ empty piles. With a clear set-up come intricate rules, such as: players taking turns but not in a fixed order, agreements between some players being made and broken at any time, and a player winning the game even without any chips in hand.
  One of the main points of interest in studying this game, is finding when a player has a winning strategy. The game begins with four players that get eliminated successively until the winner is left. To study winning strategies, it is of interest to look at endgame situations. We present the following game set-up: there are two players left in the game, Blue and Red, and only their respective chip colors. In this paper, we characterize Blue's winning situations and strategies through inductive reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bijection between two well-known objects in the ubiquitous Catalan family: non-decreasing parking functions and {\L}ukasiewicz paths. This bijection maps the maximal displacement of a parking function to the height of the corresponding {\L}ukasiewicz path, and the total displacement to the area of the path. We also study this bijection restricted to two specific families of parking-functions: unit-interval parking functions, and prime parking functions.</description>

      <title>Properties of graphs of neural codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural code on $ n $ neurons is a collection of subsets of the set $ [n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\} $. In this paper, we study some properties of graphs of neural codes. In particular, we study codeword containment graph (CCG) given by Chan et al. (SIAM J. on Dis. Math., 37(1):114-145,2017) and general relationship graph (GRG) given by Gross et al. (Adv. in App. Math., 95:65-95, 2018). We provide a sufficient condition for CCG to be connected. We also show that the connectedness and completeness of CCG are preserved under surjective morphisms between neural codes defined by A. Jeffs (SIAM J. on App. Alg. and Geo., 4(1):99-122,2020). Further, we show that if CCG of any neural code $\mathcal{C}$ is complete with $|\mathcal{C}|=m$, then $\mathcal{C} \cong \{\emptyset,1,12,\dots,123\cdots m\}$ as neural codes. We also prove that a code whose CCG is complete is open convex. Later, we show that if a code $\mathcal{C}$ with $|\mathcal{C}|&gt;3$ has its CCG to be connected 2-regular then $|\mathcal{C}| $ is even. The GRG was defined only for degree two neural codes using the canonical forms of its neural ideal. We first define GRG for any neural code. Then, we show the behaviour of GRGs under the various elementary code maps. At last, we compare these two graphs for certain classes of codes and see their properties.</description>

      <title>A Caro-Wei bound for induced linear forests in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result due to Caro (1979) and Wei (1981) states that every graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{1}{d(v) + 1}$, where $d(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$. Alon, Kahn, and Seymour (1987) showed the following generalization: For every $k\geq 0$, every graph $G$ has a $k$-degenerate induced subgraph with at least $\sum_{v \in V(G)}\min\{1, \frac {k+1}{d(v)+1}\}$ vertices. In particular, for $k=1$, every graph $G$ with no isolated vertices has an induced forest with at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{2}{d(v) + 1}$ vertices. Akbari, Amanihamedani, Mousavi, Nikpey, and Sheybani (2019) conjectured that, if $G$ has minimum degree at least $2$, then one can even find an induced linear forest of that order in $G$, that is, a forest where each component is a path.
  In this paper, we prove this conjecture and show a number of related results. In particular, if there is no restriction on the minimum degree of $G$, we show that there are infinitely many ``best possible'' functions $f$ such that $\sum_{v\in V(G)} f(d(v))$ is a lower bound on the maximum order of a linear forest in $G$, and we give a full characterization of all such functions $f$.</description>

      <title>A method of constructing pairwise balanced designs containing parallel classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The obvious way to construct a GDD (group-divisible design) recursively is to use Wilson's Fundamental Construction for GDDs (WFC). Then a PBD (pairwise balanced design) is often obtained by adding a new point to each group of the GDD. However, after constructing such a PBD, it might be the case that we then want to identify a parallel class of blocks. In this short note, we explore some possible ways of doing this.</description>

      <title>Tutte polynomials of matroids as universal valuative invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a full classification of all families of matroids that are closed under duality and minors, and for which the Tutte polynomial is a universal valuative invariant. There are four inclusion-wise maximal families, two of which are the class of elementary split matroids and the class of graphic Schubert matroids. As a consequence of our framework, we derive new properties of Tutte polynomials of arbitrary matroids. Among other results, we show that the Tutte polynomial of every matroid can be expressed uniquely as an integral combination of Tutte polynomials of graphic Schubert matroids.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree. II. Triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\textit{identifying code}$ of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhood and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every connected closed-twin-free graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+c$. In a companion paper, we proved the conjecture for all trees. We show that the conjecture holds for all triangle-free graphs, with the same lists of exceptional graphs needing $c&gt;0$ as for trees: for $\Delta\ge 3$, $c=1/3$ suffices and there is only a set of 12 trees requiring $c&gt;0$ for $\Delta=3$, and when $\Delta\ge 4$ this set is reduced to the $\Delta$-star only. Our proof is by induction, whose starting point is the above result for trees. Along the way, we prove a generalized version of Bondy's theorem on induced subsets [J. A. Bondy. Induced subsets. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 1972] that we use as a tool in our proofs. We also use our main result for triangle-free graphs, to prove the upper bound $\left( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} \right) n+1/\Delta+4t$ for graphs that can be made triangle-free by the removal of $t$ edges.</description>

      <title>Beyond chromatic threshold via $(p,q)$-theorem, and sharp blow-up phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel connection between the well-known chromatic threshold problem in extremal combinatorics and the celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem in discrete geometry. In particular, for a graph $G$ with bounded clique number and a natural density condition, we prove a $(p,q)$-theorem for an abstract convexity space associated with $G$. Our result strengthens those of Thomassen and Nikiforov on the chromatic threshold of cliques. Our $(p,q)$-theorem can also be viewed as a $\chi$-boundedness result for (what we call) ultra maximal $K_r$-free graphs.
  We further show that the graphs under study are blow-ups of constant size graphs, improving a result of Oberkampf and Schacht on homomorphism threshold of cliques. Our result unravels the cause underpinning such a blow-up phenomenon, differentiating the chromatic and homomorphism threshold problems for cliques. Our result implies that for the homomorphism threshold problem, rather than the minimum degree condition usually considered in the literature, the decisive factor is a clique density condition on co-neighborhoods of vertices. More precisely, we show that if an $n$-vertex $K_{r}$-free graph $G$ satisfies that the common neighborhood of every pair of non-adjacent vertices induces a subgraph with $K_{r-2}$-density at least $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then $G$ must be a blow-up of some $K_r$-free graph $F$ on at most $2^{O(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ vertices. Furthermore, this single exponential bound is optimal. We construct examples with no $K_r$-free homomorphic image of size smaller than $2^{\Omega_r(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^p$ Amplitudes from the Positive Tropical Grassmannian: Triangulations of Extended Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global Schwinger formula, introduced by Cachazo and Early as a single integral over the positive tropical Grassmannian, provides a way to uncover properties of scattering amplitudes which are hard to see in their standard Feynman diagram formulation. In a recent work, Cachazo and one of the authors extended the global Schwinger formula to general $\phi^p$ theories. When $p=4$, it was conjectured that the integral decomposes as a sum over cones which are in bijection with non-crossing chord diagrams, and further that these can be obtained by finding the zeroes of a piece-wise linear function, $H(x)$. In this note we give a proof of this conjecture. We also present a purely combinatorial way of computing $\phi^p$ amplitudes by triangulating a trivial extended version of non-crossing $(p-2)$-chord diagrams, called extended diagrams, and present a proof of the bijection between triangulated extended diagrams and Feynman diagrams when $p=4$. This is reminiscent of recent constructions using Stokes polytopes and accordiohedra. However, the $\phi^p$ amplitude is now partitioned by a new collection of objects, each of which characterizes a polyhedral cone in the positive tropical Grassmannian in the form of an associahedron or of an intersection of two associahedra. Moreover, we comment on the bijection between extended diagrams and double-ordered biadjoint scalar amplitudes. We also conjecture the form of the general piece-wise linear function, $H^{\phi^p}(x)$, whose zeroes generate the regions in which the $\phi^p$ global Schwinger formula decomposes into.</description>

      <title>Comparing Hilbert depth of $I$ with Hilbert depth of $S/I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a monomial ideal of $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. We show that the following are equivalent: (i) $I$ is principal, (ii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)=n$, (iii) $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)=n-1$.
  Assuming that $I$ is squarefree, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)\leq 3$ or $n\leq 5$ then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)+1$. Also, we prove that if $\operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)=4$ or $n\leq 6$ then then $\operatorname{hdepth}(I)\geq \operatorname{hdepth}(S/I)$.</description>

      <title>Free Sets in Planar Graphs: History and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a planar graph $G$ is a free set if, for every set $P$ of $|S|$ points in the plane, there exists a straight-line crossing-free drawing of $G$ in which vertices of $S$ are mapped to distinct points in $P$. In this survey, we review
  - several equivalent definitions of free sets, - results on the existence of large free sets in planar graphs and subclasses of planar graphs, - and applications of free sets in graph drawing.
  The survey concludes with a list of open problems in this still very active research area.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Generation of Finite Almost Simple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if G is a sufficiently large finite almost simple group of Lie type, then given a fixed nontrivial element x in G and a coset of G modulo its socle, the probability that x and a random element of the coset generate a subgroup containing the socle is uniformly bounded away from 0 (and goes to 1 if the field size goes to infinity). This is new even if G is simple. Together with results of Lucchini and Burness--Guralnick--Harper, this proves a conjecture of Lucchini and has an application to profinite groups. A key step in the proof is the determination of the limits for the proportion of elements in a classical group which fix no subspace of any bounded dimension.</description>

      <title>Geometric planted matchings beyond the Gaussian model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an unknown matching between a set of $n$ randomly placed points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and random perturbations of these points. This can be seen as a model for particle tracking and more generally, entity resolution. We use matchings in random geometric graphs to derive minimax lower bounds for this problem that hold under great generality. Using these results we show that for a broad class of distributions, the order of the number of mistakes made by an estimator that minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances is minimax optimal when $d$ is fixed and is optimal up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors when $d = o(\log n)$. In the high-dimensional regime we consider a setup where both initial positions and perturbations have independent sub-Gaussian coordinates. In this setup we give sufficient conditions under which the same estimator makes no mistakes with high probability. We prove an analogous result for an adapted version of this estimator that incorporates information on the covariance matrix of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic computations of tropical refined invariants in genus 0 and 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block and G\"ottsche introduced a Laurent polynomial multiplicity to count tropical curves. Itenberg and Mikhalkin then showed that this multiplicity leads to invariant counts called tropical refined invariants. Recently, Brugall\'e and Jaramillo-Puentes studied the polynomiality properties of the coefficients of these invariants and showed that for fixed genus g, the coefficients ultimately coincide with polynomials in the homology class of the curves we look at. We call the generating series of these polynomials asymptotic refined invariant. In genus 0, the asymptotic refined invariant has been computed by the second author in the h-transverse case.
  In this paper, we give a new proof of the formula for the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 0 using variations on the floor diagram algorithm. This technique allows also to compute the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 1. The result exhibits surprising regularity properties related to the generating series of partition numbers and quasi-modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear codes play a central role in coding theory and have applications in several branches of mathematics. For error correction purposes the minimum Hamming distance should be as large as possible. Linear codes related to applications in Galois Geometry often require a certain divisibility of the occurring weights. In this paper we present an algorithmic framework for the classification of linear codes over finite fields with restricted sets of weights. The underlying algorithms are based on lattice point enumeration and integer linear programming. We present new enumeration and non-existence results for projective two-weight codes, divisible codes, and additive $\mathbb{F}_4$-codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural code on $ n $ neurons is a collection of subsets of the set $ [n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\} $. Curto et al. \cite{curto2013neural} associated a ring $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{C}}$ (neural ring) to a neural code $\mathcal{C}$. A special class of ring homomorphisms between two neural rings, called neural ring homomorphism, was introduced by Curto and Youngs \cite{curto2020neural}. The main work in this paper comprises constructing two categories. First is the $\mathfrak{C}$ category, a subcategory of SETS consisting of neural codes and code maps. Second is the neural category $\mathfrak{N}$, a subcategory of \textit{Rngs} consisting of neural rings and neural ring homomorphisms. Then, the rest of the paper characterizes the properties of these two categories like initial and final objects, products, coproducts, limits, etc. Also, we show that these two categories are in dual equivalence.</description>

      <title>Tactical decompositions in finite polar spaces and non-spreading classical group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For finite classical groups acting naturally on the set of points of their ambient polar spaces, the symmetry properties of \emph{synchronising} and \emph{separating} are equivalent to natural and well-studied problems on the existence of certain configurations in finite geometry. The more general class of \emph{spreading} permutation groups is harder to describe, and it is the purpose of this paper to explore this property for finite classical groups. In particular, we show that for most finite classical groups, their natural action on the points of its polar space is non-spreading. We develop and use a result on tactical decompositions (an \emph{AB-Lemma}) that provides a useful technique for finding witnesses for non-spreading permutation groups. We also consider some of the other primitive actions of the classical groups.</description>

      <title>Generalising the maximum independent set algorithm via Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph starts with the empty set and visits every vertex, adding it to the set if and only if none of its neighbours are already in the set. In this paper, we consider the generalisation of this MIS algorithm by letting it start with any set of vertices and we prove the hardness of many decision problems related to this generalisation. Our results are based on two main strategies. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network, which we refer to as the MIS network, according to a permutation of the vertex set. The set of fixed points of the MIS network corresponds to the set of MIS of the graph. Our generalisation then consists in starting from any configuration and following a sequential update given by a word of vertices. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a colony of a graph, that is a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Deciding whether a set of vertices is a colony is NP-complete; decision problems related to the MIS algorithm will be reduced from the Colony problem. We first show that deciding whether a configuration can reach all maximal independent sets is coNP-complete. Second, we consider so-called fixing words, that allow to reach a MIS for any initial configuration, and fixing permutations, which we call permises; deciding whether a permutation is fixing is coNP-complete. Third, we show that deciding whether a graph has a permis is coNP-hard. Finally, we generalise the MIS algorithm to digraphs. The algorithm then uses the so-called kernel network, whose fixed points are the kernels of the digraph. Deciding whether the kernel network of a given digraph is fixable is coNP-hard, even for digraphs that have a kernel. Alternatively, we introduce two fixable Boolean networks whose sets of fixed points contain all kernels.</description>

      <title>Intersecting subsets in finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset (subgroup) $S$ of a transitive permutation group $G\leq Sym(\Omega)$ is called an intersecting subset (subgroup, resp.) if the ratio $xy^{-1}$ of any elements $x,y\in S$ fixes some point. A transitive group is said to have the EKR property if the size of each intersecting subset is at most the order of the point stabilizer. A nice result of Meagher-Spiga-Tiep (2016) says that 2-transitive permutation groups have the EKR property. In this paper, we systematically study intersecting subsets in more general transitive permutation groups, including primitive (quasiprimitive) groups, rank-3 groups, Suzuki groups, and some special solvable groups. We present new families of groups that have the EKR property, and various families of groups that do not have the EKR property. This paper significantly improves the unpublished version of this paper, and particularly solves Problem 1.4 of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the definition of $V$-stability conditions, given by Viviani in a recent preprint, we introduce the notion of \emph{universal stability conditions}. Building on results by Pagani and Tommasi, we show that fine compactified universal Jacobians, that is, fine compactified Jacobians over the moduli spaces of stable pointed curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, are combinatorially classified by universal stability conditions.
  We use these stability conditions to show the following. The inclusion of fine compactified universal Jacobians of type $(g,n)$ whose fibres over geometric points are classical, that is, they are constructed by some numerical polarisation, into the class of all fine compactified universal Jacobians, is strict, in general, for any $g\geq 2$. This answers a question of Pagani and Tommasi.</description>

This generalizes the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem of the case k=1. The proof relies on poissonization and a connection with variants of the Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis particle system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph $G$ is called properly colored if every two adjacent edges are assigned different colors. A monochromatic triangle is a cycle of length 3 with all the edges having the same color. Given a tree $T_0$, let $\mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$ be the collection of $n$-vertex trees that are subdivisions of $T_0$. It is conjectured that for each fixed tree $T_0$ of $k$ edges, there is a function $f(k)$ such that for each integer $n\geq f(k)$ and each $T\in \mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$, every edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ without containing monochromatic triangle must contain a properly colored copy of $T$. We confirm the conjecture in the case that $T_0$ is a star. A weaker version of the above conjecture is also obtained. Moreover, to get a nice quantitative estimation of $f(k)$ requires determining the constraint Ramsey number of a monochromatic triangle and a rainbow $k$-star, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the k-core of a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very sparse random graphs are known to typically be singular (i.e., have singular adjacency matrix), due to the presence of "low-degree dependencies'' such as isolated vertices and pairs of degree-1 vertices with the same neighbourhood. We prove that these kinds of dependencies are in some sense the only causes of singularity: for constants $k\ge 3$ and $\lambda &gt; 0$, an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $G\sim\mathbb{G}(n,\lambda/n)$ with $n$ vertices and edge probability $\lambda/n$ typically has the property that its $k$-core (its largest subgraph with minimum degree at least $k$) is nonsingular. This resolves a conjecture of Vu from the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians, and adds to a short list of known nonsingularity theorems for "extremely sparse'' random matrices with density $O(1/n)$. A key aspect of our proof is a technique to extract high-degree vertices and use them to "boost'' the rank, starting from approximate rank bounds obtainable from (non-quantitative) spectral convergence machinery due to Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez.</description>

      <title>Tropical curves in abelian surfaces III: pearl diagrams and multiple cover formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the third installment in a series of papers devoted to the computation of enumerative invariants of abelian surfaces through the tropical approach. We develop a pearl diagram algorithm similar to the floor diagram algorithm used in toric surfaces that concretely solves the tropical problem.
  These diagrams can be used to prove specific cases of Oberdieck's multiple cover formula that reduce the computation of invariants for non-primitive classes to the primitive case, getting rid of all diagram considerations and providing short explicit formulas. The latter can be used to prove the quasi-modularity of generating series of classical invariants, and the polynomiality of coefficients of fixed codegree in the refined invariants.</description>

      <title>On cubic-line arrangements with simple singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present note we study combinatorial and algebraic properties of cubic-line arrangements in the complex projective plane admitting nodes, ordinary triple and $A_{5}$ singular points. We deliver a Hirzebruch-type inequality for such arrangement and we study the freeness of such arrangements providing an almost complete classification.</description>

      <title>Calculus of variations on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates'' for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}$ problems.
  In this work, we give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, we extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, we give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>
