      <title>Almost-Exact Simulation Scheme for Heston-type Models: Bermudan and American Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an Almost-Exact Simulation (AES) scheme was introduced for the Heston stochastic volatility model and tested for European option pricing. This paper extends this scheme for pricing Bermudan and American options under both Heston and double Heston models. The AES improves Monte Carlo simulation efficiency by using the non-central chi-square distribution for the variance process. We derive the AES scheme for the double Heston model and compare the performance of the AES schemes under both models with the Euler scheme. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the AES scheme in providing accurate option prices with reduced computational time, highlighting its robustness for both models. In particular, the AES achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency when the number of simulation steps matches the exercise dates for Bermudan options.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Option Hedging: Static Implied-Volatility Fit versus Shortfall-Aware Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Q-learner in Black-Scholes (QLBS) framework by incorporating risk aversion and trading costs, and propose a novel Replication Learning of Option Pricing (RLOP) approach. Both methods are fully compatible with standard reinforcement learning algorithms and operate under market frictions. Using SPY and XOP option data, we evaluate performance along static and dynamic dimensions. Adaptive-QLBS achieves higher static pricing accuracy in implied volatility space, while RLOP delivers superior dynamic hedging performance by reducing shortfall probability. These results highlight the importance of evaluating option pricing models beyond static fit, emphasizing realized hedging outcomes.</description>

      <title>European Options in Market Models with Multiple Defaults: the BSDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-linear Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and p default martingales. The driver of the BSDE with multiple default jumps can take a generalized form involving an optional finite variation process. We first show existence and uniqueness. We then establish comparison and strict comparison results for these BSDEs, under a suitable assumption on the driver. In the case of a linear driver, we derive an explicit formula for the first component of the BSDE using an adjoint exponential semimartingale. The representation depends on whether the finite variation process is predictable or only optional. We apply our results to the problem of pricing and hedging a European option in a linear complete market with two defaultable assets and in a non-linear complete market with p defaultable assets. Two examples of the latter market model are provided: an example where the seller of the option is a large investor influencing the probability of default of a single asset and an example where the large seller's strategy affects the default probabilities of all p assets.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>
