      <title>Corrigendum to "Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory'' [arXiv:2305.02973, Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci. 26:3#13 (2024)]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this corrigendum to arXiv:2305.02973, we justify that the motivation behind Conjecture 5.1 is based on a mistaken notion. Moreover, we prove a stronger theorem that disproves the conjecture, and obtain an optimal gradient vector field on the matching complex of the complete graph of order 7.</description>

      <title>Inversions in Colored Permutations, Derangements, and Involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arslan, Altoum, and Zaarour introduced an inversion statistic for generalized symmetric groups. In this work, we study the distribution of this statistic over colored permutations, including derangements and involutions. By establishing a bijective correspondence between colored permutations and colored Lehmer codes, we develop a unified framework for enumerating colored Mahonian numbers and analyzing their combinatorial properties. We derive explicit formulas, recurrence relations, and generating functions for the number of inversions in these families, extending classical results to the colored setting. We conclude with explicit expressions for inversions in colored derangements and involutions.</description>

      <title>The Satisfiability Threshold for K-XOR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $K$-XORGAME system corresponds to a $K$-XORSAT system with the additional restriction that the variables divide uniformly into $K$ blocks. This forms a system of $m$ equations with $K n$ unknowns over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and a perfect strategy corresponds to a solution to these equations. Equivalently, such equations correspond to colorings of a $K$-uniform $K$-partite hypergraph. This paper proves that the satisfiability threshold of $m/n$ for $K$-XORGAME problems exists and equals the satisfiability threshold for $K$-XORSAT.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Even-Valent Graphs on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for determining the topological expansion of the recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials with weights of the form \( e^{-N\mathscr{V}(z)} \), where \( \mathscr{V}(z) = \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{u z^{2\nu}}{2\nu} \) with \( u &gt; 0 \) and \( \nu \in \mathbb{N} \). A key feature of our approach is that it is non-recursive in \( \nu \). For fixed choices of vertices, $j$, and genus, $g$, our expansion yields closed-form formulae in $\nu$ which in turn count the number of connected \( 2\nu \)-valent labeled graphs (and their 2-legged counterparts) with \( j \) vertices on a compact Riemann surface of genus \( g \).
  We also outline the steps required to extend the methodology of \cite{BGM} to hexic weights, where \( \mathscr{V}(z) = \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{u z^6}{6} \). This enables us to derive closed-form formulae in $j$ for the number of connected 6-valent labeled graphs with \( j \) vertices on a compact Riemann surface of genus \( g \), for \( g = 0, 1, \) and \( 2 \). Note the difference to our new method which instead holds for general $\nu$ and fixed $j$.</description>

      <title>Paired domination in graphs with minimum degree four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a paired dominating set if every vertex of $G$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ admits a perfect matching. The minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of $G$ is the paired domination number $\gpr(G)$ of $G$. We show that if $G$ is a graph of order~$n$ and $\delta(G) \ge 4$, then $\gpr(G) \le \frac{10}{17}n &lt; 0.5883 n$.</description>

      <title>The Zero Forcing Number of Twisted Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted hypercubes are graphs that generalize the structure of the hypercube by relaxing the symmetry constraint while maintaining degree-regularity and connectivity. We study the zero forcing number of twisted hypercubes. Zero forcing is a graph infection process in which a particular colour change rule is iteratively applied to the graph and an initial set of vertices. We use the alternative framing of forcing arc sets to construct a family of twisted hypercubes of dimension k$\geq 3$ with zero forcing sets of size $2^{k-1}-2^{k-3}+1$, which is below the minimum zero forcing number of the hypercube.</description>

      <title>On two conjectures about pattern avoidance of cyclic permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi$ be a cyclic permutation that can be expressed in its one-line form as $\pi = \pi_1\pi_2 \cdot\cdot\cdot \pi_n$ and in its standard cycle form as $\pi = (c_1,c_2, ..., c_n)$ where $c_1=1$. Archer et al. introduced the notion of pattern avoidance of one-line and the standard cycle form for a cyclic permutation $\pi$, defined as both $\pi_1\pi_2 \cdot\cdot\cdot \pi_n$ and its standard cycle form $c_1c_2\cdot\cdot\cdot c_{n}$ avoiding a given pattern. Let $\mathcal{A}_n(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_k; \tau)$ denote the set of cyclic permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$ that avoid each pattern of $\{\sigma_1,...,\sigma_k\}$ in their one-line forms and avoid $\tau$ in their standard cycle forms. In this paper, we obtain some results about the cyclic permutations avoiding patterns in both one-line and cycle forms. In particular, we resolve two conjectures of Archer et al.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of Macbeath-Hurwitz and related maps and surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Macbeath-Hurwitz maps $\mathcal M$ of type $\{3,7\}$, obtained from the Hurwitz groups $G={\rm PSL}_2(q)$ found by Macbeath, are fully regular by a result of Singerman, with automorphism group $G\times{\rm C}_2$ or ${\rm PGL}_2(q)$. Hall's criterion determines which of these two properties, called inner and outer regularity, $\mathcal M$ has. Inner (but not outer) regular maps $\mathcal M$ yield non-orientable regular maps ${\mathcal M}/{\rm C}_2$ of the same type with automorphism group $G$. If $q=p^3$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 2$ or $\pm 3$ mod~$(7)$ the unique map $\mathcal M$ is inner regular if and only if $p\equiv 1$ mod~$(4)$. If $q=p$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 1$ mod~$(7)$ there are three maps $\mathcal M$; we use the density theorems of Frobenius and Chebotarev to show that in this case the sets of such primes $p$ for which $0, 1, 2$ or $3$ of them are inner regular have relative densities $1/8$, $3/8$, $3/8$ and $1/8$ respectively. Hall's criterion and its consequences are extended to the analogous Macbeath maps of type $\{3,n\}$ obtained from ${\rm PSL}_2(q)$ for all $n\ge 7$; theoretical predictions on their number and properties are supported by evidence from the map databases of Conder and Poto\v cnik.</description>

      <title>Paired 2-disjoint path covers of Bcube under the partitioned edge fault model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BCube network, as a typical distributed data center network topology, has significant advantages in fault tolerance, load balancing, and efficient routing due to its unique hierarchical structure. In terms of efficient routing, paired many-to-many m-disjoint path cover (m-DPC) plays an important role in message passing. To explore the capability of BCube in constructing paired many-to-many m-DPCs, this paper investigates whether arbitrary 2-DPC paths can be successfully constructed under the partitioned edge fault (PEF) model, especially in the case of a large number of link failures. Through this investigation, the paper aims to address the network fault tolerance issues related to path embedding problems. Theoretical proofs show that under the partitioned edge fault model, BCube exhibits exponential fault tolerance for constructing 2-DPC paths. This study, on one hand, expands the application of the partitioned edge fault model, and on the other hand, contributes to enhancing BCube's ability to achieve large-scale edge fault tolerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The master theorem, introduced independently by Richter-Gebert and by Fomin and the first author, provides a method for proving incidence theorems of projective geometry using triangular tilings of surfaces. We investigate which incidence theorems over C and R can or cannot be proved via the master theorem. For this, we formalize the notion of a tiling proof. We introduce a hierarchy of classes of theorems based on the underlying topological spaces. A key tool is considering the same theorems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Minimal Simplicial Degree $d$ Maps from Genus $g$ Surfaces to the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology, offering deep insights into the structure of the manifolds and the nature of the corresponding maps. This concept has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$ orientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.
  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces, have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex triangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a triangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus for $g \geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$ when $g = 1,2$. If $g \geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d| \geq 2g - 1$.
  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology, as it leads to several intriguing open problems. In the final section, we propose some of these open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider A to be a commutative, integral and non-degenerate residuated lattice. In this work, we introduce the graph of comaximal filters on the residuated lattice A. We willdenote by Cf(A) this graph for which the set of vertices are proper filters of A which are not contained in the radical of A, and the adjacency relation on vertices is given as: consider two filters F and G, there are adjacent if and only if F v G; the filter generated by F u G is equal to A. The elementary properties of this graph are provided, we establish a link between this comaximal filter graphs and the zero-divisor graphs. Furthermore, we investigate the chromatic number, the clique number, the planarity and the perfection of the graph Cf(A). We also briefly describe all the comaximal filter graphs constructed on specific residuated lattices of small size.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trades are important objects in combinatorial design theory that may be realized as certain elements of kernels of inclusion matrices. Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\Gamma,+)$ be an Abelian group of order $n^2$ and MS$_{\Gamma}(n)$ be an $n\times n$ array whose entries are all elements of $\Gamma$. Then MS$_{\Gamma}(n)$ is a $\Gamma$-magic square if all row, column, main and backward main diagonal sums are equal to the same element $\mu\in\Gamma$. We prove that for every Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $n^2$, $n&gt;2$, there exists a magic square MS$_{\Gamma}(n)$ where the square entries are elements of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Bounded diameter variations of Ryser's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study bounded diameter variations of the following form of Ryser's conjecture. For every graph $G=(V,E)$ with independence number $\alpha(G)=\alpha$ and integer $r\geq 2$, in every $r$-edge coloring of $G$ there is a cover of $V(G)$ by the vertices of $(r-1)\alpha$ monochromatic connected components. Mili\'{c}evi\'{c} initiated the question whether the diameters of the covering components can be bounded.
  For any graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$ we show that in every 2-coloring of the edges, $V(G)$ can be covered by the vertices of two monochromatic subgraphs of diameter at most 4. This improves a result of DeBiasio et al., which in turn improved a result of Mili\'{c}evi\'{c}. It remains open whether diameter $4$ can be strengthened to diameter $3$, we could do this only for certain graphs, including odd antiholes.
  We propose also a somewhat orthogonal aspect of the problem. Suppose that we fix the diameter $d$ of the monochromatic components, how many do we need to cover the vertex set? For $d=2,2\le r \le 3$, the exact answer is $r\alpha$ and for $d=4,r=2$, we prove the upper bound $\lfloor 3\alpha/2\rfloor$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by algorithmic applications, Kun, O'Brien, Pilipczuk, and Sullivan introduced the parameter linear chromatic number as a relaxation of treedepth and proved that the two parameters are polynomially related. They conjectured that treedepth could be bounded from above by twice the linear chromatic number.
  In this paper we investigate the properties of linear chromatic number and provide improved bounds in several graph classes.</description>

      <title>Topological bounds, odd subdivisions and odd immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analogue of Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion order states that every graph $G$ contains $K_{\chi(G)}$ as an immersion. Our work is motivated by a strengthening of this conjecture which asserts that every graph $G$ contains $K_{\chi(G)}$ as a totally odd immersion. As evidence for this strengthened conjecture and inspired by a result of Steiner (2024), we show that if the chromatic number of $G$ is equal to any of its topological lower bounds, then $G$ contains a totally odd immersion of $K_{\lfloor \chi(G)/2 \rfloor +1}$.
  Kneser and Generalised Mycielski graphs are canonical examples of graphs satisfying such equalities for their chromatic numbers. Simonyi and Zsb\'an (2010) showed that every Kneser graph $G$ with large enough order (compared to $\chi(G)$) contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$, thus satisfying the motivating conjecture in a strong sense. We show that, in fact, for every $t\ge 8$, there are $t$-chromatic Kneser graphs that contain arbitrarily large complete totally odd subdivisions. We also study totally odd subdivisions and immersions in Generalised Mycielski graphs, in particular showing that these graphs cannot be minimum counterexamples to the motivating conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Arboricity Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new matroid (graph) invariant, the arboricity polynomial. Given a matroid, the arboricity polynomial enumerates the number of covers of the ground set by disjoint independent sets. We establish the polynomiality of the counting function as a special case of a scheduling polynomial, i.e. both in terms of quasisymmetric functions and via Ehrhart theory of the nromal fan of the matroid base polytope. We show basic properties of the polynomial and demonstrate that it is not a Tutte invariant. Namely, the arboricity polynomial does not satisfy a contraction / deletion recursion.</description>

      <title>More efficient sifting for grid norms, and applications to multiparty communication complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the techniques behind the recent progress on the 3-term arithmetic progression problem [KM'23], Kelley, Lovett, and Meka [KLM'24] constructed the first explicit 3-player function $f:[N]^3 \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that demonstrates a strong separation between randomized and (non-)deterministic NOF communication complexity. Specifically, their hard function can be solved by a randomized protocol sending $O(1)$ bits, but requires $\Omega(\log^{1/3}(N))$ bits of communication with a deterministic (or non-deterministic) protocol.
  We show a stronger $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(N))$ lower bound for their construction. To achieve this, the key technical advancement is an improvement to the sifting argument for grid norms of (somewhat dense) bipartite graphs. In addition to quantitative improvement, we qualitatively improve over [KLM'24] by relaxing the hardness condition: while [KLM'24] proved their lower bound for any function $f$ that satisfies a strong two-sided pseudorandom condition, we show that a weak one-sided condition suffices. This is achieved by a new structural result for cylinder intersections (or, in graph-theoretic language, the set of triangles induced from a tripartite graph), showing that any small cylinder intersection can be efficiently covered by a sum of simple ``slice'' functions.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, whose empirical distributions are known to approximate free additive and multiplicative convolutions, as the degree $d$ converges to infinity. In this paper, we study these approximations in finer detail, focusing on corrections (or fluctuations) up to order $1/d$, namely their infinitesimal distribution. By studying how the infinitesimal behavior of the moments relates to the infinitesimal behavior of the cumulants we are able to determine how the infinitesimal distributions changes under the additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions. It is worth mentioning that these operations do not correspond to the infinitesimal free additive and multiplicative convolutions that has been studied before, but in the additive case we provide an explicit connection using subordination functions. We give several examples and applications, including an explicit formula to compute the effect of repeated differentiation on the infinitesimal distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit formula for an operator that sends a wreath Macdonald polynomial to the delta function at a character associated to its partition. This allows us to prove many new results for wreath Macdonald polynomials, especially pertaining to reciprocity: Macdonald--Koornwinder duality, evaluation formulas, etc. Additionally, we initiate the study of wreath interpolation Macdonald polynomials, derive a plethystic formula for wreath $(q,t)$-Kostka coefficients, and present series solutions to the bispectral problem involving wreath Macdonald operators. Our approach is to use the eigenoperators for wreath Macdonald polynomials that have been produced from quantum toroidal and shuffle algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a free arrangement of $d$ lines in the complex projective plane, with exponents $d_1\leq d_2$. Let $m$ be the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal{A}$. In this note, we describe first the simple cases $d_1 \leq m$. Then we study the case $d_1=m+1$, and describe which line arrangements can occur by deleting or adding a line to $\mathcal{A}$. When $d \leq 14$, there are only two free arrangements with $d_1=m+2$, namely one with degree $13$ and the other with degree $14$. We study their geometries in order to deepen our understanding of the structure of free line arrangements in general.</description>

      <title>The inversion statistic in derangements and in other permutations with a prescribed number of fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the inversion statistic is influenced by fixed points in a permutation. %The expected number of inversions in a uniformly random permutation in $S_n$ is $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and each $k\in\{0,1,\cdots, n\}$, let $P_n^{(k)}$ denote the uniform probability measure on the set of permutations in $S_n$ with exactly $k$ fixed points. We obtain an exact formula for the expected number of inversions under the measure $P_n^{(k)}$ as well as for $P_n^{(k)}(\sigma^{-1}_i&lt;\sigma^{-1}_j)$, for $1\le i&lt;j\le n$, the $P_n^{(k)}$-probability that the number $i$ precedes the number $j$. In particular,
  up to a super-exponentially small correction as $n\to\infty$, the expected number of inversions in a random derangement $(k=0)$ is $\frac16n+\frac1{12}$ more than
  the value $\frac{n(n-1)}4$ that one obtains for a uniformly random
  general permutation in $S_n$. On the other hand, up to a super-exponentially small correction, for $k\ge2$, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with $k$ fixed points is $\frac{k-1}6n+\frac{k^2-k-1}{12}$ less than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. In the borderline case, $k=1$, up to a super-exponentially small correction, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with one fixed point is $\frac1{12}$ more than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. The proofs make strategic and perhaps novel use of the Chinese restaurant construction for a uniformly random permutation.</description>

      <title>Net Occurrences in Fibonacci and Thue-Morse Words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A net occurrence of a repeated string in a text is an occurrence with unique left and right extensions, and the net frequency of the string is the number of its net occurrences in the text. Originally introduced for applications in Natural Language Processing, net frequency has recently gained attention for its algorithmic aspects. Guo et al. [CPM 2024] and Ohlebusch et al. [SPIRE 2024] focus on its computation in the offline setting, while Guo et al. [SPIRE 2024], Inenaga [arXiv 2024], and Mieno and Inenaga [CPM 2025] tackle the online counterpart. Mieno and Inenaga also characterize net occurrences in terms of the minimal unique substrings of the text. Additionally, Guo et al. [CPM 2024] initiate the study of net occurrences in Fibonacci words to establish a lower bound on the asymptotic running time of algorithms. Although there has been notable progress in algorithmic developments and some initial combinatorial insights, the combinatorial aspects of net occurrences have yet to be thoroughly examined. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we confirm the conjecture that each Fibonacci word contains exactly three net occurrences. Second, we show that each Thue-Morse word contains exactly nine net occurrences. To achieve these results, we introduce the notion of overlapping net occurrence cover, which narrows down the candidate net occurrences in any text. Furthermore, we provide a precise characterization of occurrences of Fibonacci and Thue-Morse words of smaller order, offering structural insights that may have independent interest and potential applications in algorithm analysis and combinatorial properties of these words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of determinantal ideals whose decompositions encode the structural zeros in conditional independence models with hidden variables. We provide explicit decompositions of these ideals and, for certain subclasses of models, we show that this is a decomposition into radical ideals by displaying Gr\"obner bases for the components. We identify conditions under which the components are prime, and establish formulas for the dimensions of these prime ideals.
  Moreover, we show that the components in the decomposition can be grouped into equivalence classes defined by their combinatorial structure, and we derive a closed formula for the number of such classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a very general finite Ramsey theorem, where both the sets being colored and the homogeneous set must satisfy some largeness notion. For the homogeneous set this has already been done using the notion of $\alpha$-largeness, where $\alpha$ is a countable ordinal equipped with a system of fundamental sequences. To extend this approach the more appropriate notion is barrier largeness. Since the complexity of barriers can be measured by countable ordinals, we define Ramsey ordinals and, using appropriate iterations of the Veblen functions, we are able to compute them.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Expansion of Monotone Subsets of the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral gap of subgraphs of the hypercube induced by monotone subsets of vertices. For a monotone subset $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^{n}$ of density $\mu(A)$, the previous best lower bound on the spectral gap, due to Cohen, was $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)/n^{2}$, improving upon the earlier bound $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)^{2}/n^{2}$ established by Ding and Mossel. In this paper, we prove the optimal lower bound $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)/n$. As a corollary, we improve the mixing time upper bound of the random walk on constant-density monotone sets from $O(n^{3})$, as shown by Ding and Mossel, to $O(n^{2})$. Along the way, we develop two new inequalities that may be of independent interest: (1)~a directed $L^{2}$-Poincar\'{e} inequality on the hypercube, and (2)~an ``approximate'' FKG inequality for monotone sets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\frac1n\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}S_k^{(1)}(x)\in\mathbb Z[x(x+1)] \ \ \text{and}\ \ \frac{(6,n)}n\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}kS_k^{(1)}(x)\in\mathbb Z[x(x+1)]$$ for every positive integer $n$. We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/\pi$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,\pi}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,\pi}.$$</description>

      <title>A combinatorial proof of a symmetry for a refinement of the Narayana numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a tantalizing symmetry of certain numbers refining the Narayana numbers. In terms of Dyck paths, this symmetry is interpreted in the following way: if $w_{n,k,m}$ is the number of Dyck paths of semilength $n$ with $k$ occurrences of $UD$ and $m$ occurrences of $UUD$, then $w_{2k+1,k,m}=w_{2k+1,k,k+1-m}$. We give a combinatorial proof of this fact, relying on the cycle lemma, and showing that the numbers $w_{2k+1,k,m}$ are multiples of the Narayana numbers. We prove a more general fact establishing a relationship between the numbers $w_{n,k,m}$ and a family of generalized Narayana numbers due to Callan. A closed-form expression for the even more general numbers $w_{n,k_{1},k_{2},\ldots , k_{r}}$ counting the semilength-$n$ Dyck paths with $k_{1}$ $UD$-factors, $k_{2}$ $UUD$-factors, $\ldots$ , and $k_{r}$ $U^{r}D$-factors is also obtained, as well as a more general form of the discussed symmetry for these numbers in the case when all rise runs are of certain minimal length. Finally, we investigate properties of the polynomials $W_{n,k}(t)= \sum_{m=0}^k w_{n,k,m} t^m$, including real-rootedness, $\gamma$-positivity, and a symmetric decomposition.</description>

      <title>On Steinerberger Curvature and Graph Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steinerberger proposed a notion of curvature on graphs involving the graph distance matrix (J. Graph Theory, 2023). We show that nonnegative curvature is almost preserved under three graph operations. We characterize the distance matrix and its null space after adding an edge between two graphs. Let $D$ be the graph distance matrix and $\mathbf{1}$ be the all-one vector. We provide a way to construct graphs so that the linear system $Dx = \mathbf{1}$ does not have a solution.</description>

      <title>Counting subgraphs of coloring graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic polynomial $\pi_{G}(k)$ of a graph $G$ can be viewed as counting the number of vertices in a family of coloring graphs $\mathcal C_k(G)$ associated with (proper) $k$-colorings of $G$ as a function of the number of colors $k$. These coloring graphs can be understood as a reconfiguration system. We generalize the chromatic polynomial to $\pi_G^{(H)}(k)$, counting occurrences of arbitrary induced subgraphs $H$ in these coloring graphs, and we prove that these functions are polynomial in $k$. In particular, we study the chromatic pairs polynomial $\pi_{G}^{(P_2)}(k)$, which counts the number of edges in coloring graphs, corresponding to the number of pairs of colorings that differ on a single vertex. We show two trees share a chromatic pairs polynomial if and only if they have the same degree sequence, and we conjecture that the chromatic pairs polynomial refines the chromatic polynomial in general. We also instantiate our polynomials with other choices of $H$ to generate new graph invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15886v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.</description>

      <title>Avoiding short progressions in Euclidean Ramsey theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general framework to construct colorings avoiding short monochromatic arithmetic progressions in Euclidean Ramsey theory. Specifically, if $\ell_m$ denotes $m$ collinear points with consecutive points of distance one apart, we say that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_r,\ell_s)$ if there is a red/blue coloring of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space that avoids red congruent copies of $\ell_r$ and blue congruent copies of $\ell_s$. We show that $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{20})$, improving the best-known result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \ell_{1177})$ by F\"uhrer and T\'oth, and also establish $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_4, \ell_{14})$ and $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_5, \ell_{8})$ in the spirit of the classical result $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_6, \ell_{6})$ due to Erd\H{o}s et. al. We also show a number of similar $3$-coloring results, as well as $\mathbb{E}^n \not \to (\ell_3, \alpha\ell_{6889})$, where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary positive real number. This final result answers a question of F\"uhrer and T\'oth in the positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a procedure to asymptotically enumerate monotone grid classes of permutations. This is then applied to compute the asymptotic number of permutations in any connected one-corner class. Our strategy consists of enumerating the gridded permutations, finding the asymptotic distribution of points between the cells in a typical large gridded permutation, and analysing in detail the ways in which a typical permutation can be gridded. We also determine the limit shape of any connected monotone grid class.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be Ramsey size-linear if $r(G,H) =O_G (e(H))$ for every graph $H$ with no isolated vertices. Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp observed that $K_4$ is not Ramsey size-linear, but each of its proper subgraphs is, and they asked whether there exist infinitely many such graphs. In this short note, we answer this question in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>$1$-planar graphs without induced claws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete bipartite graph $K_{1,3}$ is called a claw. The properties of claw-free graphs have attracted considerable attention, with research on claw-free planar graphs tracing back to Plummer's work in 1989. In this paper, we extend this line of research by establishing some fundamental results for claw-free 1-planar graphs, focusing on upper bounds for maximum degree and vertex-connectivity. We show that the maximum degree of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 10, and the bound is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for 6-connected 1-planar graphs and optimal 1-planar graphs under the constraint of forbidding induced claws, the maximum degree has the better upper bound 8. Finally, we show that every 7-connected 1-planar graph contains an induced claw, thereby implying that the vertex-connectivity of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 6. For a better comparison, we also refine some known results by Plummer on claw-free planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Vertex models for the product of a permuted-basement Demazure atom and a Schur polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first positive combinatorial rule for expanding the product of a permuted-basement Demazure atom and a Schur polynomial. Special cases of permuted-basement Demazure atoms include Demazure atoms and characters. These cases have known tableau formulas for their expansions when multiplied by a Schur polynomial, due to Haglund, Luoto, Mason and van Willigenburg. We find a vertex model formula, giving a new rule even in these special cases, extending a technique introduced by Zinn-Justin for calculating Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
  We derive a coloured vertex model for permuted-basement Demazure atoms, inspired by Borodin and Wheeler's model for non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. We make this model compatible with an uncoloured vertex model for Schur polynomials, putting them in a single framework. Unlike previous work on structure coefficients via vertex models, a remarkable feature of our construction is that it relies on a Yang-Baxter equation that only holds for certain boundary conditions. However, this restricted Yang-Baxter equation is sufficient to show our result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, the order polytope of the zigzag poset has been thoroughly studied. A related poset, called \emph{crown poset}, obtained by adding an extra relation between the endpoints of an even zigzag poset, is not so well understood. In this paper, we study the order polytopes of crown posets. We provide explicit formulas for their $f$-vectors. We provide recursive formulas for their Ehrhart polynomial, giving a counterpart to formulas found in the zigzag case by Petersen--Zhuang (2025). We use these formulas to simplify a computation by Ferroni--Morales--Panova (2025) of the linear term of the order polynomial of these posets. Furthermore, we provide a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients of the $h^*$-polynomial in terms of the cyclic swap statistic on cyclically alternating permutations, which provides a circular version of a result by Coons--Sullivant (2023).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of probability measures in terms of moments by applying operators to their Bessel generating functions. We consider a general setting of applying operators such as the Dunkl operator to formal power series that are symmetric or symmetric in all but one variable. Afterwards, we apply the results from this setting by considering Bessel generating functions as the formal power series to obtain a Law of Large Numbers as $N$, the number of variables, increases to infinity and $N^c\beta$ converges to a constant, where $c\in (-\infty, 1)$. In contrast with previous results, we consider when the scaled partial derivatives of the logarithms of the Bessel generating functions evaluated at the origin can have nonzero $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit when any number of variables is involved. Then, the free cumulant of order $k$ is a linear combination of the limits of the order $k$ partial derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Newton polytopes of $F$-polynomials in a TSSS cluster algebra $\mathcal A$ and generalize them to a larger set consisting of polytopes $N_{h}$ associated to vectors $h\in\Z^{n}$ as well as $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ consisting of polytope functions $\rho_{h}$ corresponding to $N_{h}$.
  The main contribution contains that
  (i) obtaining a {\em recurrence construction} of the Laurent expression of a cluster variable in a cluster from its $g$-vector;
  (ii) proving the subset $\mathcal{P}$ of $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ consisting of Laurent polynomials in $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ is a strongly positive $\Z Trop(Y)$-basis for $\mathcal{U}(\A)$ consisting of certain universally indecomposable Laurent polynomials when $\A$ is a cluster algebra with principal coefficients. For a cluster algebra $\mathcal A$ over arbitrary semifield $\mathbb P$ in general, $\mathcal{P}$ is a strongly positive $\Z\P$-basis for the intermediate cluster subalgebra $\mathcal{I_P(A)}$ of $\mathcal{U(A)}$. We call $\mathcal P$ the {\em polytope basis};
  (iii) constructing some explicit maps among corresponding $F$-polynomials, $g$-vectors, $d$-vectors and cluster variables to characterize their relationship.
  Moreover, we give three applications of (i), (ii) and (iii) respectively.</description>

      <title>Macaulay Posets and Rings</title>

Abstract: Macaulay posets are posets in which an analog of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem holds. Macaulay rings (also called Macaulay-Lex rings) are rings in which an analog of Macaulay's Theorem for lex ideals holds. The study of both of these objects started with Macaulay almost a century ago. Since then, these two branches have developed separately over the past century, with the last link being the Clements-Lindstr\"om Theorem.
  For every ring that is the quotient of a polynomial ring by a homogeneous ideal we define the poset of monomials. Under certain conditions, we prove a Macaulay Correspondence Theorem, a ring is Macaulay if and only if its poset of monomials is Macaulay. Furthermore, the tensor product of rings corresponds to the Cartesian product of the posets of monomials. This allows us to transfer results between rings and posets. By using this translation, we give several answers to a problem posed by Mermin and Peeva, a positive answer to Hoefel's question about applying Macaulay poset theory to ring theory, and deduce several other results in algebra and combinatorics.
  A new proof of the Mermin-Murai Theorem on colored square free rings is presented by using star posets. We extend the Mermin-Murai Theorem to rings that are not square free. Using a result from Mermin and Peeva we give an answer to a question posed by Bezrukov and Leck. Some results of Chong also give answers to the Bezrukov-Leck problem. All of these results have a common feature. They involve the tensor product of rings whose Hasse graphs of the poset of monomials are trees. We call such rings, tree rings. We give a classification of Macaulay rings that are the tensor product of a tree ring. Finally, we show that there are Macaulay rings that are not the tensor product of tree rings, and present the first examples of Macaulay rings that are not quotients by a monomial ideal and not quotients by a toric ideal.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Softassign via Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softassign is a pivotal method in graph matching and other learning tasks. Many softassign-based algorithms exhibit performance sensitivity to a parameter in the softassign. However, tuning the parameter is challenging and almost done empirically. This paper proposes an adaptive softassign method for graph matching by analyzing the relationship between the objective score and the parameter. This method can automatically tune the parameter based on a given error bound to guarantee accuracy. The Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn formulas introduced in this study significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of the adaptive softassign. Moreover, these formulas can also be used in optimal transport problems. The resulting adaptive softassign graph matching algorithm enjoys significantly higher accuracy than previous state-of-the-art large graph matching algorithms while maintaining comparable efficiency.</description>

      <title>On a Hierarchy of Spectral Invariants for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of graph invariants that naturally extends the spectral invariants defined by F\"urer (Lin. Alg. Appl. 2010) based on the angles formed by the set of standard basis vectors and their projections onto eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of this hierarchy in terms of the walk counts. This allows us to give a complete answer to F\"urer's question about the strength of his invariants in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs in comparison to the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, extending the recent work of Rattan and Seppelt (SODA 2023). As another application of the characterization, we prove that almost all graphs are determined up to isomorphism in terms of the spectrum and the angles, which is of interest in view of the long-standing open problem whether almost all graphs are determined by their eigenvalues alone. Finally, we describe the exact relationship between the hierarchy and the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms for small dimensions, as also some other important spectral characteristics of a graph such as the generalized and the main spectra.</description>

      <title>On partitions with bounded largest part and fixed integral GBG-rank modulo primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15117v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Berkovich and Garvan introduced a new partition statistic called the GBG-rank modulo $t$ which is a generalization of the well-known BG-rank. In this paper, we use the Littlewood decomposition of partitions to study partitions with bounded largest part and fixed integral value of GBG-rank modulo primes. As a consequence, we obtain new elegant generating function formulas for unrestricted partitions, self-conjugate partitions, and partitions whose parts repeat a finite number of times.</description>

      <title>On Conjecture of Binomial Edge Ideals of Linear Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of linear type when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the following result and its discrete equivalent: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. Additionally, we show that the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of this result.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, and Lie monoid actions in Morse and Floer theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Seshadri stratifications on normal toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the theory of Seshadri stratifications to embedded toric varieties $X_P\subseteq \mathbb P(V)$ associated with a normal lattice polytope $P$. The approach presented here is purely combinatorial and completely independent of \cite{CFL}. In particular, we get a close connection between a certain class of triangulations of the polytope $P$, Seshadri stratifications of $X_P$ arising from torus orbit closures, and the associated degenerate semi-toric varieties. In the last section we show that the approach here and the one in \cite{CFL} produce the same quasi-valuations and hence the same degenerations of $X_P$.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: Gorenstein toric rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I \subset S$ a monomial ideal. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$, the ideal $I_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal generated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)$ be the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq 0$. For a finite graph $G$, its edge ideal is denoted by $I(G)$. Let $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ be the toric ring which is generated by the monomials belonging to the minimal system of monomial generators of $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$. In a previous work, the authors proved that $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal. It follows that $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ is a normal Cohen--Macaulay domain. In this paper, we study the Gorenstein property of $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$.</description>
