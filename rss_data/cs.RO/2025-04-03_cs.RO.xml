      <title>HomeEmergency -- Using Audio to Find and Respond to Emergencies in the Home</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the United States alone accidental home deaths exceed 128,000 per year. Our work aims to enable home robots who respond to emergency scenarios in the home, preventing injuries and deaths. We introduce a new dataset of household emergencies based in the ThreeDWorld simulator. Each scenario in our dataset begins with an instantaneous or periodic sound which may or may not be an emergency. The agent must navigate the multi-room home scene using prior observations, alongside audio signals and images from the simulator, to determine if there is an emergency or not.
  In addition to our new dataset, we present a modular approach for localizing and identifying potential home emergencies. Underpinning our approach is a novel probabilistic dynamic scene graph (P-DSG), where our key insight is that graph nodes corresponding to agents can be represented with a probabilistic edge. This edge, when refined using Bayesian inference, enables efficient and effective localization of agents in the scene. We also utilize multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) as a component in our approach, determining object traits (e.g. flammability) and identifying emergencies. We present a demonstration of our method completing a real-world version of our task on a consumer robot, showing the transferability of both our task and our method. Our dataset will be released to the public upon this papers publication.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Robots in Public Spaces: A Study of Trash Barrel Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze video data and interviews from a public deployment of two trash barrel robots in a large public space to better understand the sensemaking activities people perform when they encounter robots in public spaces. Based on an analysis of 274 human-robot interactions and interviews with N=65 individuals or groups, we discovered that people were responding not only to the robots or their behavior, but also to the general idea of deploying robots as trashcans, and the larger social implications of that idea. They wanted to understand details about the deployment because having that knowledge would change how they interact with the robot. Based on our data and analysis, we have provided implications for design that may be topics for future human-robot design researchers who are exploring robots for public space deployment. Furthermore, our work offers a practical example of analyzing field data to make sense of robots in public spaces.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Design: Modeling Force Output for Axisymmetric Soft Pneumatic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) made from elastomeric materials can provide large strain and large force. The behavior of locally strain-restricted hyperelastic materials under inflation has been investigated thoroughly for shape reconfiguration, but requires further investigation for trajectories involving external force. In this work we model force-pressure-height relationships for a concentrically strain-limited class of soft pneumatic actuators and demonstrate the use of this model to design SPA response for object lifting. We predict relationships under different loadings by solving energy minimization equations and verify this theory by using an automated test rig to collect rich data for n=22 Ecoflex 00-30 membranes. We collect this data using an active learning pipeline to efficiently model the design space. We show that this learned material model outperforms the theory-based model and naive curve-fitting approaches. We use our model to optimize membrane design for different lift tasks and compare this performance to other designs. These contributions represent a step towards understanding the natural response for this class of actuator and embodying intelligent lifts in a single-pressure input actuator system.</description>

      <title>Extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics for Bipedal Walking of the Knee-less Robot SLIDER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee-less bipedal robots like SLIDER have the advantage of ultra-lightweight legs and improved walking energy efficiency compared to traditional humanoid robots. In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the bipedal robot SLIDER with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution which enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</description>

      <title>Value Iteration for Learning Concurrently Executable Robotic Control Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems such as multi-robot systems and manipulators exhibit redundancy, a property owing to which they are capable of executing multiple tasks. This work proposes a novel method, based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, to train redundant robots to be able to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Our approach differs from typical multi-objective RL methods insofar as the learned tasks can be combined and executed in possibly time-varying prioritized stacks. We do so by first defining a notion of task independence between learned value functions. We then use our definition of task independence to propose a cost functional that encourages a policy, based on an approximated value function, to accomplish its control objective while minimally interfering with the execution of higher priority tasks. This allows us to train a set of control policies that can be executed simultaneously. We also introduce a version of fitted value iteration to learn to approximate our proposed cost functional efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on several scenarios and robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Plan-and-Act using Large Language Models for Interactive Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are capable of planning robot actions. In this paper, we explore how LLMs can be used for planning actions with tasks involving situational human-robot interaction (HRI). A key problem of applying LLMs in situational HRI is balancing between "respecting the current human's activity" and "prioritizing the robot's task," as well as understanding the timing of when to use the LLM to generate an action plan. In this paper, we propose a necessary plan-and-act skill design to solve the above problems. We show that a critical factor for enabling a robot to switch between passive / active interaction behavior is to provide the LLM with an action text about the current robot's action. We also show that a second-stage question to the LLM (about the next timing to call the LLM) is necessary for planning actions at an appropriate timing. The skill design is applied to an Engage skill and is tested on four distinct interaction scenarios. We show that by using the skill design, LLMs can be leveraged to easily scale to different HRI scenarios with a reasonable success rate reaching 90% on the test scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>ForestVO: Enhancing Visual Odometry in Forest Environments through ForestGlue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in visual odometry systems have improved autonomous navigation; however, challenges persist in complex environments like forests, where dense foliage, variable lighting, and repetitive textures compromise feature correspondence accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</description>

      <title>AIM: Acoustic Inertial Measurement for Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Bi-LAT: Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Natural Language and Action Chunking with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Bi-LAT, a novel imitation learning framework that unifies bilateral control with natural language processing to achieve precise force modulation in robotic manipulation. Bi-LAT leverages joint position, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower teleoperation while also integrating visual and linguistic cues to dynamically adjust applied force. By encoding human instructions such as "softly grasp the cup" or "strongly twist the sponge" through a multimodal Transformer-based model, Bi-LAT learns to distinguish nuanced force requirements in real-world tasks. We demonstrate Bi-LAT's performance in (1) unimanual cup-stacking scenario where the robot accurately modulates grasp force based on language commands, and (2) bimanual sponge-twisting task that requires coordinated force control. Experimental results show that Bi-LAT effectively reproduces the instructed force levels, particularly when incorporating SigLIP among tested language encoders. Our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating natural language cues into imitation learning, paving the way for more intuitive and adaptive human-robot interaction.

      <title>Inverse RL Scene Dynamics Learning for Nonlinear Predictive Control in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Deep Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller with Scene Dynamics (DL-NMPC-SD) method for autonomous navigation. DL-NMPC-SD uses an a-priori nominal vehicle model in combination with a scene dynamics model learned from temporal range sensing information. The scene dynamics model is responsible for estimating the desired vehicle trajectory, as well as to adjust the true system model used by the underlying model predictive controller. We propose to encode the scene dynamics model within the layers of a deep neural network, which acts as a nonlinear approximator for the high order state-space of the operating conditions. The model is learned based on temporal sequences of range sensing observations and system states, both integrated by an Augmented Memory component. We use Inverse Reinforcement Learning and the Bellman optimality principle to train our learning controller with a modified version of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, enabling us to estimate the desired state trajectory as an optimal action-value function. We have evaluated DL-NMPC-SD against the baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against two state-of-the-art End2End and reinforcement learning methods, respectively. The performance has been measured in three experiments: i) in our GridSim virtual environment, ii) on indoor and outdoor navigation tasks using our RovisLab AMTU (Autonomous Mobile Test Unit) platform and iii) on a full scale autonomous test vehicle driving on public roads.</description>

      <title>Intuitive Human-Drone Collaborative Navigation in Unknown Environments through Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the widespread integration of aerial robots in inspection, search and rescue, and monitoring tasks, there is a growing demand to design intuitive human-drone interfaces. These aim to streamline and enhance the user interaction and collaboration process during drone navigation, ultimately expediting mission success and accommodating users' inputs. In this paper, we present a novel human-drone mixed reality interface that aims to (a) increase human-drone spatial awareness by sharing relevant spatial information and representations between the human equipped with a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and the robot and (b) enable safer and intuitive human-drone interactive and collaborative navigation in unknown environments beyond the simple command and control or teleoperation paradigm. We validate our framework through extensive user studies and experiments in a simulated post-disaster scenarios, comparing its performance against a traditional First-Person View (FPV) control systems. Furthermore, multiple tests on several users underscore the advantages of the proposed solution, which offers intuitive and natural interaction with the system. This demonstrates the solution's ability to assist humans during a drone navigation mission, ensuring its safe and effective execution.</description>

      <title>Teaching Robots to Handle Nuclear Waste: A Teleoperation-Based Learning Approach&lt;</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Learning from Teleoperation (LfT) framework that integrates human expertise with robotic precision to enable robots to autonomously perform skills learned from human operators. The proposed framework addresses challenges in nuclear waste handling tasks, which often involve repetitive and meticulous manipulation operations. By capturing operator movements and manipulation forces during teleoperation, the framework utilizes this data to train machine learning models capable of replicating and generalizing human skills. We validate the effectiveness of the LfT framework through its application to a power plug insertion task, selected as a representative scenario that is repetitive yet requires precise trajectory and force control. Experimental results highlight significant improvements in task efficiency, while reducing reliance on continuous operator involvement.</description>

      <title>From Shadows to Safety: Occlusion Tracking and Risk Mitigation for Urban Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must navigate dynamic urban environments where occlusions and perception limitations introduce significant uncertainties. This research builds upon and extends existing approaches in risk-aware motion planning and occlusion tracking to address these challenges. While prior studies have developed individual methods for occlusion tracking and risk assessment, a comprehensive method integrating these techniques has not been fully explored. We, therefore, enhance a phantom agent-centric model by incorporating sequential reasoning to track occluded areas and predict potential hazards. Our model enables realistic scenario representation and context-aware risk evaluation by modeling diverse phantom agents, each with distinct behavior profiles. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach improves situational awareness and balances proactive safety with efficient traffic flow. While these results underline the potential of our method, validation in real-world scenarios is necessary to confirm its feasibility and generalizability. By utilizing and advancing established methodologies, this work contributes to safer and more reliable AV planning in complex urban environments. To support further research, our method is available as open-source software at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/OcclusionAwareMotionPlanning</description>

      <title>Pedestrian-Aware Motion Planning for Autonomous Driving in Complex Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning in uncertain environments like complex urban areas is a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The aim of our research is to investigate how AVs can navigate crowded, unpredictable scenarios with multiple pedestrians while maintaining a safe and efficient vehicle behavior. So far, most research has concentrated on static or deterministic traffic participant behavior. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in crowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic pedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner. We evaluate this new algorithm in a 2D simulation environment to rigorously assess AV-pedestrian interactions, demonstrating that our algorithm enables safe, efficient, and adaptive motion planning, particularly in highly crowded urban environments - a first in achieving this level of performance. This study has not taken into consideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so far. Further studies are needed to investigate the novel algorithm in a complete software stack for AVs on real cars to investigate the entire perception, planning and control pipeline in crowded scenarios. We release the code developed in this research as an open-source resource for further studies and development.

      <title>DF-Calib: Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration via Depth Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for integrating these two sensors into robotic systems to achieve robust perception. In applications like autonomous driving, online targetless calibration enables a prompt sensor misalignment correction from mechanical vibrations without extra targets. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively extracting consistent features from LiDAR and camera data and fail to prioritize salient regions, compromising cross-modal alignment robustness. To address these issues, we propose DF-Calib, a LiDAR-camera calibration method that reformulates calibration as an intra-modality depth flow estimation problem. DF-Calib estimates a dense depth map from the camera image and completes the sparse LiDAR projected depth map, using a shared feature encoder to extract consistent depth-to-depth features, effectively bridging the 2D-3D cross-modal gap. Additionally, we introduce a reliability map to prioritize valid pixels and propose a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to enhance depth flow estimation. Experimental results across multiple datasets validate its accuracy and generalization,with DF-Calib achieving a mean translation error of 0.635cm and rotation error of 0.045 degrees on the KITTI dataset.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity direction, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead to failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization is required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of rescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting LiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization methods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective when the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a robust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems (D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU measurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of the LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated within the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion in the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the iterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry. The proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or stationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments demonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various platforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes dynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the research community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Grasping by Spiraling: Reproducing Elephant Movements with Rigid-Soft Robot Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logarithmic spiral is observed as a common pattern in several living beings across kingdoms and species. Some examples include fern shoots, prehensile tails, and soft limbs like octopus arms and elephant trunks. In the latter cases, spiraling is also used for grasping. Motivated by how this strategy simplifies behavior into kinematic primitives and combines them to develop smart grasping movements, this work focuses on the elephant trunk, which is more deeply investigated in the literature. We present a soft arm combined with a rigid robotic system to replicate elephant grasping capabilities based on the combination of a soft trunk with a solid body. In our system, the rigid arm ensures positioning and orientation, mimicking the role of the elephant's head, while the soft manipulator reproduces trunk motion primitives of bending and twisting under proper actuation patterns. This synergy replicates 9 distinct elephant grasping strategies reported in the literature, accommodating objects of varying shapes and sizes. The synergistic interaction between the rigid and soft components of the system minimizes the control complexity while maintaining a high degree of adaptability.</description>

      <title>8-DoFs Cable Driven Parallel Robots for Bimanual Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation plays a critical role in intuitive robot control and imitation learning, particularly for complex tasks involving mobile manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom (DoFs). However, most existing master controllers are limited to 6-DoF spatial control and basic gripper control, making them insufficient for controlling high-DoF robots and restricting the operator to a small workspace. In this work, we present a novel, low-cost, high-DoF master controller based on Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), designed to overcome these limitations. The system decouples translation and orientation control, following a scalable 3 + 3 + n DoF structure: 3 DoFs for large-range translation using a CDPR, 3 DoFs for orientation using a gimbal mechanism, and n additional DoFs for gripper and redundant joint control. Its lightweight cable-driven design enables a large and adaptable workspace while minimizing actuator load. The end-effector remains stable without requiring continuous high-torque input, unlike most serial robot arms. We developed the first dual-arm CDPR-based master controller using cost-effective actuators and a simple mechanical structure. In demonstrations, the system successfully controlled an 8-DoF robotic arm with a 2-DoF pan-tilt camera, performing tasks such as pick-and-place, knot tying, object sorting, and tape application. The results show precise, versatile, and practical high-DoF teleoperation.</description>

      <title>LL-Localizer: A Life-Long Localization System based on Dynamic i-Octree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an incremental voxel-based life-long localization method, LL-Localizer, which enables robots to localize robustly and accurately in multi-session mode using prior maps. Meanwhile, considering that it is difficult to be aware of changes in the environment in the prior map and robots may traverse between mapped and unmapped areas during actual operation, we will update the map when needed according to the established strategies through incremental voxel map. Besides, to ensure high performance in real-time and facilitate our map management, we utilize Dynamic i-Octree, an efficient organization of 3D points based on Dynamic Octree to load local map and update the map during the robot's operation. The experiments show that our system can perform stable and accurate localization comparable to state-of-the-art LIO systems. And even if the environment in the prior map changes or the robots traverse between mapped and unmapped areas, our system can still maintain robust and accurate localization without any distinction. Our demo can be found on Blibili (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1faZHYCEkZ) and youtube (https://youtu.be/UWn7RCb9kA8) and the program will be available at https://github.com/M-Evanovic/LL-Localizer.</description>

      <title>Building Knowledge from Interactions: An LLM-Based Architecture for Adaptive Tutoring and Social Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating robotics into everyday scenarios like tutoring or physical training requires robots capable of adaptive, socially engaging, and goal-oriented interactions. While Large Language Models show promise in human-like communication, their standalone use is hindered by memory constraints and contextual incoherence. This work presents a multimodal, cognitively inspired framework that enhances LLM-based autonomous decision-making in social and task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based agent for a robot trainer, balancing social conversation with task guidance and goal-driven motivation. To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions. A preliminary HRI user study and offline experiments with a synthetic dataset validate our approach, demonstrating the system's ability to manage complex interactions, autonomously drive training tasks, and build and retrieve contextual memories, advancing socially intelligent robotics.</description>

      <title>Anticipating Degradation: A Predictive Approach to Fault Tolerance in Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An active approach to fault tolerance is essential for robot swarms to achieve long-term autonomy. Previous efforts have focused on responding to spontaneous electro-mechanical faults and failures. However, many faults occur gradually over time. Waiting until such faults have manifested as failures before addressing them is both inefficient and unsustainable in a variety of scenarios. This work argues that the principles of predictive maintenance, in which potential faults are resolved before they hinder the operation of the swarm, offer a promising means of achieving long-term fault tolerance. This is a novel approach to swarm fault tolerance, which is shown to give a comparable or improved performance when tested against a reactive approach in almost all cases tested.</description>

      <title>TransforMerger: Transformer-based Voice-Gesture Fusion for Robust Human-Robot Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As human-robot collaboration advances, natural and flexible communication methods are essential for effective robot control. Traditional methods relying on a single modality or rigid rules struggle with noisy or misaligned data as well as with object descriptions that do not perfectly fit the predefined object names (e.g. 'Pick that red object'). We introduce TransforMerger, a transformer-based reasoning model that infers a structured action command for robotic manipulation based on fused voice and gesture inputs. Our approach merges multimodal data into a single unified sentence, which is then processed by the language model. We employ probabilistic embeddings to handle uncertainty and we integrate contextual scene understanding to resolve ambiguous references (e.g., gestures pointing to multiple objects or vague verbal cues like "this"). We evaluate TransforMerger in simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating its robustness to noise, misalignment, and missing information. Our results show that TransforMerger outperforms deterministic baselines, especially in scenarios requiring more contextual knowledge, enabling more robust and flexible human-robot communication. Code and datasets are available at: http://imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/transformerger.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a dataset gathered with an underwater robot in a sea-based aquaculture setting. Data was gathered from an operational fish farm and includes data from sensors such as the Waterlinked A50 DVL, the Nortek Nucleus 1000 DVL, Sonardyne Micro Ranger 2 USBL, Sonoptix Mulitbeam Sonar, mono and stereo cameras, and vehicle sensor data such as power usage, IMU, pressure, temperature, and more. Data acquisition is performed during both manual and autonomous traversal of the net pen structure. The collected vision data is of undamaged nets with some fish and marine growth presence, and it is expected that both the research community and the aquaculture industry will benefit greatly from the utilization of the proposed SOLAQUA dataset.</description>

      <title>Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Corner-Grasp: Multi-Action Grasp Detection and Active Gripper Adaptation for Grasping in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is an essential capability, playing a critical role in enabling robots to physically interact with their surroundings. Despite extensive research, challenges remain due to the diverse shapes and properties of target objects, inaccuracies in sensing, and potential collisions with the environment. In this work, we propose a method for effectively grasping in cluttered bin-picking environments where these challenges intersect. We utilize a multi-functional gripper that combines both suction and finger grasping to handle a wide range of objects. We also present an active gripper adaptation strategy to minimize collisions between the gripper hardware and the surrounding environment by actively leveraging the reciprocating suction cup and reconfigurable finger motion. To fully utilize the gripper's capabilities, we built a neural network that detects suction and finger grasp points from a single input RGB-D image. This network is trained using a larger-scale synthetic dataset generated from simulation. In addition to this, we propose an efficient approach to constructing a real-world dataset that facilitates grasp point detection on various objects with diverse characteristics. Experiment results show that the proposed method can grasp objects in cluttered bin-picking scenarios and prevent collisions with environmental constraints such as a corner of the bin. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness in the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024.</description>

      <title>A novel gesture interaction control method for rehabilitation lower extremity exoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic Exoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI methods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based HRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI methods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity, sensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and, most importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the interaction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient motivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB monocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps: detecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby applying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to control gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a feasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high latency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a gesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\% and an average system response time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed non-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control interactions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development in this field.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Multi-Robot Systems for SAR: Co-Designing Robotics and Communication Towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents field-tested use cases from Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, highlighting the co-design of mobile robots and communication systems to support Edge-Cloud architectures based on 5G Standalone (SA). The main goal is to contribute to the effective cooperation of multiple robots and first responders. Our field experience includes the development of Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (H-WSNs) for risk and victim detection, smartphones integrated into the Robot Operating System (ROS) as Edge devices for mission requests and path planning, real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) via Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), and implementation of Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs) for victim evacuation in different navigation modes. These experiments, conducted in collaboration with actual first responders, underscore the need for intelligent network resource management, balancing low-latency and high-bandwidth demands. Network slicing is key to ensuring critical emergency services are performed despite challenging communication conditions. The paper identifies architectural needs, lessons learned, and challenges to be addressed by 6G technologies to enhance emergency response capabilities.</description>

Abstract: The majority of modern robot learning methods focus on learning a set of pre-defined tasks with limited or no generalization to new tasks. Extending the robot skillset to novel tasks involves gathering an extensive amount of training data for additional tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching new tasks to robots using human demonstration videos for repetitive tasks (e.g., packing). This task requires understanding the human video to identify which object is being manipulated (the pick object) and where it is being placed (the placement slot). In addition, it needs to re-identify the pick object and the placement slots during inference along with the relative poses to enable robot execution of the task. To tackle this, we propose SLeRP, a modular system that leverages several advanced visual foundation models and a novel slot-level placement detector Slot-Net, eliminating the need for expensive video demonstrations for training. We evaluate our system using a new benchmark of real-world videos. The evaluation results show that SLeRP outperforms several baselines and can be deployed on a real robot.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Depth-Aided Occupancy Prediction based on Cylindrical Voxel for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D perception is essential for autonomous driving. Traditional methods often struggle with geometric ambiguity due to a lack of geometric prior. To address these challenges, we use omnidirectional depth estimation to introduce geometric prior. Based on the depth information, we propose a Sketch-Coloring framework OmniDepth-Occ. Additionally, our approach introduces a cylindrical voxel representation based on polar coordinate to better align with the radial nature of panoramic camera views. To address the lack of fisheye camera dataset in autonomous driving tasks, we also build a virtual scene dataset with six fisheye cameras, and the data volume has reached twice that of SemanticKITTI. Experimental results demonstrate that our Sketch-Coloring network significantly enhances 3D perception performance.</description>

      <title>Gaze-Guided 3D Hand Motion Prediction for Detecting Intent in Egocentric Grasping Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human intention detection with hand motion prediction is critical to drive the upper-extremity assistive robots in neurorehabilitation applications. However, the traditional methods relying on physiological signal measurement are restrictive and often lack environmental context. We propose a novel approach that predicts future sequences of both hand poses and joint positions. This method integrates gaze information, historical hand motion sequences, and environmental object data, adapting dynamically to the assistive needs of the patient without prior knowledge of the intended object for grasping. Specifically, we use a vector-quantized variational autoencoder for robust hand pose encoding with an autoregressive generative transformer for effective hand motion sequence prediction. We demonstrate the usability of these novel techniques in a pilot study with healthy subjects. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we collect a dataset consisting of various types of grasp actions on different objects from multiple subjects. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully predict sequential hand movement. Especially, the gaze information shows significant enhancements in prediction capabilities, particularly with fewer input frames, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Cal or No Cal? -- Real-Time Miscalibration Detection of LiDAR and Camera Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of extrinsic calibration is the alignment of sensor data to ensure an accurate representation of the surroundings and enable sensor fusion applications. From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/MiscalibrationDetection.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Multi-Pipette Localisation in Robot-Assisted In Vivo Patch-Clamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo image-guided multi-pipette patch-clamp is essential for studying cellular interactions and network dynamics in neuroscience. However, current procedures mainly rely on manual expertise, which limits accessibility and scalability. Robotic automation presents a promising solution, but achieving precise real-time detection of multiple pipettes remains a challenge. Existing methods focus on ex vivo experiments or single pipette use, making them inadequate for in vivo multi-pipette scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a heatmap-augmented coarse-to-fine learning technique to facilitate multi-pipette real-time localisation for robot-assisted in vivo patch-clamp. More specifically, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based module to remove background noise and enhance pipette visibility. We then introduce a two-stage Transformer model that starts with predicting the coarse heatmap of the pipette tips, followed by the fine-grained coordination regression module for precise tip localisation. To ensure robust training, we use the Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching between the predicted and actual locations of tips. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieved &gt; 98% accuracy within 10 {\mu}m, and &gt; 89% accuracy within 5 {\mu}m for the localisation of multi-pipette tips. The average MSE is 2.52 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>FUSION: Frequency-guided Underwater Spatial Image recOnstructioN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Cuddle-Fish: Exploring a Soft Floating Robot with Flapping Wings for Physical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying robots, such as quadrotor drones, offer new possibilities for human-robot interaction but often pose safety risks due to fast-spinning propellers, rigid structures, and noise. In contrast, lighter-than-air flapping-wing robots, inspired by animal movement, offer a soft, quiet, and touch-safe alternative. Building on these advantages, we present \textit{Cuddle-Fish}, a soft, flapping-wing floating robot designed for safe, close-proximity interactions in indoor spaces. Through a user study with 24 participants, we explored their perceptions of the robot and experiences during a series of co-located demonstrations in which the robot moved near them. Results showed that participants felt safe, willingly engaged in touch-based interactions with the robot, and exhibited spontaneous affective behaviours, such as patting, stroking, hugging, and cheek-touching, without external prompting. They also reported positive emotional responses towards the robot. These findings suggest that the soft floating robot with flapping wings can serve as a novel and socially acceptable alternative to traditional rigid flying robots, opening new possibilities for companionship, play, and interactive experiences in everyday indoor environments.</description>

Abstract: Planning methods with high adaptability to dynamic environments are crucial for the development of autonomous and versatile robots. We propose a method for leveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks capable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects environmental "status," representing conditions and goals, and uses them to generate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific conditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We conducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically generated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming the comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher generality. This research marks a significant advancement toward the development of versatile planning methods applicable to robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart systems, and other complex environments.</description>

      <title>Proposition of Affordance-Driven Environment Recognition Framework Using Symbol Networks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.</description>

      <title>Overlap-Aware Feature Learning for Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) is a cornerstone for environmental perception in robotic systems and autonomous driving, enabling precise scene understanding through point-wise classification. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Reasoning LLMs for User-Aware Multimodal Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalization in social robotics is critical for fostering effective human-robot interactions, yet systems often face the cold start problem, where initial user preferences or characteristics are unavailable. This paper proposes a novel framework called USER-LLM R1 for a user-aware conversational agent that addresses this challenge through dynamic user profiling and model initiation. Our approach integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning models to iteratively infer user preferences and vision-language models (VLMs) to initialize user profiles from multimodal inputs, enabling personalized interactions from the first encounter. Leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system dynamically refines user representations within an inherent CoT process, ensuring contextually relevant and adaptive responses. Evaluations on the ElderlyTech-VQA Bench demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE-1 (+23.2%), ROUGE-2 (+0.6%), and ROUGE-L (+8%) F1 scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation studies underscoring the impact of reasoning model size on performance. Human evaluations further validate the framework's efficacy, particularly for elderly users, where tailored responses enhance engagement and trust. Ethical considerations, including privacy preservation and bias mitigation, are rigorously discussed and addressed to ensure responsible deployment.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Expert Demonstrations: Outcome-Driven Action Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01719v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of offline reinforcement learning using realistic data, specifically non-expert data collected through sub-optimal behavior policies. Under such circumstance, the learned policy must be safe enough to manage distribution shift while maintaining sufficient flexibility to deal with non-expert (bad) demonstrations from offline data.To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel method called Outcome-Driven Action Flexibility (ODAF), which seeks to reduce reliance on the empirical action distribution of the behavior policy, hence reducing the negative impact of those bad demonstrations.To be specific, a new conservative reward mechanism is developed to deal with distribution shift by evaluating actions according to whether their outcomes meet safety requirements - remaining within the state support area, rather than solely depending on the actions' likelihood based on offline data.Besides theoretical justification, we provide empirical evidence on widely used MuJoCo and various maze benchmarks, demonstrating that our ODAF method, implemented using uncertainty quantification techniques, effectively tolerates unseen transitions for improved "trajectory stitching," while enhancing the agent's ability to learn from realistic non-expert data.</description>

      <title>Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving up to 27.3$\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with around 2 to 4$\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.</description>

      <title>Ross3D: Reconstructive Visual Instruction Tuning with 3D-Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has spurred efforts to adapt these models for interpreting 3D scenes. However, the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. To address this issue, typical approaches focus on injecting 3D awareness into 2D LMMs by designing 3D input-level scene representations. This work provides a new perspective. We introduce reconstructive visual instruction tuning with 3D-awareness (Ross3D), which integrates 3D-aware visual supervision into the training procedure. Specifically, it incorporates cross-view and global-view reconstruction. The former requires reconstructing masked views by aggregating overlapping information from other views. The latter aims to aggregate information from all available views to recover Bird's-Eye-View images, contributing to a comprehensive overview of the entire scene. Empirically, Ross3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D scene understanding benchmarks. More importantly, our semi-supervised experiments demonstrate significant potential in leveraging large amounts of unlabeled 3D vision-only data.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Deceptiveness in Fitness Optimization with Unsupervised Quality-Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy optimization seeks the best solution to a control problem according to an objective or fitness function, serving as a fundamental field of engineering and research with applications in robotics. Traditional optimization methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms struggle with deceptive fitness landscapes, where following immediate improvements leads to suboptimal solutions. Quality-diversity (QD) algorithms offer a promising approach by maintaining diverse intermediate solutions as stepping stones for escaping local optima. However, QD algorithms require domain expertise to define hand-crafted features, limiting their applicability where characterizing solution diversity remains unclear. In this paper, we show that unsupervised QD algorithms - specifically the AURORA framework, which learns features from sensory data - efficiently solve deceptive optimization problems without domain expertise. By enhancing AURORA with contrastive learning and periodic extinction events, we propose AURORA-XCon, which outperforms all traditional optimization baselines and matches, in some cases even improving by up to 34%, the best QD baseline with domain-specific hand-crafted features. This work establishes a novel application of unsupervised QD algorithms, shifting their focus from discovering novel solutions toward traditional optimization and expanding their potential to domains where defining feature spaces poses challenges.</description>

Abstract: Several interesting problems in multi-robot systems can be cast in the framework of distributed optimization. Examples include multi-robot task allocation, vehicle routing, target protection, and surveillance. While the theoretical analysis of distributed optimization algorithms has received significant attention, its application to cooperative robotics has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we show how notable scenarios in cooperative robotics can be addressed by suitable distributed optimization setups. Specifically, after a brief introduction on the widely investigated consensus optimization (most suited for data analytics) and on the partition-based setup (matching the graph structure in the optimization), we focus on two distributed settings modeling several scenarios in cooperative robotics, i.e., the so-called constraint-coupled and aggregative optimization frameworks. For each one, we consider use-case applications, and we discuss tailored distributed algorithms with their convergence properties. Then, we revise state-of-the-art toolboxes allowing for the implementation of distributed schemes on real networks of robots without central coordinators. For each use case, we discuss its implementation in these toolboxes and provide simulations and real experiments on networks of heterogeneous robots.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers for End-to-End Vision-Based Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed vision-based quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional model-based approaches to navigation via independent perception, mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to have great potential for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all tested flight speeds. We assess performance at speeds of up to 7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.</description>

      <title>UniT: Data Efficient Tactile Representation with Generalization to Unseen Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UniT is an approach to tactile representation learning, using VQGAN to learn a compact latent space and serve as the tactile representation. It uses tactile images obtained from a single simple object to train the representation with generalizability. This tactile representation can be zero-shot transferred to various downstream tasks, including perception tasks and manipulation policy learning. Our benchmarkings on in-hand 3D pose and 6D pose estimation tasks and a tactile classification task show that UniT outperforms existing visual and tactile representation learning methods. Additionally, UniT's effectiveness in policy learning is demonstrated across three real-world tasks involving diverse manipulated objects and complex robot-object-environment interactions. Through extensive experimentation, UniT is shown to be a simple-to-train, plug-and-play, yet widely effective method for tactile representation learning.

      <title>A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available at https://github.com/IrmakDogan/ExpressionDataset.</description>

      <title>EPIC: A Lightweight LiDAR-Based UAV Exploration Framework for Large-Scale Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for various applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Recently, LiDAR-based exploration has gained significant attention due to its ability to generate high-precision point cloud maps of large-scale environments. While the point clouds are inherently informative for navigation, many existing exploration methods still rely on additional, often expensive, environmental representations. This reliance stems from two main reasons: the need for frontier detection or information gain computation, which typically depends on memory-intensive occupancy grid maps, and the high computational complexity of path planning directly on point clouds, primarily due to costly collision checking. To address these limitations, we present EPIC, a lightweight LiDAR-based UAV exploration framework that directly exploits point cloud data to explore large-scale environments. EPIC introduces a novel observation map derived directly from the quality of point clouds, eliminating the need for global occupancy grid maps while preserving comprehensive exploration capabilities. We also propose an incremental topological graph construction method operating directly on point clouds, enabling real-time path planning in large-scale environments. Leveraging these components, we build a hierarchical planning framework that generates agile and energy-efficient trajectories, achieving significantly reduced memory consumption and computation time compared to most existing methods. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that EPIC achieves faster exploration while significantly reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Bench4Merge: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Merging in Realistic Dense Traffic with Micro-Interactive Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging into dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning methods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them. Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues. The simulation environment and evaluation process can be accessed at https://github.com/WZM5853/Bench4Merge.</description>

      <title>Learning Dual-Arm Push and Grasp Synergy in Dense Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic grasping in densely cluttered environments is challenging due to scarce collision-free grasp affordances. Non-prehensile actions can increase feasible grasps in cluttered environments, but most research focuses on single-arm rather than dual-arm manipulation. Policies from single-arm systems fail to fully leverage the advantages of dual-arm coordination. We propose a target-oriented hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns dual-arm push-grasp synergy for grasping objects to enhance dexterous manipulation in dense clutter. Our framework maps visual observations to actions via a pre-trained deep learning backbone and a novel CNN-based DRL model, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to develop a dual-arm push-grasp strategy. The backbone enhances feature mapping in densely cluttered environments. A novel fuzzy-based reward function is introduced to accelerate efficient strategy learning. Our system is developed and trained in Isaac Gym and then tested in simulations and on a real robot. Experimental results show that our framework effectively maps visual data to dual push-grasp motions, enabling the dual-arm system to grasp target objects in complex environments. Compared to other methods, our approach generates 6-DoF grasp candidates and enables dual-arm push actions, mimicking human behavior. Results show that our method efficiently completes tasks in densely cluttered environments. https://sites.google.com/view/pg4da/home</description>

      <title>Learning Perceptive Humanoid Locomotion over Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are engineered to navigate terrains akin to those encountered by humans, which necessitates human-like locomotion and perceptual abilities. Currently, the most reliable controllers for humanoid motion rely exclusively on proprioception, a reliance that becomes both dangerous and unreliable when coping with rugged terrain. Although the integration of height maps into perception can enable proactive gait planning, robust utilization of this information remains a significant challenge, especially when exteroceptive perception is noisy. To surmount these challenges, we propose a solution based on a teacher-student distillation framework. In this paradigm, an oracle policy accesses noise-free data to establish an optimal reference policy, while the student policy not only imitates the teacher's actions but also simultaneously trains a world model with a variational information bottleneck for sensor denoising and state estimation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach markedly enhances performance in scenarios characterized by unreliable terrain estimations. Moreover, we conducted rigorous testing in both challenging urban settings and off-road environments, the model successfully traverse 2 km of varied terrain without external intervention.</description>

      <title>TeraSim: Uncovering Unknown Unsafe Events for Autonomous Vehicles through Generative Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers.

      <title>Efficient Alignment of Unconditioned Action Prior for Language-conditioned Pick and Place in Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are becoming commonplace in our lives. Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present VizFlyt, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on VizFlyt for the future. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL experiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and its large potential use cases.

      <title>Sim-and-Real Co-Training: A Simple Recipe for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist robot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences between the simulation and real-world data.

      <description>arXiv:2504.00236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible trajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in scenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for practical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system dynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a sequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with the diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both consistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical constraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories and accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers, even when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a complex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and collision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory generation in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Why Autonomous Vehicles Are Not Ready Yet: A Multi-Disciplinary Review of Problems, Attempted Solutions, and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Personal autonomous vehicles are cars, trucks and bikes capable of sensing their surrounding environment, planning their route, and driving with little or no involvement of human drivers. Despite the impressive technological achievements made by the industry in recent times and the hopeful announcements made by leading entrepreneurs, to date no personal vehicle is approved for road circulation in a 'fully' or 'semi' autonomous mode (autonomy levels 4 and 5) and it is still unclear when such vehicles will eventually be mature enough to receive this kind of approval. The present review adopts an integrative and multidisciplinary approach to investigate the major challenges faced by the automative sector, with the aim to identify the problems that still trouble and delay the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. The review examines the limitations and risks associated with current technologies and the most promising solutions devised by the researchers. This negative assessment methodology is not motivated by pessimism, but by the aspiration to raise critical awareness about the technology's state-of-the-art, the industry's quality standards, and the society's demands and expectations. While the survey primarily focuses on the applications of artificial intelligence for perception and navigation, it also aims to offer an enlarged picture that links the purely technological aspects with the relevant human-centric aspects, including, cultural attitudes, conceptual assumptions, and normative (ethico-legal) frameworks. Examining the broader context serves to highlight problems that have a cross-disciplinary scope and identify solutions that may benefit from a holistic consideration.</description>

      <title>V2V-LLM: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current autonomous driving vehicles rely mainly on their individual sensors to understand surrounding scenes and plan for future trajectories, which can be unreliable when the sensors are malfunctioning or occluded. To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multi-Modal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field. Our project website: https://eddyhkchiu.github.io/v2vllm.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Transfer1: Conditional World Generation with Adaptive Multimodal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI, including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation with an NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack. To help accelerate research development in the field, we open-source our models and code at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1.</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.</description>

      <title>Can DeepSeek Reason Like a Surgeon? An Empirical Evaluation for Vision-Language Understanding in Robotic-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek series have demonstrated outstanding performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to its efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of the DeepSeek model in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our comprehensive evaluation results indicate that, when provided with specific prompts, DeepSeek-V3 performs well in surgical instrument and tissue recognition tasks However, DeepSeek-V3 exhibits significant limitations in spatial position analysis and struggles to understand surgical actions accurately. Additionally, our findings reveal that, under general prompts, DeepSeek-V3 lacks the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fails to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek-V3 is not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.</description>
