      <title>A Universal Thermodynamic Inequality: Scaling Relations Between Current, Activity, and Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic bound constraining directional transport in both discrete and continuous nonequilibrium systems. For continuous-time Markov jump processes and overdamped diffusions governed by Fokker--Planck equations, we prove the inequality $ \frac{2 V(t)^2}{A(t)} \leq \dot{e}_p(t), $ linking the squared net velocity $V(t)$, entropy production rate $\dot{e}_p(t)$, and dynamical activity $A(t)$. This relation captures a fundamental trade-off between transport, dissipation, and fluctuation intensity, valid far from equilibrium and without detailed balance. In addition, we introduce dimensionless thermodynamic ratios that quantify dissipation asymmetry, entropy extraction, and relaxation. These scaling laws unify discrete and continuous stochastic thermodynamics and provide experimentally accessible constraints on transport efficiency in nanoscale machines and active systems.</description>

      <title>Memory-aware feedback enhances power in active information engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement cycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated fluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback strategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for such memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the potential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We show that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal baths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of bath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we introduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain the covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby exploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic analysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of positional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles. In particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains outperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay between bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding principles for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium environments.</description>

      <title>Neo-Gibbsian Statistical Energetics with Applications to Nonequilibrium Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization through novel interpretations of the inner logic of the century-old Gibbs' statistical thermodynamics is presented: i) Identifying $k_B\to 0$ as classical energetics, one directly derives a pair of thermodynamic variational formulae \[
  F(T) = \min_{E\ge E_{min}}\Big\{E-TS(E) \Big\}
  \,\text{ and }\
  S(E) = \min_{T&gt;0}\left\{\frac{E}{T}-\frac{F(T)}{T} \right\}, \] that dictate all the more familiar $1/T=d S(E)/d E$, $E=d\{F(T)/T\}/d(1/T)$, and $S(E)=-d F(T)/d T$ in equilibrium, which is maintained by a duality symmetry with one-to-one relation between $T^{\text{eq}}(E)=\arg\min_T\{E/T-F(T)/T\}$ and $E^{\text{eq}}(T)=\arg\min_E\{E-TS(E)\}$. ii) In contradistinction, taking derivative of the statistical free energy w.r.t. $T$, a mesoscopic energetics with fluctuations emerges: This yields two information entropy functions which historically appeared 50 years postdate Gibbs' theory. iii) Combining the above pair of inequalities yields an irreversible thermodynamic potential $\psi(T,E) \equiv \{E-F(T)\}/T-S(E)\ge 0$ for nonequilibrium states. The second law of thermodynamics as a universal principle reflects $\psi\ge 0$ due to a disagreement between $E$ and $T$ as a dual pair. Our theory provides a new energetics of living cells which are nonequilibrium, complex entities under constant $T$, pressure $p$ and chemical potential $\mu$. $\psi$ provides a ``distance'' between statistical data from a large ensemble of cells and a set of intrinsic energetic parameters that encode the information within.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to numerically evaluate the Lehmann representation for the finite temperature single-particle Green's function in the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This allows us to determine the spectral function in the full range of temperatures and interactions, as well as in generalized Gibbs ensembles. We test our results against the known limit of infinite interaction strength and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigations around the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem on Log-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recent concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices, we investigate the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (GCFT) in the context of fluid mechanics. The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated.</description>

      <title>Jerky chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce jerky chiral active Brownian particles (jcABPs), a generalization of conventional chiral active Brownian particles (cABPs) subjected to jerk, the time derivative of acceleration, and analytically derive their mean displacement and mean squared displacement (MSD). Our results show that jerk induces anomalous fluctuations and oscillatory behavior on the standard circular swimming of chiral active particles. The interplay of jerk, chirality and persistence produces a family of mean trajectories including damped and exploding Lissajous patterns alongside the well-known spira mirabilis (logarithmic spirals). Our work on jerky chiral active particles opens a new route to explore rich dynamical effects in active matter.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems and the grand canonical ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Lindblad equation governs the non-unitary time evolution of density operators used in the description of open quantum systems. It is usually derived from the von Neumann equation for a large system, at given physical conditions, when a small subsystem is explicitly singled out and the rest of the system acts as an environment whose degrees of freedom are traced out. In the specific case of a subsystem with variable particle number, the equilibrium density operator is given by the well-known grand canonical Gibbs state. Consequently, solving the Lindblad equation in this case should automatically yield, without any additional assumptions, the corresponding density operator in the limiting case of statistical equilibrium. Current studies of the Lindblad equation with varying particle number assume, however, the grand canonical Gibbs state a priori: the chemical potential is externally imposed rather than derived from first principles, and hence the corresponding density operator is not obtained as a natural solution of the equation. In this work, we investigate the compatibility of grand canonical statistical mechanics with the derivation of the Lindblad equation. We propose an alternative and complementary approach to the current literature that consists in using a generalized system Hamiltonian which includes a term $\mu N$. In a previous paper, this empirically well-known term has been formally derived from the von Neumann equation for the specific case of equilibrium. Including $\mu N$ in the system Hamiltonian leads to a modified Lindblad equation which yields the grand canonical state as a natural solution, meaning that all the quantities involved are obtained from the physics of the system without any external assumptions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional unfrustrated and frustrated quantum Heisenberg magnets. Specific heat study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg magnet on four three-dimensional lattices -- simple-cubic, diamond, pyrochlore, and hyperkagome ones -- for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interaction in order to illustrate the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature thermodynamic properties with a focus on the specific heat $c(T)$. To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Thermal Correlators and Black Holes: From Infinity to Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-informed quantum-classical dynamics (DIQCD) approach for predicting the evolution of an open quantum system. The equation of motion in DIQCD is a Lindblad equation with a flexible, time-dependent Hamiltonian that can be optimized to fit sparse and noisy data from local observations of an extensive open quantum system. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of DIQCD for both experimental and simulated quantum devices. We show that DIQCD can predict entanglement dynamics of ultracold molecules (Calcium Fluoride) in optical tweezer arrays. DIQCD also successfully predicts carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (Rubrene) with accuracy comparable to nearly exact numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation enables highly selective viral genome packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many viruses, hundreds of proteins assemble an outer shell (capsid) around the viral nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. How the assembly process selects the viral genome amidst a vast excess of diverse cellular nucleic acids is poorly understood. It has recently been discovered that many viruses perform assembly and genome packaging within liquid-liquid phase separated biomolecular condensates inside the host cell. However, the role of condensates in genome packaging is poorly understood. Here, we construct equilibrium and dynamical rate equation models for condensate-coupled assembly and genome packaging. We show that when the viral genome and capsid proteins favorably partition into the condensate, assembly rates, yields, and packaging efficiencies can increase by orders of magnitude. Selectivity is further enhanced by the condensate when capsid proteins are translated during assembly and packaging. Our results suggest that viral condensates provide a mechanism to ensure robust and highly selective assembly of virions around viral genomes. More broadly, our results may apply to other types of selective co-assembly processes that occur within biomolecular condensates, and suggest that liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates could be exploited for selective encapsulation of microscopic cargo in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling behavior of Randers-Finsler massless scalar field theories in the infrared regime. For that, we compute analytically the radiative corrections to the corresponding anomalous dimensions, related to the critical exponents of the theory, first up to next-to-leading loop order and later for all-loop levels. We consider the effect of the Randers-Finsler space-time properties on the critical exponents by considering the parameter characterizing those space-times in its exact form. We employ field-theoretic renormalization group and $\epsilon$-expansion techniques at dimensions $d = 4 - \epsilon$ through three distinct and independent methods. At the end, we furnish the physical interpretation of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While prior studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level, it remains largely elusive whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Surprisingly, we find that exceptional points are neither sufficient nor necessary for the QMPE in this context, contrasting previous findings. Specifically, we show that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Owing to the complete suppression of the slowest relaxation mode facilitated by parity-time symmetry, we attribute the observed QMPE to a cooperative effect of remaining relaxation modes. We obtain analytical expressions that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the QMPE. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also reveal its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general machine learning methodology that integrates classical shadow representations with unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to explore various quantum phase transitions. By sampling spin configurations from random Pauli measurements, our approach can effectively analyze hidden statistical patterns in the data, thereby capturing the distinct signatures of quantum criticality through their fluctuations. We benchmark this approach across various spin-1/2 systems, including the 1D XZX cluster-Ising model, the 1D bond-alternating XXZ model, the 2D transverse-field Ising model, and the 2D Kitaev honeycomb model. We show that PCA not only reliably detects and distinguishes both symmetry-breaking and topological transitions, but also enables their qualitative classification based on characteristic fluctuation patterns. Our data-driven approach does not require any knowledge of the Hamiltonian or explicit order parameters, and can therefore be a general and applicable tool for probing new quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Succession of Ising criticality and its threshold in critical quantum Ising model subject to symmetric decoherence</title>

Abstract: We investigate a mixed state quantum criticality in the Ising model under $X+ZZ$ decoherence. In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\eta=0.25$ and, $\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a new formalism describing the anomalous diffusion processes, based on the Onsager-Machlup fluctuation theory, has been suggested \cite{Smain, Spub}. We study particles performing this new type of motion, under the action of resetting at a constant rate, or Poissonian resetting. We derive the mean-squared displacement and probability density function, and investigate their dependence on the shape parameter, diffusion coefficient, potential strength and resetting rate.</description>

      <title>Dynamical patterns and nonreciprocal effective interactions in an active-passive mixture through exact hydrodynamic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of dynamical patterns is one of the most striking features of nonequilibrium physical systems. Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as nonreciprocal interactions. These nonequilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities, which reveal effective nonreciprocal couplings between the active and passive species. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ behaves similarly to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\rm c}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\rm c}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</description>

      <title>Problem hardness of diluted Ising models: Population Annealing versus Simulated Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial damping of magnetization currents in perturbed spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Taylor Dispersion of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle with Center Offset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taylor dispersion, the gravity-induced enhancement of translational diffusion during the steady settling of a Brownian particle, has so far been analyzed only for torque-free bodies (H. Brenner, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 71(2): 189-208, 1979). In this work, we extend the theory to a non-centrosymmetric, axisymmetric particle whose centers of mass and buoyancy are offset from its hydrodynamic center, so that the gravitational torque acts in addition to the net gravitational force. We study the Taylor dispersion of such particles as a function of non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ representing the strength of the gravitational torque: $\alpha$ is zero when the centers of mass and buoyancy are at the hydrodynamic center and increases when they are offset from it. Analytical calculations show that for small $\alpha$, the Taylor dispersion is always amplified: the effective diffusivities created by sedimentation always increase as $\alpha^2$, but they start to decrease at certain values of $\alpha$ and approach to zero for large values of $\alpha$. We further analyze the transient regime of the mean-square displacement (MSD). At short times, the MSD grows quadratically with time before crossing over to the diffusive regime. The ballistic regime persists to relatively high sedimentation P\'eclet numbers (the ratio of the rotational relaxation time to the sedimentation time), even in the presence of a gravitational torque, indicating that such a torque does not considerably alter sustained ballistic motion.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling of percolation on scale-free networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k \sim k^{-\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one controlled by the degree exponent $\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K \sim V^{\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ is the cutoff exponent. Increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\kappa$ suppresses heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality. In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical clarification of previous theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish fundamental trade-offs between the precision achievable in quantum systems and associated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy production or dynamical activity. While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$, both meeting at a saddle point with radius $r_{+s}$ at temperature $T_s$. We derive the thermodynamics, finding that the heat capacity diverges at the turning point $T_s$ for each solution. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a transition to hot flat space with charge at infinity. For a given $Q$ and $T&gt;T_s$, there is only hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d=4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d=5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify disordered phases in a system of oppositely charged colloids. In this system, the interplay between Coulomb and van der Waals interactions leads to transitions in local structures, while the global structure remains disordered. Our method involves representing the local structures of the system as high-dimensional vectors and applying principal component analysis to identify distinct features of each phase. We demonstrate that our method results in a reasonable classification of disordered phases, which is consistent with that obtained from radial distribution functions. The interpretability of the method reveals the key characteristics of each phase and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the unconventional phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Fine Spectrum from Crude Analytic Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the KMP model to the KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on quantum dynamical entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</description>
