      <title>Morphologies arising from the gas flow in the innermost kiloparsec of barred galaxy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies.
  Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence.
  Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems.
  Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals. The best alignment between our models and structures observed in local barred galaxies is achieved by assuming a sound speed of $c_s=20\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>The early Universe with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.</description>

      <title>Gasflows in Barred Galaxies with Big Orbital Loops-A Comparative Study of Two Hydrocodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flow of gas in a barred-galaxy model, in which a considerable part of the underlying stable periodic orbits have loops where, close to the ends of the bar, several orbital families coexist and chaos dominates. Such conditions are typically encountered in a zone between the 4:1 resonance and corotation. The purpose of our study is to understand the gaseous flow in the aforementioned environment and trace the morphology of the shocks that form. We use two conceptually different hydrodynamic schemes for our calculations, namely, the mesh-free Lagrangian SPH method and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This allows us to compare responses by means of the two algorithms. We find that the big loops of the orbits, mainly belonging to the x1 stable periodic orbits, do not help the shock loci to approach corotation. They deviate away from the regions occupied by the loops, bypass them and form extensions at an angle with the straight-line shocks. Roughly at the distance from the center at which we start to observe the big loops, we find characteristic "tails" of dense gas streaming towards the straight-line shocks. The two codes give complementary information for understanding the hydrodynamics of the models.</description>

      <title>Investigating HII Regions in the Disk of NGC 7331 with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ionized gas kinematics of HII regions in the disk of NGC 7331 using integral field unit data collected with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph (CH$\alpha$S). NGC 7331 is a well-studied nearby galaxy with HII regions resolved by seeing-limited observations, making it ideally suited for this work. The galaxy disk features vigorous star formation, especially in the central ring of starburst activity. We present a catalog of 136 HII regions detected in the SIRTF Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) H$\alpha$ image. Using this refined catalog, we perform aperture photometry on the SINGS narrowband H$\alpha$ images of NGC 7331, extracting the H$\alpha$ luminosity L(H$\alpha$) of these regions. We present corresponding measurements of the average line-of-sight ionized gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$ in these HII regions with CH$\alpha$S. High-resolution velocity and dispersion maps of the galactic disk are produced from the CH$\alpha$S spectral imaging, selecting spaxels with high signal to noise in order to measure velocity dispersions as low as 12 km s$^{-1}$. Our measurements of the L(H$\alpha$), $\rm \Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\sigma$ in NGC 7331 are consistent with spatially resolved observations of HII regions in large surveys of nearby galaxies. We explore the L(H$\alpha$)$- \sigma$ relationship, identifying turbulent HII regions with nonthermal dispersions likely driven by stellar feedback. The dispersion is correlated with the star formation rate surface density, and using the relation $\rm \sigma \propto \epsilon \Sigma_{SFR}^{\alpha}$, HII regions in NGC 7331 are best fit by $\epsilon = 80$ , $\alpha =0.285$.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen enhancement of GN-z11 by metal pollution from supermassive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift ($z$) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Str\"omgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.</description>

      <title>A catalogue of Type 2 active galactic nuclei in the 6dF Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the compact, energetic central regions of galaxies, powered by supermassive black holes that accrete surrounding gas and dust. Their optical spectra can be identified by strong emission-line signatures (broad and/or narrow lines). Those showing only narrow lines are classified as 'Type 2' AGN. Extensive surveys like SDSS cover AGN in the Northern Sky, but the equivalent coverage in the Southern Sky remains limited. We address this by presenting a new catalogue of Type 2 AGN from the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), which has 136,304 spectra covering roughly 17{,}000~\mathrm{deg}^2, mainly of low-redshift galaxies. We use a median absolute deviation cut on the continuum-fitted spectrum to select emission line galaxies. AGN were identified by fitting the 6dFGS spectra with a modified Python QSO fitting tool (PyQSOFit). All selected spectra were visually inspected and corrected for fitting errors where necessary. 10,492 narrow emission line galaxies were identified in 6dFGS, including 5000 Type 2 AGN classified from Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) diagram. They have a median redshift of z$ \sim 0.032$ and a median $[\mathrm{O\,III}]$ luminosity of $\Log(L_{[\mathrm{O\,III}]}/ergs s^{-1}) \sim 40.04$.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: The planetary nebula population of M 33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this pilot study, we investigate the PN population in M~33, a nearby spiral galaxy ($\simeq 840$~kpc), using data from the DR3 of the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a 12-band photometric dataset extensively used to identify H$\alpha$ line emitters. From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$\alpha$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe.</description>

      <title>Dual AGNs on 100 kpc Scales from the Million Quasar Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is crucial for understanding the coevolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, the current number of dual AGNs remains scarce. In this work, we selected 173 new dual AGNs, 4 AGN triplets, and 1 AGN quadruplet from the Million Quasars Catalog, all with low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$), a projected distance ($r_p$) of no more than 100 kpc, and a line-of-sight velocity difference ($|\Delta v|$) of less than 600 km s$^{-1}$, thus supplementing existing low-redshift dual AGNs demographics. Visual inspection of the optical images from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Survey was performed for each pair, revealing that $\sim$16\% of pairs exhibit tidal features. Statistical analyses show an increasing number of dual AGNs with decreasing redshift, with velocity difference primarily at $|\Delta v| &lt; $ 300 km s$^{-1}$, which is likely an artifact of our selection strategy. The tidal sample peaks as having 13 pairs at 5-20$h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc, but drops to 1 pair $&gt; 55\,h^{-1}_{70}$ kpc. Our study also explores thewide separation ($r_p&gt;10$ kpc) dual AGNs, finding 165 such systems, with 25 displaying clear tidal features. Furthermore, some extra galaxies, AGNs, and/or their candidates were found in the same regions of the pairs or multiplets forming interacting systems with these pairs or multiplets.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Radio Galaxy Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio telescope surveys, capable of detecting billions of galaxies in wide-field surveys, have made manual morphological classification impracticable. This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO.</description>

      <title>Rapid emergence of overmassive black holes in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z&gt;4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$\alpha$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\sim 3 \times 10^7 ~M_\text{sun}$ by $z \sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Through Thick and Thin: The Cosmic Evolution of Disk Scale Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the formation and evolution of vertical structures in disk galaxies, we measure global $\operatorname{sech}^2$ scale heights, averaging thin and thick components when present, for 2631 edge-on disk galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ at $0&lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $\mu$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The disk length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\pm0.2$ for $z&gt;1.5$, but rises to $4.0\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\approx2$ and dominates at $z\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\pm0.1$ at $z=0$. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems.</description>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei are known to exhibit flux variations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Among these, correlations between UV/optical and X-ray flux variations serve as a key diagnostics for understanding the physical connection between the accretion disk and the corona. In this work, we present the results of analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray flux variations in the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 1044. Simultaneous observations in the far-UV band (FUV: 1300$-$1800 \AA) and the X-ray band (0.5$-$7 keV) obtained during 31 August $-$ 8 September 2018 with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Soft X-ray Telescope onboard \textit{AstroSat} were used for this study. Significant flux variability was detected in both FUV and X-ray bands. The fractional root mean square variability amplitude ($F_{\rm var}$) was found to be 0.036 $\pm$ 0.001 in the FUV band and 0.384 $\pm$ 0.004 in the X-ray band. To explore potential time lag between the two bands, cross-correlation analysis was performed using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and just another vehicle for estimating lags in nuclei (JAVELIN) methods. Results from both approaches are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainty, indicating that X-ray variations lead the FUV variations, with measured lags of 2.25$\pm$0.05 days (ICCF) and $2.35_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ days (JAVELIN). This is the first detection of a time delay between UV and X-ray variations in Mrk 1044. The observed UV lag supports the disk reprocessing scenario, wherein X-ray emission from the corona irradiates the accretion disk, driving the observed UV variability.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the 3D structure of the central molecular zone from stellar kinematics and photometry: The 50 and 20 km/s clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central molecular zone (CMZ), surrounding the Galactic centre, is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy. Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -- the 50 and 20 km/s clouds -- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\pm8$ pc and $56\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge.</description>

      <title>The dynamical and thermodynamic effects of turbulence on the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06593v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both simulations and observations indicate that the so-called missing baryons reside in the intergalactic medium known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this study we employed the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that knowledge of the turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the Universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, and prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as the redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and converted into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding accounts for the origin of the WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, calls into question the traditional view of shock-heating, and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that the spatial resolution, box size, and sub-grid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $\Delta S_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(\xi\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $\xi={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Formation of the Young "Fermi Bubbles" in the Circinus Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Can tidal disruption event models reliably measure black hole masses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.</description>

      <title>The X-ray properties and structure of A3571 up to $R_{500}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase. This work also demonstrates the excellent capability of EP-FXT for probing the outskirts of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The effect of metallicity on the Leavitt Law using phase-dependent properties of classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute calibration of period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW) and its nearby galaxies has been a cornerstone in determining extragalactic distances and the current local expansion rate of the Universe. However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(\gamma)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\rm BP}$, $G_{\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values between the short- $(0.4 \leq \log{P} &lt; 1)$ and long-period $(1 \leq \log{P} &lt; 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study.</description>

      <title>Mutual Orbit Alignment in Resolved Triple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N-body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than $\sim$100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Symbolically regressing dark matter halo profiles using weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of self-gravitating fermions as a robust theory for dark matter halos: Stability analysis applied to the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for dark matter (DM) halo formation based on a kinetic theory of self-gravitating fermions together with a solid connection to thermodynamics. Based on maximum entropy arguments, this approach predicts a most likely phase-space distribution which takes into account the Pauli exclusion principle, relativistic effects, and particle evaporation. The most general equilibrium configurations depend on the particle mass and develop a degenerate compact core embedded in a diluted halo, both linked by their fermionic nature. By applying such a theory to the Milky Way we analyze the stability of different families of equilibrium solutions with implications on the DM distribution and the mass of the DM candidate. We find that stable core-halo profiles, which explain the DM distribution in the Galaxy, exist only in the range $mc^2 \approx 194 - 387\,\rm{keV}$. The lower bound is a consequence of imposing thermodynamical stability on the core-halo solutions having a $4.2\times 10^6 M_\odot$ quantum core mass alternative to the black hole hypothesis at the Galaxy center. The upper bound is solely an outcome of general relativity when the quantum core reaches the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and undergoes gravitational collapse towards a black hole. We demonstrate that there exists a set of stable core-halo profiles which are astrophysically relevant in the sense that their total mass is finite, do not suffer from the gravothermal catastrophe, and agree with observations. The morphology of the outer halo tail is described by a polytrope of index $5/2$, developing a sharp decline of the density beyond $25\,\rm{kpc}$ in excellent agreement with the latest Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. Moreover, we obtain a total mass of about $2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ including baryons and a local DM density of about $0.4\,\rm{GeV}\,c^{-2}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$ in line with recent independent estimates.</description>

Abstract: The well-known discrepancy in galactic rotation curves refers to the mismatch between observed rotational velocities and the velocities predicted by baryonic matter. In this study we investigate a potential pattern in the discrepancy, which may point to an underlying pattern in dark-halo distributions. By looking at rotational-velocity curves from an alternate perspective, the angular-velocity curves, it appears that the observed angular velocities and their corresponding baryonic predictions differ by a constant shift. That is, the discrepancy may be reduced to a constant angular-velocity term, independent of the radius. We test the generality of the suggested property by analysing 143 high-quality rotation curves. The property appears significant as it performs equally well (or better) than well-established dark-halo models. Compared to a Burkert profile, it is preferred in 60% of the cases, while relative to a Navarro Frenk White profile (NFW), it is superior in 73% of the cases. Next, by including the new phenomenological property within the dynamical equations, we find an explicit expression for the dark-halo profile. The new single-parameter profile is characterised by a remarkable property: it is intrinsically related to the baryonic distribution. Thus, information regarding the cuspy or cored nature of a particular dark halo, according to this profile, is encoded (and explicitly determined) by the respective baryonic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution and influence of dust in cosmological simulations that include the cold phase of the interstellar medium</title>

Abstract: While marginal in mass terms, dust grains play an outsized role in both the physics and observation of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, explicit modelling of this ISM constituent remains uncommon in large cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a model for the life-cycle of dust in the ISM that couples to the forthcoming COLIBRE galaxy formation model, which explicitly simulates the cold ISM. We follow 6 distinct grain types: 3 chemical species, including carbon and two silicate grains, with 2 size bins each. Our dust model accounts for seeding of grains from stellar ejecta, self-consistent element-by-element metal yields and growth by accretion, grain size transfer (shattering and coagulation) and destruction of dust by thermal sputtering in the ISM. We detail the calibration of this model, particularly the use of a clumping factor, to account for unresolved gas clouds in which dust readily evolves. We present a fiducial run in a 25$^3$~cMpc$^3$ cosmological volume that displays good agreement with observations of the cosmic evolution of dust density, as well as the $z=0$ galaxy dust mass function and dust scaling relations. We highlight known tensions between observational datasets of the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of metallicity depending on which metallicity calibrator is used; our model favours higher-normalisation metallicity calibrators, which agree with the observations within 0.1~dex for stellar masses $&gt;10^9 \; {\rm M_\odot}$. We compare the grain size distribution to observations of local galaxies, and find that our simulation suggests a higher concentration of small grains, associated with more diffuse ISM and the warm-neutral medium (WNM), which both play a key role in boosting H$_2$ content. Putting these results and modelling approaches in context, we set the stage for upcoming insights into the dusty ISM of galaxies using the COLIBRE simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Attenuation Curves in Local Star-Forming Galaxies: Geometry Effect, Dust Evolution, and ISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-parametric approach, the Stellar Population Synthesis with Equivalent Widths (SEW) method, to reconstruct spectrally-resolved attenuation curves for 169,568 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). Composite attenuation curves, stacked by stellar mass and inclination, reveal systematic trends: a higher stellar mass correlates with steeper slopes (lower $R_V$), while edge-on galaxies exhibit flatter curves due to geometric saturation effects. This flattening occurs because, as optical depth increases along the line of sight, the observed light becomes increasingly dominated by emission from the outer, less obscured layers of the galaxy. Using a simplified radiative transfer treatment based on a uniform dust-star mixture, we find the inclination-dependent slope variations are consistent with geometric effects, whereas the mass-dependent slope steepening indicates evolution in intrinsic dust properties, suggesting feedback-driven grain fragmentation in massive galaxies. Additionally, intermediate-scale structures (ISSs) are tentatively identified in the attenuation curves at approximately 4870, 6370, and 7690 \r{A}. These results illustrate how the interplay among dust-star geometry, grain size evolution, and the galactic environment shapes attenuation curves.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is in principle feasible to infer the population properties of the most numerous of LISA sources -- Galactic double white dwarfs -- directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series by adopting a simulation-based approach, without extracting and estimating the parameters of each single source. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. This approach can be extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals) and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps), provided that fast and accurate simulations are available.</description>

      <title>Linking enhanced star formation and quenching to faint tidal features in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with SDSS-derived data to investigate how the presence and specific nature of these features correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that our 688 tidal feature galaxies are 6.6$\pm$0.9 times more likely to be in a starburst phase and 19.6$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts) than a sample of 4073 controls matched in both stellar mass and redshift. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features were $\sim$1.3-4.0 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features were $\sim$2.3-5.3 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity (from a sample of $\sim$2100) and find no significant difference between those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The star cluster systems of the Local Group dwarf galaxies IC 10 and NGC 6822</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity [abridged].</description>

      <title>Distance measurements from the internal dynamics of globular clusters: Application to the Sombrero galaxy (M104)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive galaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\Delta\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\sigma &gt; 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M104, finding $D=9.00\pm0.29$ (stat.)~$\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M31 $M_V-\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $&lt;M/L_V&gt; = 2.6 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V &lt; -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.</description>

      <title>Dark-Matter-Deficient Galaxies from Collisions: A New Probe of Bursty Feedback and Dark Matter Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for dark-matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive DMDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, perturbing DMDG masses without clear enhancement. This differs from what happens in host halos, where SIDM-induced cores enhance dark matter tidal stripping while keeping baryons compact and resilient to tidal effects. The contrasting roles of SIDM may provide a means to distinguish feedback-formed halo cores from those created by SIDM. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher DMDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $&gt;100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</description>

      <title>A z ~ 0.4 Galaxy Reflecting the high-redshift Little Red Dots: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z &gt; 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z ~ 6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRD-like galaxies have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z LRD-like galaxies, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4330, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 solar mass per year, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~ 60%, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 solar masses, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.</description>

      <title>The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z~5 : reconciling observations with simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic collimated outflows, or jets, provide a crucial mode of active galactic nucleus feedback. Although jets extract their energy from the black hole (BH) rotation, their effect on the BH spin is poorly understood. Because the spin controls radiative and mechanical BH feedback, lack of first-principles models for spin evolution limits our ability to interpret observations, including the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA spin constraints. Particularly important are luminous disks, which rapidly grow and strongly torque their BHs. Jetless and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks spin up their BHs to near-maximum spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$. However, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk to enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently extract BH rotational energy and significantly spin down the BH. Lowell et al. (2024) found that nonradiative, thick MADs spin down their BHs to very low $a_{eq,MAD}^{thick}=0.07$. Their analytic model predicted that luminous, thin MADs also spin down their BHs to low $a_{eq,MAD}^{thin}\sim0.3\text{-}0.5$. To test this prediction, we perform 3D general relativistic (radiation) magnetohydrodynamic (GR(R)MHD) simulations of MADs across a wide range of BH spin ($-0.9\le{}a\le0.99$) and disk thickness ($0.03\le{}h/r\le0.3$, which corresponds to Eddington ratio, $0.35\le{}\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{Edd}\le\infty$). We find that luminous, thin MADs ($0.03\le{}h/r\le0.1$) efficiently spin down their BHs to a low universal equilibrium spin value, $a_{eq,MAD}^{thin}\approx0.3$: a maximally spinning BH ($a=1$) spins down to $a=0.5$ after accreting just $25\%$ of its initial mass. Our results follow quadratic convergence, $a_{eq,MAD}^{fit}\simeq0.3-2.7(h/r)^2\to0.3$ as $h/r\to0$, which we attribute to the aggressive cooling that renders disk thermodynamics irrelevant and magnetic forces insensitive to thermal $h/r$.</description>

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing galaxy clustering in the nonlinear regime is galaxy assembly bias, which describes the dependence of galaxy clustering on halo properties beyond halo mass. We study this effect by analyzing galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass, luminosity, and broad-band colors from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We find that galaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number density, and redshift of the galaxy sample, with this effect increasing or decreasing galaxy clustering by as much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures the strength of galaxy assembly bias for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical models predicting galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo property cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, we investigate how galaxy assembly bias arises from the interplay between halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than halo mass -- and occupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary halo properties. We provide a fast analytical expression to predict the level of galaxy assembly bias induced by any halo property in simulated galaxy catalogs without the need for computationally expensive shuffling techniques.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>
