      <title>Topological representations for frame-valued domains via $L$-sobriety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a frame $L$ as the truth value table, we study the topological representations for frame-valued domains. We introduce the notions of locally super-compact $L$-topological space and strong locally super-compact $L$-topological space. Using these concepts, continuous $L$-dcpos and algebraic $L$-dcpos are successfully represented via $L$-sobriety. By means of Scott $L$-topology and specialization $L$-order, we establish a categorical isomorphism between the category of the continuous (resp., algebraic) $L$-dcpos with Scott continuous maps and that of the locally super-compact (resp., strong locally super-compact) $L$-sober spaces with continuous maps. As an application, for a continuous $L$-poset $P$, we obtain a categorical isomorphism between the category of directed completions of $P$ with Scott continuous maps and that of the $L$-sobrifications of $(P, \sigma_{L}(P))$ with continuous maps.</description>

      <title>Chessboard and level sets of continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the following result: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. We also provide a discrete version of this result which is inspired by the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem. Additionally, we show that the latter one and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of the main result.</description>

      <title>Consistency and independence phenomena involving cellular-Lindelof spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular-Lindel\"of property is a common generalization of the Lindel\"of property and the countable chain condition that was introduced by Bella and Spadaro in 2018. We solve two questions of Alas, Gutierrez-Dominguez and Wilson by constructing consistent examples of a normal almost cellular-Lindel\"of space which is neither cellular-Lindel\"of nor weakly Lindel\"of and a Tychonoff cellular-Lindel\"of space of Lindel\"of degree $\omega_1$ and uncountable weak Lindel\"of degree for closed sets. We also construct a ZFC example of a space for which both the cellular-Lindel\"of property and normality are undetermined in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Chirality Effects in Molecular Chainmail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of positive Gaussian curvature in kinetoplast DNA networks, we consider the effect of linking chirality in square lattice molecular chainmail networks using Langevin dynamics simulations and constrained gradient optimization. Linking chirality here refers to ordering of over-under versus under-over linkages between a loop and its neighbors. We consider fully alternating linking, maximally non-alternating, and partially non-alternating linking chiralities. We find that in simulations of polymer chainmail networks, the linking chirality dictates the sign of the Gaussian curvature of the final state of the chainmail membranes. Alternating networks have positive Gaussian curvature, similar to what is observed in kinetoplast DNA networks. Maximally non-alternating networks form isotropic membranes with negative Gaussian curvature. Partially non-alternating networks form flat diamond-shaped sheets which undergo a thermal folding transition when sufficiently large, similar to the crumpling transition in tethered membranes. We further investigate this topology-curvature relationship on geometric grounds by considering the tightest possible configurations and the constraints that must be satisfied to achieve them.</description>

      <title>On uniformly continuous surjections between function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider uniformly continuous surjections between $C_p(X)$ and $C_p(Y)$ (resp, $C_p^*(X)$ and $C_p^*(Y$)) and show that if $X$ has some dimensional-like properties, then so does $Y$. In particular, we prove that if $T:C_p(X)\to C_p(Y)$ is a continuous linear surjection, then $\dim Y=0$ if $\dim X=0$. This provides a positive answer to a question raised by Kawamura-Leiderman \cite[Problem 3.1]{kl}.</description>
