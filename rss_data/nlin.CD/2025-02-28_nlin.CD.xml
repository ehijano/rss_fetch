      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the timescales and information flow associated by multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system through a novel new interpretation of transfer entropy. Our goal is to provide a detailed understanding of the nature of complex energy transfer in nonlinear dispersive systems driven by wave mixing. Further, we present a modal decomposition method based on the empirical wavelet transform that produces a relatively small number of nearly decorrelated, scale separated modes. Using our method, we are able to track multiscale energy transfer using only scalar time series measurements of a weakly turbulent system. This points to our approach being of broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Bellman Differential Dynamic Programming for Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization with Path Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm to solve constrained nonlinear optimal control problem, with an emphasis on low-thrust trajectory in highly nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm, dubbed Pontryagin-Bellman Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP), is the result of the incorporation of Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) into the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) formulation. Unlike traditional indirect methods that rely on first-order shooting techniques to determine the optimal costate, PDDP optimizes the costates using a null-space trust-region method, solving a series of quadratic subproblems derived from first- and second-order sensitivities. Terminal equality constraints are handled via a general augmented Lagrangian method, while state-path constraints are enforced using a quadratic penalty approach. The resulting solution method represents a significant improvement over classical indirect methods, which are known to be ineffective for state-constrained problems. The use of DDP to optimize the costate partially reduces the inherent sensitivities of indirect methods, thereby improving the robustness to poor initial guess. Finally, the incorporation of PMP within the DDP formulation enables the design of long-duration, multi-spiral low-thrust trajectories with fewer optimization variables compared to classical DDP formulations. Although the paper emphasizes the spacecraft low-thrust trajectory optimization problem, the theoretical foundations are general and applicable to any control-affine optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in two representative quantum mechanical models at both infinite and finite temperature: the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our findings align with established results from spectral statistics and OTOCs, while introducing an operator-independent diagnostic for quantum chaos, offering more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of the general properties of quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of chaotic dynamics in random modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>
