      <title>Speeding Up the NSGA-II via Dynamic Population Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are among the most widely and successfully applied optimizers for multi-objective problems. However, to store many optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run with a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the algorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the popular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts with a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a user-specified number $\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of $\mu$. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove that the dNSGA-II with parameters $\mu \geq 4(n + 1)$ and $\tau \geq \frac{256}{50} e n$ computes the full Pareto front of the \textsc{OneMinMax} benchmark of size $n$ in $O(\log(\mu) \tau + \mu \log(n))$ function evaluations, both in expectation and with high probability. For an optimal choice of $\mu$ and $\tau$, the resulting $O(n \log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter $\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This approach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\log(n))$ compared to an optimal choice of $\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of $\Theta(n / \log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.</description>

      <title>Financial Decision Making using Reinforcement Learning with Dirichlet Priors and Quantum-Inspired Genetic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization, the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for adaptive enterprise budgeting.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator Learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii) replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the $d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient descent can achieve comparable guarantees.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Error Sources in LLM-based Hypothesis Search for Few-Shot Rule Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient systems.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling for Personalized Transcranial Electrical Stimulation: Theory, Tools, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Unnoticeable Community Deception via Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.</description>

      <title>Prediction, Generation of WWTPs microbiome community structures and Clustering of WWTPs various feature attributes using DE-BP model, SiTime-GAN model and DPNG-EPMC ensemble clustering algorithm with modulation of microbial ecosystem health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil, wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes, develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.</description>

      <title>Semantic and episodic memories in a predictive coding model of the neocortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense, overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated representations as found in the hippocampus.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Benchmarks for Model Merging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems, where information is transmitted through action potentials in a bio-plausible fashion, is gaining increasing interest due to its promise of low-power event-driven computing. Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Evolutionary Optimization on Combinatorial Problems in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization has garnered significant attention, such as in multi-task evolutionary optimization (MTEO), which aims to solve complex problems by simultaneously optimizing multiple tasks. While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.</description>

      <title>Visual Evolutionary Optimization on Graph-Structured Combinatorial Problems with MLLMs: A Case Study of Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary optimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. {Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks.} We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.</description>

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.</description>

Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms, known as metaphor-based algorithms, utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. However, a plethora of these algorithms require a more rigorous review before making them applicable to the relevant fields. This survey categorizes these algorithms into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their principles, strengths, novelty, and critical limitations. We provide a critique on the novelty issues of many of these algorithms. We illustrate some of the suitable usage of the prominent algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of reliable and authentic advancement of bio-inspired algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>AR-LIF: Adaptive reset leaky integrate-and-fire neuron for spiking neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of the (1+1)-evolution strategy on locally strongly convex functions with lipschitz continuous gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution strategy (ES) is one of the promising classes of algorithms for black-box continuous optimization. Despite its broad successes in applications, theoretical analysis on the speed of its convergence is limited on convex quadratic functions and their monotonic transformation. In this study, an upper bound and a lower bound of the rate of linear convergence of the (1+1)-ES on locally $L$-strongly convex functions with $U$-Lipschitz continuous gradient are derived as $\exp\left(-\Omega_{d\to\infty}\left(\frac{L}{d\cdot U}\right)\right)$ and $\exp\left(-\frac1d\right)$, respectively. Notably, any prior knowledge on the mathematical properties of the objective function, such as Lipschitz constant, is not given to the algorithm, whereas the existing analyses of derivative-free optimization algorithms require it.</description>

      <title>Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.</description>
