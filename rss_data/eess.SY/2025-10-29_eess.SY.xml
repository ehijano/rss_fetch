      <title>Maximal Load Shedding Verification for Neural Network Models of AC Line Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via MathOptAI.jl. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.</description>

      <title>A Simultaneous ECG-PCG Acquisition System with Real-Time Burst-Adaptive Noise Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds. However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited. Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and 30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital environments typical of resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>MDP-based Energy-aware Task Scheduling for Battery-less IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy. Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP) scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF capacitor.</description>

      <title>Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Volt-VAR Optimization for Three-Phase Unbalanced Distribution Systems with Network Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO) method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50 times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO problems under practical operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Approach to Real-Time Economic Dispatch with Multi-Transmission-Node DER Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP) represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED) framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors (DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Optimal Power Flow with Data-Driven Carbon Emission Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying locational carbon emissions in power grids is crucial for implementing effective carbon reduction strategies for customers relying on electricity. This paper presents a carbon-aware optimal power flow (OPF) framework that incorporates data-driven carbon tracing, enabling rapid estimation of nodal carbon emissions from electric loads. By developing generator-to-load carbon emission distribution factors through data-driven technique, the analytical formulas for both average and marginal carbon emissions can be derived and integrated seamlessly into DC OPF models as linear constraints. The proposed carbon-aware OPF model enables market operators to optimize energy dispatch while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Simulations on IEEE test systems confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed approach, highlighting its applicability for real-time carbon-aware system operations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Scheduling of Fusion Patterns in Autonomous Driving Systems (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication. However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in comparable scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Modeling of Temperature and Smoke Evolution in a Thermal-Runaway Event of a Large-Format Lithium-ion Battery in a Mine Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) provide effective energy storage solutions for high-power equipment used in underground mining operations. They have high Columbic efficiency and minimal heat and emission footprints. However, improper use of LIBs, accidents, or other factors may increase the probability of thermal runaway (TR), a rapid combustion reaction that discharges toxic and flammable substances. Several such incidents have been documented in mines. Since repeatable TR experiments to uncover the transient-state propagation of TR are expensive and hazardous, high-fidelity models are usually developed to mimic the impact of these events. They are resource-intensive and are impractical to develop for many scenarios that could be observed in a mine. Therefore, dynamic models within a reduced-order framework were constructed to represent the transient-state combustion event. Reduced order models (ROMs) reasonably replicate trends in temperature and smoke, showing strong alignment with the ground-truth dataset.</description>

      <title>Secure Control of Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles Under Adversarial Cyber-Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles (CAEV) is the solution to the future smart mobility having benefits of efficient traffic flow and cleaner environmental impact. Although CAEV has advantages they are still susceptible to adversarial cyber attacks due to their autonomous electric operation and the involved connectivity. To alleviate this issue, we propose a secure control architecture of CAEV. Particularly, we design an additional control input using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to be applied to the vehicle powertrain along with the input commanded by the battery. We present simulation case studies to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in keeping the CAEV platoon operating safely without collisions by curbing the effect of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Moving Horizon Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sample-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems to estimate the current system state using irregularly and/or infrequently available measurements. The cost function of the MHE optimization problem is suitably designed to accommodate these irregular output sequences. We also establish that, under a suitable sample-based detectability condition known as sample-based incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), the proposed sample-based MHE achieves robust global exponential stability (RGES). Additionally, for the case of linear systems, we draw connections between sample-based observability and sample-based i-IOSS. This demonstrates that previously established conditions for linear systems to be sample-based observable can be utilized to verify or design sampling strategies that satisfy the conditions to guarantee RGES of the sample-based MHE. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sample-based MHE is illustrated through a simulation example.</description>

      <title>A comparison between joint and dual UKF implementations for state estimation and leak localization in water distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainability of modern cities highly depends on efficient water distribution management, including effective pressure control and leak detection and localization. Accurate information about the network hydraulic state is therefore essential. This article presents a comparison between two data-driven state estimation methods based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), fusing pressure, demand and flow data for head and flow estimation. One approach uses a joint state vector with a single estimator, while the other uses a dual-estimator scheme. We analyse their main characteristics, discussing differences, advantages and limitations, and compare them theoretically in terms of accuracy and complexity. Finally, we show several estimation results for the L-TOWN benchmark, allowing to discuss their properties in a real implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential decision making under uncertainty is central to many Process Systems Engineering (PSE) challenges, where traditional methods often face limitations related to controlling and optimizing complex and stochastic systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a data-driven approach to derive control policies for such challenges. This paper presents a survey and tutorial on RL methods, tailored for the PSE community. We deliver a tutorial on RL, covering fundamental concepts and key algorithmic families including value-based, policy-based and actor-critic methods. Subsequently, we survey existing applications of these RL techniques across various PSE domains, such as in fed-batch and continuous process control, process optimization, and supply chains. We conclude with PSE focused discussion of specialized techniques and emerging directions. By synthesizing the current state of RL algorithm development and implications for PSE this work identifies successes, challenges, trends, and outlines avenues for future research at the interface of these fields.</description>

      <title>Mechanism-Guided Residual Lifting and Control Consistent Modeling for Pneumatic Drying Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumatic drying processes in industries such as agriculture, chemicals,and pharmaceuticals are notoriously difficult to model and control due to multi-source disturbances,coupled stage dynamics, and significant measurement delays. Traditional modeling paradigms often fail to simultaneously deliver accuracy, interpretability, and closed-loop applicability. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a unified hybrid modeling framework, termed Physics-Guided Residual Lifting with Control-Consistent Correction,which integrates a transient mechanistic model with a stability-constrained data-driven component. The framework covers the complete process chain of drying, transport, and winnowing. On the mechanistic level, the model unifies mass transfer dynamics using the partial pressure difference of water vapor, incorporates water activity clamping and latent heat corrections for bound water, and ensures energy closure with moisture-dependent specific heat. On the data-driven level,we propose an orthogonal residual learning scheme. It leverages intermediate states from the mechanistic model as proxy variables to construct a physics-inspired dictionary, preventing parameter compensation and overfitting during ridge regression. Furthermore, to ensure suitability for predictive control, a Control-Consistent Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with stability constraints is employed to learn the residual dynamics, for which we provide boundedness proofs and stability guarantees. The framework was validated on 10 industrial batches, comprising 63,000 samples. On unseen test data, the hybrid model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 0.016% for outlet moisture and 0.015 {\deg}C for outlet temperature, with values improving to 0.986 and 0.995, respectively. The resulting prediction residuals exhibit white-noise characteristics, with significantly reduced spectral energy at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Development of a Digital Twin for an Electric Vehicle Emulator Modeling, Control, and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a scaled-down electric vehicle (EV) emulator, designed to replicate longitudinal vehicle dynamics under diverse operating conditions. The emulator integrates a separately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery emulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort, aerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton's second law. In contrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and bond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework offers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and facilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control strategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the powertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation. Experimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong correlation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to compute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a 180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope constraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter ensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design, and energy management validation.</description>

Abstract: Neural-network-based controllers (NNCs) can represent complex, highly nonlinear control laws, but verifying the closed-loop stability of dynamical systems using them remains challenging. This work presents contributions to a state-of-the-art stability verification procedure for NNC-controlled systems which relies on semialgebraic-set-based input-output modeling to pose the search for a Lyapunov function as an optimization problem. Specifically, this procedure's conservatism when analyzing NNCs using transcendental activation functions and the restriction to feedforward NNCs are addressed by a) introducing novel semialgebraic activation functions that preserve key properties of common transcendental activations and b) proving compatibility of NNCs from the broader class of recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) with this procedure. Furthermore, the indirect optimization of a local region of attraction (RoA) estimate using a restricted set of candidate Lyapunov functions is greatly improved via c) the introduction of a richer parameterization of candidate Lyapunov functions than previously reported and d) the formulation of novel semidefinite programs (SDPs) that directly optimize the resulting RoA estimate. The value of these contributions is highlighted in two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Parametric Oscillator Ising Machines through the Kuramoto Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators are emerging as powerful physical platforms for implementing Ising machines. Yet the relationship between parametric-oscillator implementations and traditional oscillator-based Ising machines remains underexplored. In this work, we develop a Kuramoto-style, canonical phase description of parametric oscillator Ising machines by starting from the Stuart-Landau oscillator model- the canonical normal form near a Hopf bifurcation, and a natural reduced description for many parametric oscillator implementations such as the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) among others. The resulting phase dynamics combine the usual phase-difference coupling observed in the standard Kuramoto model along with an intrinsic phase sum term that is generated when conjugate coupling is considered. Moreover, our formulation helps explain why explicit second-harmonic driving is unnecessary in parametric oscillators and also reveals how quasi-steady amplitude heterogeneity scales the original strength of the spin interaction with potentially adverse impacts on the solution quality. Our work helps develop a unifying view of the oscillator-based approach to designing Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Switching Network System Identification via Convex Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a convex optimization framework for identifying switched network systems, in which both the node dynamics and the underlying graph topology switch between a finite number of configurations. Building on our recent convex identification method for general switching systems, we extend the formulation to structured network systems where each mode corresponds to a distinct adjacency matrix. We show that both the continuous node dynamics and binary network topologies can be identified from sampled state-velocity data by solving a sequence of convex programs. The proposed framework provides a unified and scalable way to recover piecewise network structures from data without a prior knowledge of mode labels at each state. Numerical results on diffusively coupled oscillators demonstrate accurate recovery of both mode dynamics and switching graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.</description>

      <title>An N-of-1 Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for Precision Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.</description>

      <title>Flatness-based trajectory planning for 3D overhead cranes with friction compensation and collision avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point. A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and safe crane trajectories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Reconfiguration by Randomized Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that efficiently computes nearly-optimal solutions to a class of combinatorial reconfiguration problems on weighted, undirected graphs. Inspired by societally relevant applications in networked infrastructure systems, these problems consist of simultaneously finding an unreweighted sparsified graph and nodal potentials that satisfy fixed demands, where the objective is to minimize some congestion criterion, e.g., a Laplacian quadratic form. These are mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems that are NP-hard in general. To circumvent these challenges, instead of solving for a single best configuration, the proposed randomized switching algorithm seeks to design a distribution of configurations that, when sampled, ensures that congestion concentrates around its optimum. We show that the proposed congestion metric is a generalized self-concordant function in the space of switching probabilities, which enables the use of efficient and simple conditional gradient methods. We implement our algorithm and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) solver by orders of magnitude over a large range of problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drive Safely with Hybrid Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore, in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies over actions.</description>

      <title>Feature Matching-Based Gait Phase Prediction for Obstacle Crossing Control of Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor, ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression. Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz, with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Computing for Data Centers with Probabilistic Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers are significant contributors to carbon emissions and can strain power systems due to their high electricity consumption. To mitigate this impact and to participate in demand response programs, cloud computing companies strive to balance and optimize operations across their global fleets by making strategic decisions about when and where to place compute jobs for execution. In this paper, we introduce a load shaping scheme which reacts to time-varying grid signals by leveraging both temporal and spatial flexibility of compute jobs to provide risk-aware management guidelines and job placement with provable performance guarantees based on distributionally robust optimization. Our approach divides the problem into two key components: (i) day-ahead planning, which generates an optimal scheduling strategy based on historical load data, and (ii) real-time job placement and (time) scheduling, which dynamically tracks the optimal strategy generated in (i). We validate our method in simulation using normalized load profiles from randomly selected Google clusters, incorporating time-varying grid signals. We can demonstrate significant reductions in carbon cost and peak power with our approach compared to myopic greedy policies, while maintaining computational efficiency and abiding to system and grid constraints.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</description>

      <title>A Volumetric Privacy Measure for Dynamical Systems With Bounded Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02893v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present a volumetric privacy measure for dynamical systems with bounded disturbances, wherein the states of the system contain private information and an adversary with access to sensor measurements attempts to infer the set of potential values of the private information. Under the proposed privacy measure, the volume of the uncertainty set of the adversary given the sensor measurements is considered as the privacy level of the system. We next characteristic the time evolution of the proposed privacy measure and study its properties for a particular system with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that the uncertainty reduction of the adversary is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Fairness of the Variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) problems are commonly used to model strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are coupled in cost and constraints. Specifically, the variational GNE, a refinement of the GNE, is often selected as the solution concept due to its non-discriminatory treatment of agents by charging a uniform ``shadow price" for shared resources. We study the fairness concept of v-GNEs from a comparability perspective and show that it makes an implicit assumption of unit comparability of agent's cost functions, one of the strongest comparability notions. Further, we introduce a new solution concept, f-GNE in which a fairness metric is chosen a priori which is compatible with the comparability at hand. We introduce an electric vehicle charging game to demonstrate the fragility of v-GNE fairness and compare it to the f-GNE under various fairness metrics.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</description>

      <title>Flight-Ready Precise and Robust Carrier-Phase GNSS Navigation Software for Distributed Space Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.</description>

Abstract: The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.</description>

      <title>NeuroDOB: A Deep Neural Observer-Based Controller for Vehicle Lateral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23067</link>

Abstract: This paper proposes NeuroDOB, a deep neural network based observer controller for vehicle lateral dynamics, which replaces the conventional disturbance observer (DOB) with a deep neural network (DNN) to enhance personalized lateral control. Unlike conventional DOBs that compensate for general disturbances such as road friction variation and crosswind, NeuroDOB explicitly addresses unmodeled vehicle dynamics and driver-specific behaviors by learning the steering compensation signal from driver-in-the-loop simulations using CarSim's embedded controller as a surrogate driver. The proposed architecture integrates NeuroDOB with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), where the DNN outputs a delta error correction added to the baseline LQR steering input to produce the final control command. Input features to the DNN include lateral position and yaw angle errors, and the LQR control input. Experimental validation using a lateral dynamic bicycle model within CarSim demonstrates that NeuroDOB effectively adapts to individual driving habits, improving lateral control performance beyond what conventional LQR controllers achieve. The results indicate the potential of deep neural network based observer to enable personalized and adaptive autonomous vehicle control. In cognitive terms, the proposed architecture can be viewed as a dual-system control structure. The baseline LQR corresponds to System 1, a model-based, fast, and analytic reasoning layer ensuring stability. The NeuroDOB acts as System 2, a reflective, data-driven layer that learns compensation from experience and corrects the analytical bias of System 1. Together, they form an integrated decision process analogous to human intuition-reflection interaction, enabling both stability and adaptability in lateral control.</description>

      <title>A cutting-surface consensus approach for distributed robust optimization of multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel and fully distributed optimization method is proposed for the distributed robust convex program (DRCP) over a time-varying unbalanced directed network under the uniformly jointly strongly connected (UJSC) assumption. Firstly, an approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints to ensure tractability and restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a positive parameter to ensure a feasible solution for (DRCP) can be obtained. This problem is iteratively solved by a distributed projected gradient algorithm proposed in this paper, which is based on epigraphic reformulation and gradient projected operations. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with guaranteed local feasibility for each agent. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand constraints and adding the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time termination of the distributed optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on consensus and zeroth-order stopping conditions under UJSC graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus approach terminates finitely and yields a feasible and approximate optimal solution for each agent. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Learning of Stabilizing Neural Controllers via Zubov Sampling and Iterative Domain Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimates of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms. Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much conservatism remains in their frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize a controller and a Lyapunov function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we propose a novel training-data sampling strategy and a domain-updating mechanism that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10{,}000$ times faster compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal.

      <title>MathBode: Understanding LLM Reasoning with Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48-62% in sparse topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable, per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible, and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1% of theoretical optima.</description>
