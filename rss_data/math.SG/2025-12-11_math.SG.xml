      <title>Hill's Lunar Equations, Series, Convergence, Motion of the Perigee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Hill's lunar equations, series and the motion of the perigee, and we use computers to go farther than has previously been known, calculating the coefficients of Hill's series up to order 24 in m, and the coefficients that do not depend on a_0 up to order 30. Numerical calculations indicate that the radius of convergence of Hill's series is somewhere near the value of m of the cusped orbit (0.560958), which we formulate as a conjecture. We calculate the motion of the perigee using a linearization of the equation for the anomalistic period, as in Hill's documentation, but with some discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Equiaffine immersions and pseudo-Riemannian space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an explicit construction that produces immersions into the pseudosphere $\mathbb{S}^{n,n+1}$ and the pseudohyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ starting from equiaffine immersions in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and conversely. We describe how these immersions interact with a para-Sasaki metric defined on $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ via a principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure over a para-K\"ahler manifold. In the case where the immersion in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is an $n$-dimensional hyperbolic affine sphere, we obtain spacelike maximal immersions in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ that satisfy a transversality condition with respect to the principal $\mathbb{R}$-bundle structure. As a first application, we show that, given a certain boundary set $\Lambda_\Omega \subset \partial_\infty \mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$, associated with a properly convex subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{RP}^n$ and homeomorphic to an $(n-1)$-sphere, there exists an $n$-dimensional maximal spacelike submanifold in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1,n}$ whose boundary is precisely $\Lambda_\Omega$. As a second application, we show that the Blaschke lift of the hyperbolic affine sphere, introduced by Labourie for $n=2$, into the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{R})$ is a harmonic map.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology from the Floer theory of $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13026v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology via Morse-Bott-Floer Spectral Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences, we describe a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. Our spectral sequences give explicit descriptions of birth-death phenomena of the barcode of the persistence module associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This paper contains the foundational work to rigorously construct a filtration on Floer complexes from the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, announced in our earlier paper. A substantial appendix on Morse-Bott-Floer theory deals with several of the technical difficulties of the paper. We compute a plethora of explicit examples, each highlighting various features, for Springer resolutions, ADE resolutions, and several Slodowy varieties of type A. We also consider certain Higgs moduli spaces, for which we compare our filtration with the famous P=W filtration.</description>

      <title>Weinstein exactness of nearby Lagrangians and related questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the following problem: if a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism maps a Lagrangian submanifold $L$ to a small Weinstein neighborhood of $L$, is the image necessarily Hamiltonian isotopic to $L$ inside that neighborhood? On the one hand, we show that the question can have a negative answer in any symplectic manifold of dimension at least six. On the other hand, we answer an a priori weaker form of the question in the positive in various cases when $L$ satisfies a rationality condition: we prove that the image of $L$ is often exact inside the Weinstein neighborhood. We provide applications to the Lagrangian counterpart of the $C^0$ flux conjecture, to $C^0$-rigidity phenomena of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, and to topological properties of spaces of Lagrangians with the same rationality constraint. Moreover, we state and prove cases of an analogue of Viterbo's spectral norm conjecture for non-exact Lagrangians; in the process, we make progress on an old question of Viterbo regarding integer difference vectors between points of Lagrangians.</description>
