      <title>Recent results from NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS is a multipurpose fixed-target spectrometer for charged and neutral hadron measurements. Its research program includes studies of strong interactions as well as reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. A significant advantage of NA61/SHINE over collider experiments is its extended coverage of phase space available for hadron production. This includes the nearly entire forward hemisphere for charged hadrons and additionally, a large part of the backward hemisphere for specific neutrals. This paper summarizes a selected set of new results, obtained by NA61/SHINE since the last SQM conference (Busan, 2022). Particular attention is devoted to (1) the first-ever direct measurement of open charm production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS energies (2) the difference observed between charged and neutral meson production in Ar+Sc reactions, up to now not understood by existing models, and (3) the importance of baseline effects in the search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>$K^*/K$ ratio and the time between freeze-outs for intermediate-mass Ar+Sc system at the SPS energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance production is one of the key observables to study the dynamics of high-energy collisions. In dense systems created in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions, the properties of some of them (widths, masses, branching ratios) were predicted to be modified due to partial restoration of chiral symmetry. The resonance spectra and yields are also important inputs for Blast-Wave and Hadron Resonance Gas models. Finally, the analysis of strange $K^*(892)^0$ resonance allows us to better understand the time evolution of high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision. Namely, the ratio of $K^*(892)^0$ to charged kaons is used to determine the time between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs.
  In this article, the first results on the analysis of $K^*(892)^0$ production in central Ar+Sc collisions at three SPS energies ($\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 8.8, 11.9, 16.8 GeV) are presented. The $K^*(892)^0/K^{+/-}$ yield ratios are compared with corresponding results in $p$+$p$ collisions, allowing us to estimate the time between chemical and thermal freeze-outs in Ar+Sc collisions. These first results for intermediate-mass nucleus-nucleus systems at the SPS energy range are compared with the results of heavier systems at a similar energy range.</description>

      <title>Assessing the QGP speed of sound in ultra-central heavy-ion collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions produce a state of hot, dense, strongly interacting QCD matter known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). On an event-by-event basis, the volume of the QGP in ultra-central collisions is mostly constant, while its total entropy can vary significantly, leading to variations in the temperature of the system. Exploiting this unique feature of ultra-central collisions allows us to interpret the correlation between the mean transverse momentum $(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \rangle)$ of produced charged hadrons and the number of charged hadrons as a measure of the the speed of sound, $c_{s}$. The speed of sound, $c_{s}$, which relates to the speed at which compression waves travel in a medium (in this case the QGP), is determined by fitting the relative increase of $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \rangle$ with respect to the relative change of the average charged-particle density $(\langle \mathrm{d}N_{\mathrm{ch}}/ \mathrm{d}\eta \rangle)$ measured at midrapidity. This study reports the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}} \rangle$ of charged particles in ultra-central Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair, using the ALICE detector. Different centrality estimators based on charged-particle multiplicity or the transverse energy of the event are employed to select ultra-central collisions. By ensuring a pseudorapidity gap between the region used to define the centrality and the region used for measurement, the influence of biases and their potential effects on the rise of the mean transverse momentum are tested. The measured $c_{s}^{2}$ is found to strongly depend on the type of the centrality estimator, ranging from $0.113 \pm 0.003 \, \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.007 \, \mathrm{(syst)}$ to $0.438 \pm 0.001 \, \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.019 \, \mathrm{(syst)}$ in natural units.</description>

      <title>Probing Nuclear Structure of Heavy Ions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform high-statistics simulations to study the impacts of nuclear structure on the ratios of anisotropic flow observables in $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Even with $40\%$ difference in atomic numbers between $^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe nuclei, the ratios of anisotropic flow in the same centrality class between the two collision systems are strongly affected by the nuclear structure inputs in the initial state. The ratios of $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ in these collisions are sensitive to the nuclear skin thickness of the colliding nuclei, providing indirect constraints on the nuclei's neutron skin. Our model predictions serve as a benchmark to compare with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Athermal phonon collection efficiency in diamond crystals for low mass dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of lab-grown diamonds as potential target materials for the direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter~(DM) using metallic magnetic calorimeters~(MMCs). Diamond, with its excellent phononic properties and the low atomic mass of the constituent carbon, can play a crucial role in detecting low-mass dark matter particles. The relatively long electron-hole pair lifetime inside the crystal may provide discrimination power between the DM-induced nuclear recoil events and the background-induced electron recoil events. Utilizing the the fast response times of the MMCs and their unique geometric versatility, we deployed a novel methodology for quantifying phonon dynamics inside diamond crystals. We demonstrated that lab-grown diamond crystals fabricated via the chemical vapor deposition~(CVD) technique can satisfy the stringent quality requirements for sub-GeV dark matter searches. The high-quality polycrystalline CVD diamond showed a superior athermal phonon collection efficiency compared to that of the reference sapphire crystal, and achieved energy resolution 62.7~eV at the 8.05~keV copper fluorescence line. With this energy resolution, we explored the low-energy range below 100~eV and confirmed the existence of so-called low-energy excess~(LEE) reported by multiple cryogenic experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Diversity of Nuclear Density through Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the role of information entropy in understanding nuclear density distributions, including both stable configurations and non-traditional structures such as neutron halos and $\alpha$-clustering. By quantifying the uncertainty and disorder inherent in nucleon distributions in nuclear many-body systems, information entropy provides a macroscopic measure of the physical properties of the system. A more dispersed and disordered density distribution results in a higher value of information entropy. This intrinsic relationship between information entropy and system complexity allows us to quantify uncertainty and disorder in nuclear structures by analyzing various geometric parameters such as nuclear radius, diffuseness, neutron skin, and cluster structural features.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity and factorial moment scaling in the symmetry broken phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for remnants of the QCD chiral critical point is a central objective of current and future high-energy ion collision experiments. Previous studies suggest that a scaling law relating higher-order factorial moments of hadron multiplicity fluctuations to the second factorial moment could serve as a tool for detecting the QCD critical point. However, we demonstrate that this scaling law is not unique to critical phenomena. Instead, it emerges as a general property of distributions by extending the concept of hypercontractivity, originally applied to ordinary moments, to factorial moments. We present examples of distribution classes that exhibit the same higher-order factorial moment scaling as multiplicity fluctuations in the symmetry-broken phase. This insight allows us to explain the recent intermittency analysis results from the STAR experiment at RHIC (arXiv:2301.11062), where no indication of criticality was observed.</description>

      <title>SMASH as an event generator for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present an overview of the SMASH hadronic transport approach that is applied for non-equilibrium dynamics of hadrons in \heavyion\ collisions. We will give an overview about the ingredients of the approach and the applications for the dynamical description of \heavyion\ collisions and for calculations of fundamental properties of the hadron gas. The main emphasis of the article will be the infrastructure for sustainable software development that we have developed over the last 10 years including extensive unit tests and continuous integration. We will also provide one section about the performance of the code and how it can be analyzed and improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Complete 1-loop study of exclusive $ J/\psi $ and $ \Upsilon $ photoproduction with full GPD evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the exclusive photoproduction of a heavy vector quarkonium, namely $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ at 1-loop in $\alpha_s$. In collinear factorisation (CF), the amplitude for such a process is obtained by the convolution of a hard partonic sub-amplitude, with a universal generalised parton distribution (GPD). For the first time, we perform a complete calculation at 1-loop including full leading-log (LL) GPD evolution. We first demonstrate the huge instability of the cross section at high energies when the factorisation scale $\mu_F$ is varied. This instability has been reported previously in the literature, and occurs due to the large logarithms generated by the huge difference between the hard scale of the process, which is the mass of the heavy quarkonium here, and the centre-of-mass energy of the process. This problem was also reported in inclusive heavy vector quarkonium photoproduction. We show that this issue can be resolved by resumming these large logarithms using high-energy factorisation (HEF), by performing a matching with the result in CF using the doubly logarithmic approximation (DLA) in order to be consistent with the fixed order evolution of GPDs. Finally, we show that the cross sections obtained from such a matching, besides being free from the previously mentioned factorisation scale variation instabilities, are consistent with the H1 data for $J/\psi$ production and with the ZEUS data for $\Upsilon$ production.</description>

      <title>Clocking the particle production and tracking of strangeness balance and radial flow effects at top LHC energy with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balance functions have been used extensively to elucidate the time evolution of quark production in heavy-ion collisions. Early models predicted two stages of quark production, one for light quarks and one for the heavier strange quark, separated by a period of isentropic expansion. This led to the notion of clocking particle production and tracking radial flow effects, which drive the expansion of the system. In this talk, balance functions of identified particles in different multiplicity classes of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\;\text{TeV}$ recorded by ALICE during the LHC Run 3 are reported. The results are compared with different models as well as with previously published results on pp and Pb--Pb collisions at different energies. The results enable tracking the balancing of electric charge and strangeness by measuring how the widths and integrals of the charge and strangeness balance functions evolve across different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>A Kalman Filter for track reconstruction in very large time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Kalman Filter tailored for homogeneous gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), adapted from the algorithm utilized by the ALICE experiment. In order to describe semi-circular paths in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, we introduce a novel mirror rotation technique into the Kalman Filter algorithm, enabling effective tracking of trajectories of varying lengths, including those with multiple circular paths within the detector, also known as "loopers". Demonstrated relative improvements of up to 80% in electron momentum resolution and up to 50% in muon and pion momentum resolution underscore the significance of this enhancement. Significant improvements in the reconstruction efficiency for relatively short low momentum "looper" tracks are also shown. Such advancements hold promise not only for the future of the ALICE TPC but also for neutrino high-pressure gas TPCs, where loopers become significant owing to the randomness of production points and their relatively low energies in neutrino interactions. In particular, an improvement in low energy electron reconstruction, for which the production of "looping" tracks is likely and the impact of the new algorithm is directly demonstrated, could significantly impact the quality of flux determination, which in accelerator neutrino experiments relies on the measurement of $\nu_e$ electron scatterings.</description>

      <title>Data Reduction for Low Energy Nuclear Physics Experiments Using Data Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low energy nuclear physics experiments are transitioning towards fully digital data acquisition systems. Realizing the gains in flexibility afforded by these systems relies on equally flexible data reduction techniques. In this paper, methods utilizing data frames and in-memory techniques to work with data, including data from self-triggering, digital data acquisition systems, are discussed within the context of a Python package, \texttt{sauce}. It is shown that data frame operations can encompass common analysis needs and allow interactive data analysis. Two event building techniques, dubbed referenced and referenceless event building, are shown to provide a means to transform raw list mode data into correlated multi-detector events. These techniques are demonstrated in the analysis of two example data sets.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulation of Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions at Intermediate Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of new techniques in machine learning are speeding up progress in research in various fields. In this work, we construct and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) to be used within a Bayesian statistical framework as a faster and more reliable alternative to the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator of an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate beam energies. We found strong evidence of DNN being able to emulate the IBUU simulator's prediction on the strengths of protons' directed and elliptical flow very efficiently even with small training datasets and with accuracy about ten times higher than the GP. Limitations of our present work and future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dense matter equation of state with new NICER mass-radius measurements and new chiral effective field theory inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulse profile modeling of X-ray data from NICER is now enabling precision inference of neutron star mass and radius. Combined with nuclear physics constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), and masses and tidal deformabilities inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, this has lead to a steady improvement in our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS). Here we consider the impact of several new results: the radius measurement for the 1.42$\,M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 presented by Choudhury et al. (2024), updates to the masses and radii of PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, and new $\chi$EFT results for neutron star matter up to 1.5 times nuclear saturation density. Using two different high-density EOS extensions -- a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS) -- we find the radius of a 1.4$\,M_\odot$ (2.0$\,M_\odot$) neutron star to be constrained to the 95% credible ranges $12.28^{+0.50}_{-0.76}\,$km ($12.33^{+0.70}_{-1.34}\,$km) for the PP model and $12.01^{+0.56}_{-0.75}\,$km ($11.55^{+0.94}_{-1.09}\,$km) for the CS model. The maximum neutron star mass is predicted to be $2.15^{+0.14}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ and $2.08^{+0.28}_{-0.16}\,$$M_\odot$ for the PP and CS model, respectively. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different orders and different densities up to which $\chi$EFT is used, and show how the astrophysical observations provide constraints for the pressure at intermediate densities. Moreover, we investigate the difference $R_{2.0} - R_{1.4}$ of the radius of 2$\,M_\odot$ and 1.4$\,M_\odot$ neutron stars within our EOS inference.</description>

      <title>Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance Mass Spectrometry with the Canadian Penning Trap at CARIBU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer (CPT) has conducted precision mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides from the CAlifornia Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) of the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) facility at Argonne National Laboratory using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) technique for over half a decade. Here we discuss the CPT system, and methods to improve accuracy and precision in mass measurement using PI-ICR including some optimization techniques and recently studied systematic effects.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation of the absence of the spherical nuclei with the hidden-color states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to the simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the whole nucleus should have many hidden-color states, and the quark-gluon degrees of freedom are required even at the low-energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
