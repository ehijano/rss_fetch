      <title>Charged Particle Resonance In Induction Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from First Principles, the space charge manipulation of charged particles in an induction field in free space based on an unique Magnetic field strength and its oscillation Frequency relationship is demonstrated numerically and theoretically. The Larmor precession frequency for a time varying magnetic field, instead of conventionally followed static magnetic field is derived for the first time. With the dispersion relation in Ion Resonance depending on its frequency of gyration, an AC driven electromagnet based particle resonance has been proposed circumventing the use of Superconducting Permanent Magnets. Complete resonance achieved under the proposed conditions results in a sustained, fixed-frequency particle trajectory that is independent of its speed or drift. Such oscillation is visualized in a D-Shaped Resonant assembly. The amplitude and the wavelength calculations for the trajectory are demonstrated analytically. Principally noting the objectives of Synchrotron in varying the magnetic field and its frequency to generate high energy particles, the present theory addresses the same. Its applications can be explored in Space Propulsion Systems, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and sub-harmonic heating and cooling. Using this theory one can aptly generate RF Power using device specific designed resonant antennas coupling it with with Plasma.</description>
