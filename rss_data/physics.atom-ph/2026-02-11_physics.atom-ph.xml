      <title>Charge Exchange Dynamics in Cold Collisions of $^{40}$CaH$^+$ and $^{39}$K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of charge-exchange collisions between trapped calcium monohydride molecular ions ($^{40}$CaH$^+$) and ultracold potassium atoms ($^{39}$K) in a hybrid ion-atom trap. The measured charge-exchange rate coefficient is significantly suppressed relative to the Langevin rate constant for the system. We use quantum-chemical calculations to model the (CaH-K)$^+$ system in the ground and excited electronic states and to identify possible charge-exchange mechanisms. Our calculations do not fully explain the measured rate, highlighting the need for a full-dimensional quantum treatment that includes vibrational motion and intermediate complex formation. Our work demonstrates that cold hybrid ion-atom platforms with molecular ions enable access to richer chemical complexity and collisional dynamics inaccessible in purely atomic systems.</description>

      <title>A narrow-linewidth Brillouin laser for a two-photon rubidium frequency standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision portable and deployable frequency standards are required for modern navigation and communication technologies. Optical frequency standards are attractive for their improved stability over their microwave counterparts; however, increased complexities have anchored them in the laboratory. Sacrificing sensitivity of the most stable optical clocks has led to the recent development of deployable and portable optical frequency standards, leveraging hot atomic or molecular vapor. The short term limit for a majority of previous reports on two-photon rubidium standards is either the shot-noise or intermodulation limit hindering the one second fractional frequency stability to around $1\times10^{-13}/\sqrt{\tau}$. The answer for the shot-noise limit is to increase optical power and collected fluorescence, while the intermodulation limit solution requires improvements in laser linewidth, stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers are known to reduce frequency noise, suppressing noise of the pump laser at high ofset frequencies. We investigate an optical frequency standard based on the two-photon transition in $^{87}$Rb probed with a narrow linewidth photonic integrated circuit SBS laser with a quality factor over 130 million and instantaneous linewidth $&lt;$ 10 Hz. The use of a narrow linewidth clock laser coupled with operating at higher optical intensities yields clock instabilities of $2\times10^{-14}$ at one second, currently the best reported short-term stability for a two-photon rubidium optical frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Simple Magneto-Optical and Magnetic Traps for Dysprosium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysprosium (Dy) is the most magnetic element on the periodic table, making it excellent for studying dipolar atom-atom interactions. We report on a simple Dy MOT that captures atoms directly from the thermal beam using a single diode-laser system to generate the light. Additionally, the atoms are magnetically confined by the quadrupole magnetic field that also facilitates the MOT. The MOT loading time is $\tau_\text{b} = 26~\text{ms}$. Atoms can decay to a dark state that is magnetically trapped. The time constant for loading into this magnetic trap is $\tau_\text{d} = 410~\text{ms}$. The total magnetically trapped population is $1.14\times10^{5}$ atoms, with $85\%$ residing in the dark states. The magnetically trapped atoms have a temperature of $28~\mu\text{K}$, significantly below the Doppler limit. This population fulfills the requirements for a range of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing Exotic Electron-Electron Interactions with the Helium Ionization-Energy Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision atomic spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. A recently reported $9\sigma$ theory-experiment discrepancy in the ionization energy of metastable helium has motivated the hypothesis of a new boson mediating exotic electron-electron interactions. Using a model-independent sign-consistency analysis of the induced energy shifts, we show that the sign requirement alone excludes vector-vector and pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar interactions as possible explanations of the anomaly. Incorporating existing constraints together with improved limits obtained here further excludes axial-vector scenarios. Within the single-boson framework considered in this work, only a narrowly constrained scalar-mediated interaction remains viable. The remaining parameter space could be probed, for example, by modest improvements in the determination of the electron gyromagnetic ratio.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of atomic number density in MEMS vapor cells via single-pass absorption spectroscopy (SPAS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based chip-scale alkali vapor cells are the essential components in emerging quantum technologies, including compact atomic clocks, chip-scale magnetometers, and miniature quantum opto-electronic systems. The sensitivity of MEMS-based atomic quantum technology devices depends on the atomic number density. Thus, it is important to have an accurate estimate of the atomic number density in chip-scale alkali vapor cells to optimize light-matter interactions and design efficient quantum sensing systems. Here, we present a direct and quantitatively validated method for determining the rubidium (Rb) number density in warm alkali vapor using single-pass absorption spectroscopy (SPAS). The absolute transmission spectra are measured and modeled using the 780.24~nm as well as the 420.29~nm transition in a Rb-filled MEMS vapor cell. The atomic number density measurements and the model were also validated using a commercial vapor cell of length 100~mm. The theoretical model employs a density-matrix formalism within the Lindblad framework and incorporates directly measurable experimental parameters, such as laser beam power, diameter, and cell temperature. The model explicitly accounts for optical pumping, Doppler broadening, and transit-time broadening effects and exhibits quantitative agreement ($&gt; 99\%$) with experimental spectra over a broad range of temperatures (293--343~K), laser intensities ($\sim0.2\, I_{\mathrm{sat}}$ to $\sim2\, I_{\mathrm{sat}}$), and cell lengths (2--100~mm). The extracted densities from the MEMS cell closely follow the empirical vapor-pressure model by Alcock et al. The demonstrated methodology provides a practical, well-controlled method for determining the atomic number density in alkali vapor cells relevant to the characterization and development of compact alkali-vapor-based devices for quantum sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary control of the temporal waveform of photons during spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control of the temporal waveform of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimization of quantum state transfer protocols and mitigation of effects due interferometric instability for network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any excited state lifetime, limited only by the timing resolution of control hardware. We show how the temporal waveform of photons can be controlled by deterministically varying the population of an excited state which undergoes spontaneous emission. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate quantum emitter: modulation of the (1) amplitude and (2) relative phase of a field coupling a ground state to the excited manifold. We detail how to identify optimal excitation pulses by employing variational algorithms to feed back on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine photon-number statistics and establish techniques to identify optimal excitation strengths and post-selection thresholds for photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure, and can be readily applied across a wide range of quantum emitters. We discuss the applications and limits of this technique, including how increasing photon emission probabilities affects achievable temporal-mode overlap fidelities between emitted and target photon waveforms.</description>

      <title>From equivalent Lagrangians to inequivalent open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to inequivalent reduced dynamics. While these Lagrangians are connected via unitary transformations at the level of the global system-plus-environment description, the equivalence breaks down after tracing out the environment. We argue that only those Lagrangians for which the canonical and mechanical momenta of the system coincide lead to operationally meaningful dynamics. Applying this insight to quantum electrodynamics (QED), we derive the master equation for bremsstrahlung due to an accelerated non-relativistic electron upto second order in the interaction. The resulting reduced dynamics predicts decoherence in the position basis and closely matches the Caldeira-Leggett form, thus resolving previous discrepancies in the literature. Our findings have implications for both QED and gravitational decoherence, where similar ambiguities arise.</description>
