      <title>Optical feedback induced irregular and chaotic dynamics in terahertz quantum cascade laser combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C&lt;1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1&lt;C&lt;2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4&lt;C&lt;13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C&gt;13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (&gt;1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Control and Automation Framework for Acousto-Holographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual operation of microscopes for repetitive tasks in cell biology is a significant bottleneck, consuming invaluable expert time, and introducing human error. Automation is essential, and while Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) offers powerful, label-free quantitative phase imaging (QPI), its inherently noisy and low-contrast holograms make robust autofocus and object detection challenging. We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Multi-peak vector soliton families in defocusing Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of multi-peaked vector soliton families in normally dispersive passive Kerr resonators. Through cross-phase modulation between two orthogonal polarization components, each peak becomes tightly interlocked, enabling robust localization of the entire wave packet in defocusing cavities. Analysis using snakes-and-ladder diagrams demonstrates the diversity of these vector soliton families, which include dark-bright multi-peak solitons, flat-topped solitons, and modulation instability patterns, among others. Furthermore, stability analysis based on the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations reveals that specific combinations of parameters can sustain stable vector cavity solitons, whose peak numbers can be continuously tuned by adding appropriate perturbations. These findings significantly expand the scope of soliton dynamics and optical frequency comb generation in pumped-dissipative systems, independent of dispersion conditions.</description>

      <title>Photonic time stretch fieldoscopy: single-shot electric field detection at near-petahertz bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the electric field of light with petahertz bandwidths in ambient air is a rapidly advancing frontier, essential for probing ultrafast dynamics driven by classical or quantum ultrashort pulses. Near-petahertz fieldoscopy has recently demonstrated sub-cycle access to light-matter interactions, enabling label-free spectro-microscopy of liquids and solids with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, detection sensitivity, and dynamic range. However, current implementations still rely on temporal scanning and averaging over many laser pulses. Here, we introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens enables the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. The resulting large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution allow direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples. This concept opens new avenues for petahertz electronics, ultrafast spectro-microscopy, and the study of dynamic, non-repetitive optical phenomena</description>

      <title>Tailoring the morphology of ultrathin bismuth films around percolation for thickness-optimized optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth films (&lt;10 nm) are emerging candidates for advanced applications in photonics. It has been shown that Bi-based subwavelength optical cavities show outstanding features, including broad tuneable resonances for structural color generation and broadband perfect absorption for light harvesting. While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\varepsilon$= $\varepsilon_1$+i$\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\varepsilon_2$ is reduced. We showcase the relevance of such dielectric tunability for the design of enhanced subwavelength optical cavities operating in the NIR and visible regions. In particular, we show that discontinuous near-percolation films enable designing optimized cavities for efficient colour generation with a thickness almost 3 times smaller than what was previously achieved for continuous films.</description>

      <title>Terahertz emission from interdigitated photoconductive antennas based on Ge-on-Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interdigitated photoconductive antenna (i-PCA) for terahertz (THz) emission with a novel metal-insulator-semiconductor interface is designed with the aim of developing compact and scalable THz devices. The photoconductive material is an amorphous germanium (Ge) film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. The antenna electrodes are composed of gold-germanium (AuGe). With the integration of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer that acts as an electrical mask on alternate active areas, we present a simple approach to fabricate a large-area i-PCA. Along with a simplified fabrication compared to other existing designs, our approach increases the electrical robustness of the emitter and reduces the inactive gap area on the device. The i-PCA is capable of THz emission up to 2.5 THz and 36 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is promising for applications in CMOS technologies.</description>

      <title>Errors in PDH offset locking due to spurious spectral features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is widely used to stabilize the frequency of lasers. Here we report on a routinely underestimated source of error in PDH offset-locking: a shift in the lock point due to the unintended interaction between residual optical sidebands and higher-order spatial modes in misaligned Fabry-Perot cavities. Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude. Our findings draw attention to a systematic effect of importance to precision optical spectroscopy, optical clocks, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Passive Silicon Nitride On-Chip Polarimetry: Precise Polarization Detection with Imperfect Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that carries distinct and valuable information. Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Negative Index Makes a Perfect Time-Domain Lens, Generating Slow Playback of Ultrafast Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of incorporating negative index materials into the physics of time-varying media and find that changing the refractive index from positive to negative creates a perfect time-reversed wave: a perfect time-domain lens. Unlike other mechanisms of phase conjugation, the perfect time-domain lens time-reverses both the propagating waves and the evanescent part of the spectrum. Moreover, we find that the time-reversed wave can be slowed down or accelerated, depending on the refractive index ratio. We show that this effect remains strong even when the refractive index varies arbitrarily slow, in sharp contradistinction to time-reflection which necessitates large index changes at sub-cycle rates. This is the first avenue found to yield significant negative-frequency waves using a temporal interface without the need for sub-cycle modulation or impedance matching. The effect can be used to record extreme ultrafast information and subsequently play it backwards at a slow rate, and vice-versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on needle beams and space-time wavepackets (STWPs) is presented. Quasi-nondiffracting STWPs propagate at stable spatial and temporal localization over extended distances. In a simple model, STWPs are interpreted as being composed of differential needle beams. Simulations indicate that pulsed Bessel-like needle beams can reach higher spectral and temporal homogeneity compared to spatio-spectrally shaped focused Gaussian beams. The interference of femtosecond needle beam arrays leads to nondiffracting self-imaging in space and time. High-speed switching of STWPs with combined optical systems, orbital angular momentum generation with self-torque and other emerging fields of research are addressed</description>

      <title>Respiration Rate Sensor Based on Fiber Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital sign with significant diagnostic value. Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion. Here, we propose a novel RR-monitoring sensor based on fiber-cavity attenuated phase-shift spectroscopy~(CAPS). The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements. Our sensor exhibits high reproducibility, strong sensitivity to strain and pressure induced by chest movements, inherent resistance to baseline drift, and the ability to detect body movements. The system achieves a root-mean-square error of 0.91 breaths per minute relative to the ground truth, across RR values ranging from 8 to 44 breaths per minute, when tested on multiple subjects in various postures, including sitting, supine, prone, and lateral positions. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of comprehensive optical fiber-based sleep monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: Exciton-polariton III-V semiconductor microcavities provide a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling topological photonics and quantum simulation for advanced photonic functionalities. Here, we introduce two novel fabrication techniques - etch-and-oversputter and deposit-and-oversputter - that overcome limitations of traditional photonic confinement. Both use structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavities to create deep, highly controllable potentials, while leveraging high-quality GaAs-based materials, which achieve excellent Q-factors. A sputtered all-dielectric top mirror introduces an innovative hybrid approach, simplifying fabrication while maintaining quality compared to deep ion etching. Utilizing a Kagome lattice as a benchmark, we show high-quality optical band structures previously inaccessible with deep etching. Furthermore, we study a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice and demonstrate polariton lasing from a zero-dimensional corner mode, confirming precise control over couplings and tight polariton localization. These methods enable fabrication of intricate lattices, including higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum regimes utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism due to tight photonic confinement.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Learning of Topological Bands in Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (PhCs) that support disorder-resistant modes, protected degeneracies, and robust transport have recently been explored for applications in waveguiding, optical isolation, light trapping, and lasing. However, designing PhCs with prescribed topological properties remains challenging because of the highly nonlinear mapping from the continuous real-space design of PhCs to the discrete output space of band topology. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to address this problem, employing Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) to predict and inversely design the band symmetries of two-dimensional PhCs with two-fold rotational (C2) symmetry. We show that a single-hidden-layer KAN, trained on a dataset of C2-symmetric unit cells, achieves high accuracy in classifying the topological classes of the lowest lying bands. We use the symbolic regression capabilities of KANs to extract algebraic formulas that express the topological classes directly in terms of the Fourier components of the dielectric function. These formulas not only retain the full predictive power of the network but also provide novel insights and enable deterministic inverse design. Using this approach, we generate photonic crystals with target topological bands, achieving high accuracy even for high-contrast, experimentally realizable structures beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic Physical Unclonable Functions and Reservoir-Inspired Computation with Low Symmetry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging applications of photonics in computing, sensing, and security increasingly demand complex input-output behaviors, including highly nonlinear transformations of optical signals. Traditional photonic systems rely on highly structured components with symmetric geometries and low-entropy modal responses to achieve predictable and analytically describable behavior. To achieve expressive functionality, this paradigm often requires large networks of fabrication-sensitive interferometers or resonators and substantial hardware error correction to restore deterministic operation. Here we demonstrate an alternative paradigm rooted in low-symmetry, disordered integrated photonic circuits, which provide intrinsically enhanced modal diversity and spectral complexity, enabling highly nonlinear transformations of input signals into information-rich outputs. Our devices, physically unclonable moire quasicrystal interferometers integrated on a silicon photonics platform, exhibit aperiodic and reconfigurable spectral responses and are characterized by analyticity breaking and erasable mutual information. Using dynamic thermo-optic control to drive their complex spectral dynamics, we demonstrate that these devices function as reconfigurable physical unclonable functions (rPUFs). We also highlight their ability to perform high-dimensional input-output transformations, emulating reservoir-inspired information processing in a compact photonic platform. This work bridges the gap between engineered and natural complexity in photonic systems, revealing new opportunities for scalable, energy-efficient, and information-dense optoelectronics with applications in secure communications, hardware security, advanced sensing, and optical information processing. Our results establish low-symmetry integrated photonics as a powerful resource for complex signal manipulation in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>High fidelity CNOT gates in photonic integrated circuits using composite segmented directional couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation, classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved agreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as compact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>A formalism for giant Goos-H\"anchen shift in metasurface sensors with phase singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shift becomes giant in resonant photonic structures, making it promising for refractive index sensors with ultimate sensitivities. We provide here a complete formalism to analytically describe the GH shift and its associated sensitivity around the critical coupling regime in photonic structures. This analytical framework quantitatively connects physical parameters such as the quality factor, the angular dispersion, the beam size and the phase singularity to the GH shift. We numerically confirm this theory in two practical designs: a surface plasmon resonance sensor and a Bloch surface wave (BSW) metasurface sensor. Coupling our theory with numerical simulations, we design a BSW metasurface whose GH sensitivity ($10^{13} \mu m/RIU$) is more than 5 orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the art.We also reveal that the main practical limitation to reach ultimate GH sensitivities is the beam size. However, taking into account realistic beam sizes and introducing engineering dispersion for the metasurface, we calculate limits of detection for GH sensors as low as $10^{-13} RIU$ that still surpass current sensors. These results open the way for new sensing application needing high sensitivity and low limit of detection.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised prior learning improves structured illumination microscopy resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a wide-field super-resolution technique normally limited to roughly twice the diffraction-limited resolution ($\approx 100$--$200$~nm). Surpassing this bound is a classic ill-posed inverse problem: recovering high-frequency structure from band-limited raw data. We introduce SIMFormer, a fully blind SIM reconstruction framework that learns a powerful, data-driven prior directly from raw images via self-supervision. This learned prior regularizes the solution and enables reliable extrapolation beyond the optical transfer function cutoff, yielding an effective resolution of approximately 45~nm. We validate SIMFormer on synthetic data and the BioSR dataset, where it resolves features such as flattened endoplasmic reticulum lipid bilayers previously reported to require STORM-level resolution. A self-distilled variant, SIMFormer+, further improves noise robustness while preserving high resolution at extremely low photon counts. These results show that learned priors can substantially extend SIM resolution and robustness, enabling rapid, large-scale imaging with STORM-level detail.</description>

Abstract: Period-averaged electromagnetic spin angular momentum is a well-established quantity for monochromatic fields, governing phenomena such as light-matter interactions with chiral particles and spin-orbit coupling effects. In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarization matrix and its physical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although electric and magnetic fields are intrinsically coupled in random stationary light, a complete and physically consistent second-order description of polarization requires a joint electromagnetic treatment. The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations.</description>

      <title>Controlled manipulation of solitons in a recirculating fiber loop using external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons are self-sustained wave packets that propagate without distortion due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. Their unique stability underpins key photonic applications while also playing a central role in nonlinear wave physics. However, real-time control over soliton dynamics in non-dissipative systems remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applications in photonic systems. Here, we introduce a fiber-based platform for soliton manipulation, by creating programmable external potentials through synchronous arbitrary phase modulation in a recirculating optical fiber loop. We demonstrate precise soliton trapping, parametric excitation, and coupled multi-soliton interactions, revealing particle-like behavior in excellent agreement with a Hamiltonian description in which solitons are treated as interacting classical particles. The strong analogy with matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates highlights the broader implications of our approach, which provides a versatile experimental tool for the study of nonlinear wave dynamics and engineered soliton manipulation.</description>
