      <title>Power law cosmology in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with pragmatic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an approach $ f(R, G) $ gravity incorporating power law in $ G $. To study the cosmic evolution of the universe given by the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter given by $ E(z) = \bigg( 1+\frac{z(\alpha+(1+z)^{\beta})}{2 \beta + 1} \bigg)^{\frac{3}{2 \beta}} $. Subsequently, we use various recent observational datasets of OHD, Pantheon, and BAO to estimate the model parameters $ H_0,~\alpha $, and $ \beta $ applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique in the emcee package to establish the validity of the model. In our findings, we observe that our model shows consistency with standard $ \Lambda $CDM, transits from deceleration to acceleration, and enters the quintessence region in late times. The cosmological model satisfies necessary energy constraints, simultaneously violating the strong energy condition (SEC), indicating a repulsive nature and consistent with accelerated expansion. The cosmic evolution of the Hawking temperature and the total entropy for the various observational datasets also show the validity of the model. Thus, our established model demonstrates sufficient potential for explicitly describing cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Comparing Analytic and Numerical Studies of Tensor Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of different quantization approaches in Loop Quantum Cosmology for the primordial power spectrum of tensor modes. Specifically, we consider the hybrid and dressed metric approaches to derive the effective mass that governs the evolution of the tensor modes. Our study comprehensively examines the two resulting effective masses and how to estimate them in order to obtain approximated analytic solutions to the tensor perturbation equations. Since Loop Quantum Cosmology incorporates preinflationary effects in the dynamics of the perturbations, we do not have at our disposal a standard choice of privileged vacuum, like the Bunch--Davies state in quasi-de Sitter inflation. We then select the vacuum state by a recently proposed criterion which removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum and guarantees an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the ultraviolet. This vacuum is usually called the NO-AHD (from the initials of Non-Oscillating with Asymptotic Hamiltonian Diagonalization) vacuum. Consequently, we compute the power spectrum by using our analytic approximations and by introducing a suitable numerical procedure, adopting in both cases an NO-AHD vacuum. With this information, we compare the different spectra obtained from the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches, as well as from the analytic and numerical procedures. In particular, this proves the remarkable accuracy of our~approximations.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in Rastall-scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A violation of the usual conservation law is proposed in Rastall theory. We consider two generalizations of Rastall theory: Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory and the newly established Rastall-scalar-tensor theory, the latter being a further generalization of the former. The field equations in these two generalized theories are studied across different parameter space, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves, as a key focus, are subsequently investigated. The results show that the polarization modes of gravitational waves in Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory are the same as those in Brans-Dicke theory; specifically, both theories exhibit the plus, cross, and breathing modes. However, in Rastall-scalar-tensor theory, the polarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter space of the theory. Particularly, over a broad range of the parameter space, regardless of some special values of the parameters, it allows only two tensor modes, just as in general relativity, without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. This indicates that Rastall theory offers a novel approach to constructing modified gravity theories that propagate only two tensor degrees of freedom. In the remaining regions of the parameter space, there is also one scalar mode in addition to the two tensor modes. The scalar mode can be either a mixture of the breathing and longitudinal modes or just a pure breathing mode, depending on the parameter space. These results will play a crucial role in constraining the theoretical parameters through future gravitational wave detection projects, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin.</description>

      <title>Removing naked singularities in static axially symmetric spacetimes by patching with the flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static, axially symmetric spacetimes without naked singularities that are constructed by patching Weyl class spacetimes with the flat spacetimes. Once the exterior geometry is specified, the junction conditions determine the shape of a thin shell, which is the boundary between the two patched spacetimes, and the distribution of the energy and pressure on this shell, leaving a parameter representing the shell size free. We examine the cases where the exterior of the shell is given by Curzon--Chazy or Zipoy--Voorhees spacetimes. For each case, we find a lower bound on the shell size. Additionally, we find that the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied for any shell size, while the dominant energy condition is satisfied for sufficiently large shells. These results provide concrete examples of non-singular spacetimes with non-spherically symmetric exteriors that respect the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions of Dirac particles affected from magnetized 2+1 curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the quantum and classical phase transitions of the Dirac particles in a homogeneously magnetized curved rotating 2+1 dimensional spacetime. We consider the intricate relationship between geometry and quantum phase events through the study of quantum electrodynamics in the rotating curved spacetime. Using methods from quantum electrodynamics and statistical mechanics, the study examines the effects of an external magnetic field, the background rotation parameter, and curvature on the characteristics of quantum and classical phase transitions, focusing on critical points and scaling behavior, and we see that as thermal fluctuations get closer to zero, quantum fluctuations begin to dominate at this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the analog of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in conformal Killing gravity in a static spherically symmetric spacetime, sourced by perfect fluid matter. It differs from the original by `dark terms' associated to the conformal Killing tensor. Then we study the junction conditions for a sphere of perfect fluid in the Conformal Killing Gravity vacuum (dark fluid environment), and solve the equations for the sphere with uniform matter density.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binary Black Hole Simulations with Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of eccentric orbiting nonspinning black hole binaries. We first make a technical study of the optimal full numerical techniques to apply to these studies. We choose different gauge parameters and Courant factors, $c=dx/dt$, and find an optimal value for it of 0.45. We also find the grid structure and global resolution that optimize accuracy and speed of current computational resources. With these choices we perform a study of the merger times $t_m$ as a function of eccentricity for configurations with comparable orbital energy content and find that they are well represented by the post-Newtonian factor $F(e)=(1+73e^2/24+37e^4/96)/(1-e^2)^{7/2}$ when merger times are normalized to their quasicircular values, i.e. $t_m(e)/t_m\approx F(e)$. We then perform a systematic coverage of five small-medium eccentricities up to $e\sim0.45$ and six mass ratios up to 8.5:1 producing a total of 30 simulations covering up to 25 orbits to merger to further model merger times and as a seed to a forthcoming new systematic catalog of gravitational waveforms from eccentric binary black holes to directly perform parameter estimations of gravitational waves events.</description>

      <title>Weak Energy Condition, Trapped Surfaces and Black hole Third Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the third law of thermodynamics for families of 4- and n-dimensional Vaidya black holes, including many of interest. Since there are several versions of the definition of surface gravity as well as the extremality condition for dynamical black holes, we first show that for the considered 4- and n-dimensional Vaidya families, these definitions are consistent with each other. We assume, first, that a non-extremal black hole evolves to an extremality state after a finite time and second, that the weak energy condition for the source holds at all times. We then compare the results of these assumptions and investigate whether there are ranges of black hole parameters where these two assumptions are in conflict.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz inextendibility of weak null singularities from curvature blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <title>Interaction between Unruh-Dewitt detectors exclusively due to acceleration: A Parallel to the FDU Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered an interaction between two detectors in a vacuum that emerges exclusively due to acceleration, akin to the spontaneous excitation of a single detector as predicted by the Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) effect. However, this interaction contrasts sharply with the FDU effect, which suggests that a uniformly accelerated detector behaves as if it were in a thermal bath, as the discovered interaction does not manifest in a thermal environment. The novel interaction displays unique dependencies on the separation between detectors: it can be either attractive or repulsive, with the potential to transition between these behaviors as the inter-detector separation changes. More intriguingly, it exhibits a surprising large-small duality in its dependence on acceleration, suggesting the existence of an optimal acceleration at which the interaction is strongest, in contrast to the monotonic acceleration-dependence of the FDU effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical homogenization in effective loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective dynamics of loop quantum gravity for marginally bound Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes predict that the big-bang singularity is resolved and replaced by a cosmic bounce. Numerics show that these effective dynamics also homogenize small regions soon after the bounce when inhomogeneities before the bounce are sufficiently large. These homogeneous regions typically have a width of a few Planck lengths where relative perturbations in the energy density remain less than 15%. If the bounce is followed by an inflationary period, the homogeneous region can reach cosmic scales and the amplitude of relative perturbations can be suppressed to a value compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Dual Dressed Black Holes as the end point of the Charged Superradiant instability in ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged Black holes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ suffer from superradiant instabilities over a range of energies. Hairy black hole solutions (constructed within gauged supergravity) have previously been proposed as endpoints to this instability. We demonstrate that these hairy black holes are themselves unstable to the emission of large dual giant gravitons. We propose that the endpoint to this instability is given by Dual Dressed Black Holes (DDBH)s; configurations consisting of one, two, or three very large dual giant gravitons surrounding a core $AdS$ black hole with one, two, or three $SO(6)$ chemical potentials equal to unity. The dual giants each live at $AdS$ radial coordinates of order $\sqrt{N}$ and each carry charge of order $N^2$. The large separation makes DDBHs a very weakly interacting mix of their components and allows for a simple computation of their thermodynamics. We conjecture that DDBHs dominate the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills over a range of energies around the BPS plane, and provide an explicit construction of this phase diagram, briefly discussing the interplay with supersymmetry. We develop the quantum description of dual giants around black hole backgrounds and explicitly verify that DDBHs are stable to potential tunneling instabilities, precisely when the chemical potentials of the core black holes equal unity. We also construct the 10-dimensional DDBH supergravity solutions.</description>

      <title>Long-lived neutron-star remnants from asymmetric binary neutron star mergers: element formation, kilonova signals and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of asymmetric binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived neutron stars remnants and spanning a fraction of their cooling time scale. Two binaries with mass ratios of $1.77$ and $1.49$ described by a stiff and a soft microphysical equation of state are considered. The mergers are characterized by significant tidal disruption with neutron rich material forming a massive disc around the remnant. The latter develops a one-armed dynamics that is imprinted in the emitted kilo-Hertz gravitational waves. Angular momentum transport to the disc is initially driven by spiral-density waves and enhanced by turbulent viscosity and neutrino heating on longer timescales. The mass outflows are composed by neutron-rich dynamical ejecta of mass ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_\odot$ followed by a persistent spiral-wave/neutrino-driven wind of ${\gtrsim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ with material spanning a wide range of electron fractions, ${\sim}0.1-0.55$. For the stiff EOS and largest mass ratio binary, tidal dynamical ejecta have fast tails up to velocities ${\sim}0.8$~c. The outflows are further evolved to days timescale using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that include an online nuclear network. We find complete $r$-process yields and identify the production of $^{56}$Ni and the subsequent decay chain to $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe. Synthetic kilonova light curves predict an extended (near-) infrared peak a few days postmerger originating from $r$-processes in the neutron-rich/high-opacity ejecta and a UV/optical peak a few hours postmerger originating from weak $r$-processes in the faster ejecta components. Additionally, the fast tail of tidal origin generates kilonova afterglows potentially detectable in radio and X band on a few to ten years timescale. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>Consistent Canonical Quantization of Gravity: Recovery of Classical GR from BRST-invariant Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of General Relativity, as an effective quantum field theory below the Planck scale, within the BRST-invariant framework. We show that the promotion of constraints to dynamical equations of motion for auxiliary fields leads to the healthy Hamiltonian flow. In particular, we show that the classical properties of Einstein's gravity, such as vanishing Hamiltonian modulo boundary contribution, is realized merely as an expectation value in appropriate physical states. Most importantly, the physicality is shown not to entail trivial time-evolution for correlation functions. In the present approach we quantize the theory once and for all around the Minkowaski vacuum and treat other would-be classical backgrounds as BRST-invariant coherent states. This is especially important for cosmological spacetimes as it uncovers features that are not visible in ordinary semi-classical treatment. The Poincar\'e invariance of the vacuum, essential for our quantization, provides strong motivation for spontaneously-broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of dRGT ghost-free massive gravity in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on dRGT massive gravity in spherical symmetry in the limit of small graviton mass. Firstly we examine the minimal model. This does not exhibit a Vainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, but one may still ask what happens for spherical dynamics. We show that there are no regular time-dependent spherically symmetric solutions unless the matter has sufficiently large pressure. For matter that does not satisfy this, such as non-relativistic matter, any Cauchy slice of such a solution must necessarily have a point where the metric becomes singular. Only a weak assumption on the asymptotics is made. We then consider the next-to-minimal model. This has been argued to have a good Vainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, and hence be phenomenologically viable, provided the relative sign of the minimal and next-to-minimal mass terms is the same, and we restrict attention to this case. We find that regular behaviour requires the matter at the origin of symmetry to have positive pressure -- in particular a massive scalar field fails to satisfy this condition. Furthermore it restricts non-relativistic matter so that the pressure is bounded from below in terms of the density and graviton mass in a manner that is at odds with a reasonable phenomenology. This suggests that realistic phenomenology will either require a resolution of singularities, or will require dynamics beyond the non-generic setting of spherical symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent astrophysical observations, we investigate the shadow behaviors of four dimensional charged rotating black holes with a cosmological constant. This study is made in terms of a reduced moduli space parameterized by the charge and the rotation parameters. For fixed observers, we analyse in some details the shadow behaviors and the corresponding naked singularities of Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen four-dimensional black holes in Anti de Sitter backgrounds. Then, a comparative discussion is provided by computing the geometrical observables and the energy emission rate.</description>

      <title>3+1 formulation of light modes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 3+1 formulation of the light modes in nonlinear electrodynamics described by Plebanski-type Lagrangians, which include Post-Maxwellian, Born-Infeld, ModMax, and Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger QED Lagrangians. In nonlinear electrodynamics, strong electromagnetic fields modify the vacuum to acquire optical properties. Such a field-modified vacuum can possess electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and magneto-electric response, inducing novel phenomena like vacuum birefringence. By exploiting the mathematical structures of Plebanski-type Lagrangians, we obtain a streamlined procedure and explicit formulas to determine light modes, i.e., refractive indices and polarization vectors for a given propagation direction. We also work out the light modes of the mentioned Lagrangians for an arbitrarily strong magnetic field. The 3+1 formulation advanced in this paper has direct applications to the current vacuum birefringence research: terrestrial experiments using permanent magnets/ultra-intense lasers for the subcritical regime and astrophysical observation of the x-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars for the near-critical and supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>TDI noises transfer functions for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LISA mission is the future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory of the European Space Agency. It is formed by 3 spacecraft exchanging laser beams in order to form multiple real and virtual interferometers. The data streams to be used in order to extract the large number and variety of GW sources are Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) data. One important processing to produce these data is the TDI on-ground processing which recombines multiple interferometric on-board measurements to remove certain noise sources from the data such as laser frequency noise or spacecraft jitter. The LISA noise budget is therefore expressed at the TDI level in order to account for the different TDI transfer functions applied for each noise source and thus estimate their real weight on mission performance. In order to derive a usable form of these transfer functions, a model of the beams, the measurements, and TDI have been developed, and several approximation have been made. A methodology for such a derivation has been established, as well as verification procedures. It results in a set of transfer functions, which are now used by the LISA project, in particular in its performance model. Using these transfer functions, realistic noise curves for various instrumental configurations are provided to data analysis algorithms and used for instrument design.</description>

      <title>Analytic Primordial Power Spectrum in the Dressed Metric Approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology and Thermodynamics of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectrum of cosmological tensor perturbations in the dressed metric approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We compute the background-dependent effective mass that affects their propagation using the effective description of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that this mass can be approximated in different cosmological epochs by appropriate analytic functions. Moreover, in each of those epochs we can analytically solve the propagation of the perturbations, then obtaining the general solution globally by continuity requirements. On the other hand, since there are regimes far away from slow roll in the considered background evolution, the Bunch-Davies state does not provide a privileged choice of vacuum that would pick out a specific solution for the perturbations. Instead, we select the state of these perturbations by a recently proposed criterion that removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum. We compute the spectrum of this vacuum and compare it with other spectra obtained in the literature, especially with one corresponding to the hybrid approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. Finally, we notice that the same type of background dynamics is found in a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on thermodynamics, allowing in this case a free value for the tantamount of the critical density. Extending the dressed metric proposal to this phenomenological model, one might expect a similar form for the associated primordial power spectrum.</description>

Abstract: In spite or the large astronomical evidence for its existence, the nature of dark matter remains enigmatic. Particles that interact only, or almost only, gravitationally, in particular with masses around the Planck mass -- the fundamental scale in quantum gravity, are intriguing candidates. Here we show that there is a theoretical possibility to directly detect such particles using highly sensitive gravity-mediated quantum phase shifts. In particular, we consider a protocol utilizing Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the universe and its subtleties is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology. A lot of different approaches have been put forward to deal with this, ranging from the conventional cosmological constant to various models of dark energy and beyond. Recently one very interesting approach to explaining the late time acceleration has been put forward, where the the expansion of the universe is driven by mergers with other "baby" universes and has been shown to be quite viable as well from the point of view of recent observational data. So in this work we examine the possibility of various rip scenarios and other future cosmological singularities in such "multiversal" scenario, probing such singularities for the first time in a multi universe scenario. We examine two models of such a baby universe merging cosmology, and show that remarkably no rip scenario or future cosmological singularity is possible in such models.</description>

Abstract: We explore alternative formulations of the analogy between viable Horndeski gravity and Eckart's first-order thermodynamics. We single out a class of identifications for the effective stress-energy tensor of the scalar field fluid that, upon performing the imperfect fluid decomposition, yields constitutive relations that can be mapped onto Eckart's theory. We then investigate how different couplings to Einstein's gravity, at the level of the field equations, can affect the thermodynamic formalism overall. Last, we specialize the discussion to the case of ``traditional'' scalar-tensor theories and identify a specific choice of the coupling function that leads to a significant simplification of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Dark energy with a shift-symmetric scalar field: obstacles, loophole hunting and dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a scalar field being the fundamental description of dark energy. We focus on shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories since this symmetry potentially avoids some fine-tuning problems. We also restrict attention to theories satisfying that the propagation speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light. These considerations lead us to investigate shift-symmetric Kinetic Gravity Braiding theories. Analysing the stability of scalar linear perturbations, we discuss the conditions that seems to be necessary to describe (super) accelerated cosmic expansion without introducing instabilities. However, it has been previously established that the linearised analysis does not guarantee the stability of this non-canonical scalar theory, as potentially dangerous interactions between dark energy fluctuations and tensor perturbations (essentially gravitational waves) appear at a higher order in perturbation theory. Indeed, although we shall point out that the standard proof of absence of dark energy stable braiding models due to this interaction has a possible way-out, we find general arguments suggesting that there are no dark energy stable solutions that can exploit this loophole. Thus, we discuss future research directions for finding viable fundamental descriptions of dark energy. We also provide a dictionary between the covariant version of the scalar field theory and that of the Effective Field Theory approach, explicitly computing the parameters in the latter formalism in terms of the functions appearing in the covariant version, and its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these expressions are explicitly obtained up-to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the formulation of a singularity theorem for timelike curves including torsion, and establishes the foundational framework necessary for its derivation. We begin by deriving the relative acceleration for an arbitrary congruence of timelike curves. The resulting ``deviation equation'' offers an alternative pathway to the well-known Raychaudhuri equation with torsion. Conjugate points are then introduced and analyzed in relation to the behavior of the scalar expansion. Together with the sensible requirement of hypersurface orthogonality, the Raychaudhuri equation is examined for several specific cases of torsion that are prominent in the literature. Our findings indicate that a totally antisymmetric torsion tensor does not influence the behavior of the congruence of timelike curves. Finally, we formulate a singularity theorem for timelike curves and highlight the critical requirement of non-autoparallel curves.</description>

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability, we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of intensively explored recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

Abstract: We present a new family of regular black holes (RBH) in Pure Lovelock gravity, where the energy density is determined by the gravitational vacuum tension, which varies for each value of $n$ in each Lovelock case. Speculatively, our model may capture quantum effects through gravitational tension. In this way, a hypothetical analogy is drawn between the pair production ratio in the Schwinger effect and our energy density. A notable feature of our model is that the regular solution closely resembles the vacuum solution before reaching the event horizon. For odd $n$, the transverse geometry is spherical, with phase transitions occurring during evaporation, and the final state of this process is a remnant. For even $n$, the transverse geometry is non trivial and corresponds to a hyperboloid. In the case of $d=2n+1$ with even $n$, we find an RBH without a dS core and no inner horizon (whose presence has been recently debated in the literature due to the question of whether its presence is unstable or not), and no phase transitions. For $d &gt; 2n + 1$ with even $n$, the RBH possesses both an event horizon and a cosmological horizon, also with no inner horizon present. The existence of the cosmological horizon arises without the usual requirement of a positive cosmological constant. From both numerical and analytical analysis, we deduce that as the event horizon expands and the cosmological horizon contracts, thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in a remnant when the two horizons coincide.</description>

      <title>The magnetic black hole solution under nonlinear electrodynamics theory, its EM-gravity coupled perturbation and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a series of exact solutions to Einstein-Maxwell equation under nonlinear electrodynamics theory (NED), which are considered as a natural extension of the dyonic RN solution. Our results are based on a general premise demanding a spherically symmetric spacetime but with few restrictions on the specific form of the EM action. We discuss some of its characteristics including ADM mass, quasi-local mass, asymptotic behavior, energy condition and so on. We study the EM-gravity coupled perturbation in this spacetime using Newman-Penrose (NP) form, which can be regarded as a small generalization of this method. We also generalize the former formula computing energy and angular momentum flux from the black hole horizon to study the super radiance of the Dirac field in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Limit on spatial quantum superpositions with massive objects due to phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing goal to bring massive objects into a superposition of different locations in real space, not only to confirm quantum theory in new regimes, but also to explore the interface with gravity. The main challenge is usually thought to arise from forces or scattering due to environmental fields and particles that decohere the large object's wave function into a statistical mixture. We unveil a decoherence channel which cannot be eliminated by improved isolation from the environment. It originates from sound waves within the object, which are excited as part of any splitting process and carry partial "Welcher Weg" information. This puts stringent constraints on future spatial superpositions of large objects.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions as Early Dark Energy resolutions to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide class of scalar field models including Quintessence and K-essence have the attractive property of tracker regimes, where the energy density stored in the field evolves so as to mimic that of the dominant background component for a period of time. During this evolution, for a brief period of time there is an increase in the energy density of the field as it spirals in towards it's attractor solution. We show that when the peak of this energy density occurs around the epoch of equality, we can address a key requirement of early dark energy (EDE), postulated as a solution to the Hubble tension. In particular we demonstrate how this can occur in a wide class of Quintessence, axion and K-essence models, before showing that the Quintessence models suffer in that they generally lead to sound speeds incompatible with the requirements of EDE, whereas the K-essence and axion models can do a better job of fitting the data.</description>

      <title>Multiway Junction Conditions: Booklets and Webs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Junction conditions play a crucial role in constructing new gravity solutions. In this paper, we derive the junction condition for gluing together an arbitrary number of spacetimes along a common interface. We develop a geometric technique of reverse extension and provide precise definitions of geometric quantities at the interface. This leads to a geometric derivation of the multiway junction condition. As a cross-check, we independently re-derive the junction condition by varying the action of some specific gravitational models including both Einstein gravity and dilaton gravity. We demonstrate that the junction condition is invariant under a change of frames, and the form of the junction condition is the same for both spacelike and timelike interfaces.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame with a dynamical magnetic field perturbed on a constant configuration. We develop a simple and general algorithm for an analytic solution search that works on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion. This method can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. Applying our method to the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the method finds a complete set of solutions. We obtain two sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time due to the difficulties originating from coupled degrees of freedom and strong anisotropy provided by a magnetic field. The newly developed method resolves these difficulties. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. This identifies the origin of a discrepancy found in recent works. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Braneworlds: Cosmology and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 4D flat Big Bang-Big Crunch cosmologies and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) planar eternally traversable wormholes using braneworlds embedded in asymptotically AdS${}_5$ spacetimes. The background geometries are the AdS${}_5$ magnetic black brane and the magnetically charged AdS${}_5$ soliton, respectively. The two setups arise from different analytic continuations of the same saddle of the gravitational Euclidean path integral, in which the braneworld takes the form of a Maldacena-Maoz Euclidean wormhole. We show the existence of a holographic dual description of this setup in terms of a microscopic Euclidean boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) on a strip. By analyzing the BCFT Euclidean path integral, we show that the braneworld cosmology is encoded in a pure excited state of a CFT dual to a black brane microstate, whereas the braneworld wormhole is encoded in the ground state of the BCFT. The latter confines in the IR, and we study its confining properties using holography. We also comment on the properties of bulk reconstruction in the two Lorentzian pictures and their relationship via double analytic continuation. This work can be interpreted as an explicit, doubly-holographic realization of the relationship between cosmology, traversable wormholes, and confinement in holography, first proposed in arXiv:2102.05057, arXiv:2203.11220.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>On the classical limit of the (sub)$^{n}$-leading soft graviton theorems in $D = 4$ without deflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-level gravitational amplitudes satisfy an infinite hierarchy of soft factorization theorems. The existence of these theorems has been recently linked with the existence of an infinite tower of asymptotic symmetries. In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the soft graviton theorems beyond sub-leading order in the context of classical gravitational scattering in four dimensions. More in detail, we show that the infinite impact parameter limit of the late-time gravitational field emitted during a classical scattering can be derived using these factorization theorems. The classical field obtained in this (infinite impact parameter) regime has an expansion in the frequency of the detector where the modes scale as $\omega^{n}\log{\omega}$ with a vanishing memory.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>
