      <title>Realizing Algebra Structures on Free Resolutions of Grade 3 Perfect Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect ideals of grade 3 can be classified based on algebra structures on their minimal free resolutions. The classification is incomplete in the sense that it remains open which of the possible algebra structures actually occur; this realizability question was formally posed by Avramov in 2012. Of five classes of algebra structures, the realizability question has been answered for one class. In this work, we answer the realizability question for two classes and contribute towards an answer for a third.</description>

      <title>A binary tree of complete intersections with the strong Lefschetz property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a new family of complete intersections which have the strong Lefschetz property. The family consists of (Artinian algebras defined by) ideals generated by power sum symmetric polynomials of consecutive degrees and of certain ideals naturally derived from them. This family has a structure of a binary tree and this observation is a key to prove that all members in it have the strong Lefschetz property.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic complexity of computing Gr\"obner bases of comaximal determinantal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of homogeneous linear forms over a field $\Bbbk$. If the ideal $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ generated by minors of size $n-1$ is Cohen-Macaulay, then the Gulliksen-Neg{\aa}rd complex is a free resolution of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. It has recently been shown that by taking into account the syzygy modules for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ which can be obtained from this complex, one can derive a refined signature-based Gr\"obner basis algorithm DetGB which avoids reductions to zero when computing a grevlex Gr\"obner basis for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. In this paper, we establish sharp complexity bounds on DetGB. To accomplish this, we prove several results on the sizes of reduced grevlex Gr\"obner bases of reverse lexicographic ideals, thanks to which we obtain two main complexity results which rely on conjectures similar to that of Fr\"oberg. The first one states that, in the zero-dimensional case, the size of the reduced grevlex Gr\"obner basis of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ is bounded from below by $n^{6}$ asymptotically. The second, also in the zero-dimensional case, states that the complexity of DetGB is bounded from above by $n^{2\omega+3}$ asymptotically, where $2\le\omega\le 3$ is any complexity exponent for matrix multiplication over $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>On the integrality of \'etale extensions of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a valuation theorem for Noetherian rings, recently obtained by Rangachev, to prove that for any non-integral \'etale extension $A\subset B$ of polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the integral closure $\overline{A}$ of $A$ in $B$ has infinite cyclic divisor class group, where the generator is a prime divisor equal to the complement of $\textrm{Spec}(B)$ in $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$. Moreover, this prime divisor coincides with the ramification divisor of the finite extension $A\subset \overline{A}$. We apply this result to carry out Wright's geometric approach for two-dimensional non-integral \'etale extensions. It follows from our main theorem and the work of Miyanishi that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is a smooth affine surface. We show that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is an $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, more precisely a Danilov-Gizatullin surface of index three. Based on Wright's analysis of which of these affine surfaces can factorize an \'etale morphism of the complex affine plane and his description of its affine coordinate rings we prove that any two-dimensional complex \'etale extension is integral.</description>

      <title>On Positive Matching Decomposition Conjectures of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the conjectures of Gharakhloo and Welker (2023) that the positive matching decomposition number (pmd) of a $3$-uniform hypergraph is bounded from above by a polynomial of degree $2$ in terms of the number of vertices. Moreover, we derive a lower bound for pmd specifically for complete $3$-uniform hypergraphs. Additionally, we obtain an upper bound for pmd of $r$-uniform hypergraphs. For a $r$-uniform hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$ such that $\lvert e_i\cap e_j\rvert \leq 1$ for all $e_i,e_j \in E$, we give a characterization of positive matching in terms of strong alternate closed walks. For specific classes of a hypergraph, we classify the radical and complete intersection Lov\'{a}sz$-$Saks$-$Schrijver ideals.</description>

      <title>Solving Degree Bounds For Iterated Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Arithmetization-Oriented ciphers and hash functions Gr\"obner basis attacks are generally considered as the most competitive attack vector. Unfortunately, the complexity of Gr\"obner basis algorithms is only understood for special cases, and it is needless to say that these cases do not apply to most cryptographic polynomial systems. Therefore, cryptographers have to resort to experiments, extrapolations and hypotheses to assess the security of their designs. One established measure to quantify the complexity of linear algebra-based Gr\"obner basis algorithms is the so-called solving degree. Caminata \&amp; Gorla revealed that under a certain genericity condition on a polynomial system the solving degree is always upper bounded by the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and henceforth by the Macaulay bound, which only takes the degrees and number of variables of the input polynomials into account. In this paper we extend their framework to iterated polynomial systems, the standard polynomial model for symmetric ciphers and hash functions. In particular, we prove solving degree bounds for various attacks on MiMC, Feistel-MiMC, Feistel-MiMC-Hash, Hades and GMiMC. Our bounds fall in line with the hypothesized complexity of Gr\"obner basis attacks on these designs, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a mathematical proof for these complexities is provided.
  Moreover, by studying polynomials with degree falls we can prove lower bounds on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for attacks on MiMC, Feistel-MiMC and Feistel-MiMC-Hash provided that only a few solutions of the corresponding iterated polynomial system originate from the base field. Hence, regularity-based solving degree estimations can never surpass a certain threshold, a desirable property for cryptographic polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>On two-dimensional minimal linear codes over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two dimensional minimal linear code over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$(where $p$ is prime). We show that if the generator matrix $G$ of the two dimensional linear code $M$ contains $p^n+p^{n-1}$ column vector of the following type {\scriptsize{$u_{l_1}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_2}\begin{pmatrix} 0\\1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_3}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_4}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_2 \end{pmatrix}$,...,$u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1\\u_{p^n-p^{n-1}} \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+3}}\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n-p^{n-1}+4}}\begin{pmatrix} d_2\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$,..., $u_{l_{p^n+1}}\begin{pmatrix} d_{p^{n-1}-1}\\1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n+2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\d_1 \end{pmatrix}$, $u_{l_{p^n+3}}\begin{pmatrix} 1\\d_2 \end{pmatrix}$,...,$u_{l_{p^n+p^{n-1}}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\d_{p^{n-1}-1} \end{pmatrix}$}}, where $u_i$ and $d_j$ are distinct units and zero divisors respectively in the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$ for $1\leq i \leq p^n+p^{n-1}$, $1\leq j \leq p^{n-1}-1$ and additionally, denote $u_{l_i}$ as units in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}$, then the module generated by $G$ is a minimal linear code. Also we show that if any one column vector of the above types are not present entirely in $G$, then the generated module is not a minimal linear code.</description>

      <title>On Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences and related Gr\"{o}bner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gr\"{o}bner bases are nowadays central tools for solving various problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. A typical use of Gr\"{o}bner bases is the multivariate polynomial system solving, which enables us to construct algebraic attacks against post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Therefore, the determination of the complexity of computing Gr\"{o}bner bases is very important both in theory and in practice: One of the most important cases is the case where input polynomials compose an (overdetermined) affine semi-regular sequence. The first part of this paper aims to present a survey on Gr\"{o}bner basis computation and its complexity. In the second part, we shall give an explicit formula on the (truncated) Hilbert-Poincar\'{e} series associated to the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence. Based on the formula, we also study (reduced) Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideals generated by an affine semi-regular sequence and its homogenization. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence.</description>
