      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>PINNs Study for the Bekki-Nozaki Chaos in the Non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study chaotic behavior in the forced dissipative non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so called the Bekki-Nozaki equation. Chaotic systems are often seen in a strong sensitivity to initial conditions,leading to error accumulation over time when traditional numerical methods are applied. To address this difficulty, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs), a mesh-free deep learning framework. PINNs mitigate error accumulation in chaotic systems by solving partial differential equations without discretizing the computational domain. We demonstrate that PINNs successfully reproduce chaotic behavior of the Bekki-Nozaki equation. The results of the inverse analysis indicate a correlation between the governing equation's predictability and its chaotic nature of the solution.</description>

      <title>Rational solutions of Painlev\'e V from Hankel determinants and the asymptotics of their pole locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the poles of certain rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation. These solutions are constructed by relating the corresponding tau function with a Hankel determinant of a certain sequence of moments. This approach was also used by one of the authors and collaborators in the study of the rational solutions of the second Painlev\'e equation. More specifically we study the roots of the corresponding polynomial tau function, whose location corresponds to the poles of the associated rational solution. We show that, upon suitable rescaling, the roots fill a well-defined region bounded by analytic arcs when the degree of the polynomial tau function tends to infinity. Moreover we provide an approximate location of these roots within the region in terms of suitable quantization conditions.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with decaying initial data \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x+\kappa u_{x}=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\kappa$ is a constant. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402 (2022) 108340) reported the long-time asymptotic results for the mCH equation in the different solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the asymptotic behavior of the mCH equation in the transition regions, which are the critical regions between the different solitonic regions. The key is to establish a connection between the solution for the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation in the transition region and the Painlev\'{e} II equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}-2\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}+1/4\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we obtain that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <title>New Lie systems from Goursat distributions: reductions and reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that types of bracket-generating distributions lead to new classes of Lie systems with compatible geometric structures. Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules.</description>
