      <title>Numerical evaluation of the integrals of motion in particle accelerator tracking codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle tracking codes are one of the fundamental tools used in the design and the study of complex magnetic lattices in accelerator physics. For most practical applications, non-linear lenses are included and the Courant-Snyder formalism falls short of a complete description of the motion. Likewise, when the longitudinal motion is added, synchro-betatron coupling complicates the dynamics and different formalisms are typically needed to explain the motion. In this paper, a revised formalism is proposed based on the Fourier expansion of the trajectory -- known to be foundational in the KAM theorem -- which naturally describes non-linear motion in 2D, 4D and 6D. After extracting the fundamental frequencies and the Fourier coefficients from tracking data, it is shown that an approximate energy manifold (an invariant torus) can be constructed from the single-particle motion. This cornerstone allows to visualize and compute the areas of the torus projections in all conjugate planes, conserved under symplectic transformations. These are the integrals of motion, ultimately expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients. As a numerical demonstration of this formalism, the case of the 6-dimensional Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is studied. Examples from the 2D and 4D H\'enon map are also provided. Even for heavily smeared and intricate non-linear motion, it is shown that invariant tori accurately describe the motion of single particles for a large region of the phase space, as suggested by the KAM theorem.</description>

      <title>Homogenized harmonic balance finite element method for nonlinear eddy current simulations of fast corrector magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM) to predict the dynamic behavior of magnets with fast excitation cycles, including eddy current and skin effects. A homogenization technique for laminated yokes avoids resolving the individual lam- inates and the skin depth in the finite element (FE) mesh. Instead, the yoke is represented by a bulk surrogate material with frequency-dependent parameters. The ferromagnetic saturation of the yoke at higher excitation currents is tackled by a harmonic balance method, which accounts for a coupled set of frequency components. Thereby, a computationally expensive time-stepping of the eddy-current field problem and a convolution of the homogenized yoke model are avoided. The HomHBFEM enables, for the first time, to conduct nonlinear simulations of fast corrector magnets, which are embedded in a fast orbit feedback system to counteract orbit disturbances over a broad frequency spectrum, and thus guarantee a stable light-source operation. The results show the impact of the nonlinearity on the phase lag and the field attenuation as well as the eddy current losses at frequencies up to 65 kHz. The numerical validation for a C-dipole magnet example shows that the HomHBFEM achieves a sufficient accuracy at an affordable computational effort, with simulation times of a few hours. In comparison, standard 3D transient FE simulations need to resolve the lamination thickness and the skin depth in space and the largest relevant frequency in time, which leads to a two to three orders of magnitude larger mesh and prohibitive computational effort, with simulation times of a few weeks on a contemporary computer server.</description>

      <title>HALHF: a hybrid, asymmetric, linear Higgs factory using plasma- and RF-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HALHF is a hybrid linear collider that uses electron-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration to accelerate electrons to high energy while using radio-frequency cavity technology to accelerate positrons. The most cost-effective solution collides low-energy positrons with high-energy electrons, producing a boost to the final state in the electron direction with $\gamma= 1.67$. The current HALHF baseline design produces a luminosity comparable to that of the baseline ILC but with a greatly reduced construction and carbon footprint and hence much lower cost than the mature linear-collider designs ILC and CLIC. Costs for HALHF are evaluated, together with that for the approximate 15-year R\&amp;D programme necessary to realise HALHF. Time scales and cost for the R\&amp;D are estimated. Upgrade paths for HALHF technology from a 250~GeV Higgs factory, through 380 and 550~GeV, up to 10~TeV are sketched.</description>

      <title>Early Career Researcher Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update: White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>
