      <title>Polymorphic Ordinal Notations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an alternative presentation of the ordinal notation at the strength of $\Pi^1_1-CA_0$ which allows the "uncountable" notation $\Omega$ to be interpreted "polymorphically" - that is, we allow the notation to be interpreted as different cardinals depending on their context. This gives us a way to represent functions on ordinals within our ordinal notation system. We then use this idea to present an ordinal notation system for a system a bit weaker than parameter-free $\Pi^1_2-CA_0$.</description>

      <title>The Ordering Principle and Dependent Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce finite support iterations of symmetric systems, and use them to provide a strongly modernized proof of David Pincus' classical result that the axiom of dependent choice is independent over ZF with the ordering principle together with a failure of the axiom of choice.</description>

Abstract: We find a subtle modification to the construction of Chifan-Ioana-Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, which yields a drastic simplification of the proof of the existence of two non Gamma non elementarily equivalent II$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>NIP and Distal Metric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model theory, machine learning, and combinatorics each have generalizations of VC-dimension for fuzzy and real-valued versions of set systems. These different dimensions define a unique notion of a VC-class for both fuzzy sets and real-valued functions. We study these VC-classes, obtaining generalizations of certain combinatorial results from the discrete case. These include appropriate generalizations of $\varepsilon$-nets, the fractional Helly property and the $(p,q)$-theorem.
  We then apply these results to continuous logic. We prove that NIP for metric structures is equivalent to an appropriate generalization of honest definitions, which we use to study externally definable predicates and the Shelah expansion. We then examine distal metric structures, providing several equivalent characterizations, in terms of indiscernible sequences, distal types, strong honest definitions, and distal cell decompositions.</description>

      <title>The calculus of names -- The legacy of Jan {\L}ukasiewicz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With his research on Aristotle's syllogistic, Jan {\L}ukasiewicz (1934, 1939, 1957, 1963) initiates the branch of logic known as the calculus of names. This field deals with axiomatic systems that analyse various fragments of the logic of names, i.e., that branch of logic that studies various forms of names and functors acting on them, as well as logical relationships between sentences in which these names and functors occur. In this work, we want not only to present the genesis of the calculus of names and its first system created by {\L}ukasiewicz. We also want to deliver systems that extend the first. In this work, we will also show that, from the point of view of modern logic, {\L}ukasiewicz's approach to syllogistic is not the only possible one. However, this does not diminish {\L}ukasiewicz's role in the study of syllogism. We believe that the calculus of names is undoubtedly the legacy of {\L}ukasiewicz.</description>

      <title>Central H-spaces and banded types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study central types, which are generalizations of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. A type is central when it is equivalent to the component of the identity among its own self-equivalences. From centrality alone we construct an infinite delooping in terms of a tensor product of banded types, which are the appropriate notion of torsor for a central type. Our constructions are carried out in homotopy type theory, and therefore hold in any $\infty$-topos. Even when interpreted into the $\infty$-topos of spaces, our approach to constructing these deloopings is new.
  Along the way, we further develop the theory of H-spaces in homotopy type theory, including their relation to evaluation fibrations and Whitehead products. These considerations let us, for example, rule out the existence of H-space structures on the $2n$-sphere for $n &gt; 0$. We also give a novel description of the moduli space of H-space structures on an H-space. Using this description, we generalize a formula of Arkowitz-Curjel and Copeland for counting the number of path components of this moduli space. As an application, we deduce that the moduli space of H-space structures on the $3$-sphere is $\Omega^6 \mathbb{S}^3$.</description>
