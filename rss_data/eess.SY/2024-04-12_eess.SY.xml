      <title>Structured Reinforcement Learning for Media Streaming at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Media streaming is the dominant application over wireless edge (access) networks. The increasing softwarization of such networks has led to efforts at intelligent control, wherein application-specific actions may be dynamically taken to enhance the user experience. The goal of this work is to develop and demonstrate learning-based policies for optimal decision making to determine which clients to dynamically prioritize in a video streaming setting. We formulate the policy design question as a constrained Markov decision problem (CMDP), and observe that by using a Lagrangian relaxation we can decompose it into single-client problems. Further, the optimal policy takes a threshold form in the video buffer length, which enables us to design an efficient constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm to learn it. Specifically, we show that a natural policy gradient (NPG) based algorithm that is derived using the structure of our problem converges to the globally optimal policy. We then develop a simulation environment for training, and a real-world intelligent controller attached to a WiFi access point for evaluation. We empirically show that the structured learning approach enables fast learning. Furthermore, such a structured policy can be easily deployed due to low computational complexity, leading to policy execution taking only about 15$\mu$s. Using YouTube streaming experiments in a resource constrained scenario, we demonstrate that the CRL approach can increase QoE by over 30%.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Neural Network Controllers with Closed-Loop Dissipativity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a method is presented to synthesize neural network controllers such that the feedback system of plant and controller is dissipative, certifying performance requirements such as L2 gain bounds. The class of plants considered is that of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems interconnected with an uncertainty, including nonlinearities treated as an uncertainty for convenience of analysis. The uncertainty of the plant and the nonlinearities of the neural network are both described using integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). First, a dissipativity condition is derived for uncertain LTI systems. Second, this condition is used to construct a linear matrix inequality (LMI) which can be used to synthesize neural network controllers. Finally, this convex condition is used in a projection-based training method to synthesize neural network controllers with dissipativity guarantees. Numerical examples on an inverted pendulum and a flexible rod on a cart are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Deep Residual Neural Network (ResNet) Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based controllers have emerged as a tool to compensate for unstructured uncertainties in nonlinear dynamical systems. A recent breakthrough in the adaptive control literature provides a Lyapunov-based approach to derive weight adaptation laws for each layer of a fully-connected feedforward DNN-based adaptive controller. However, deriving weight adaptation laws from a Lyapunov-based analysis remains an open problem for deep residual neural networks (ResNets). This paper provides the first result on Lyapunov-derived weight adaptation for a ResNet-based adaptive controller. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence. Comparative Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed ResNet-based adaptive controller. The ResNet-based adaptive controller shows a 64% improvement in the tracking and function approximation performance, in comparison to a fully-connected DNN-based adaptive controller.</description>

      <title>Grouping of $N-1$ Contingencies for Controller Synthesis: A Study for Power Line Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of maintaining power system stability and performance after the failure of any single line in a power system (an "N-1 contingency") is investigated. Due to the large number of possible N-1 contingencies for a power network, it is impractical to optimize controller parameters for each possible contingency a priori. A method to partition a set of contingencies into groups of contingencies that are similar to each other from a control perspective is presented. Design of a single controller for each group, rather than for each contingency, provides a computationally tractable method for maintaining stability and performance after element failures. The choice of number of groups tunes a trade-off between computation time and controller performance for a given set of contingencies. Results are simulated on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems, illustrating that, with controllers designed for a relatively small number of groups, power system stability may be significantly improved after an N-1 contingency compared to continued use of the nominal controller. Furthermore, performance is comparable to that of controllers designed for each contingency individually.</description>

      <title>An advanced 1D physics-based model for PEM hydrogen fuel cells with enhanced overvoltage prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-dimensional, dynamic, two-phase, isothermal and finite-difference model of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems has been developed. It is distinct from most existing models which are either fast but imprecise, such as lumped-parameter models, or detailed but computationally intensive, such as computational fluid dynamics models. This model, partially validated using experimental polarisation curves, provides a comprehensive description of cell internal states while maintaining a low computational burden. Additionally, a new physical quantity, named the limit liquid water saturation coefficient ($s_{lim}$), is introduced in the overvoltage calculation equation. This quantity replaces the limit current density coefficient ($i_{lim}$) and establishes a connection between the voltage drop at high current densities, the amount of liquid water present in the catalyst layers of the cell, and the operating conditions. At high current densities, a significant amount of liquid water is generated, which limits the accessibility of reactants to certain triple point zones within the catalyst layers by covering them. This, in turn, increases overpotential. It has also been observed that $s_{lim}$ is influenced, at minimum, by the gas pressure imposed by the operator.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Eclipse MOSAIC for Modeling and Analyzing Ride-Hailing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-hailing services enjoy a large popularity in the sector of individualized mobility. Due to broad availability, ease of use, and competitive pricing strategies, these services have established themselves throughout the last decades. With the increased popularity, ride-hailing providers aimed to consistently improve the efficiency of their services, leading to the inception of novel research questions. Many of which can be effectively tackled using simulation. In this paper, we present such a simulation-based approach using Eclipse MOSAIC in-hand with a large-scale traffic scenario of Berlin. We analyze real-world logbook data including detailed shifts of drivers and discuss how to integrate them with the simulation scenario. Moreover, we present extensions to MOSAIC required for the modeling of the ride-hailing services, utilizing the powerful Application Simulator. Accordingly, as the primary result of this paper, we managed to extend the Eclipse MOSAIC framework to be able to answer research questions in the domain of ride-hailing and ride-sharing. Additionally, in an initial exemplary study, we analyze the traffic and environmental impacts of different, yet basic, rebalancing strategies, finding non-negligible differences in mileages and pollutant emissions. We, furthermore, applied our findings to the entire ride-hailing fleet in the city of Berlin for one year, showcasing the impacts different rebalancing strategies could have on environment and general traffic. To our knowledge, the consideration of environmental factors on a city-wide scale is a novel contribution of this paper, not addressed in previous research.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modeling and simulation of a flash clay calciner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dynamic model of a flash clay calciner. The model consists of thermophysical properties, reaction kinetics and stoichiometry, transport, mass and energy balances, and algebraic constraints. This gives rise to a system of partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAE). Spatial discretization is performed to convert the PDAEs into a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The model can be used, for example, to perform dynamic simulations with changing inputs, and process design and optimization. Moreover, it can be used to develop model-based control, which is relevant for flexible operation of a clay calcination plant for green cement production.</description>

      <title>Saturation-Informed Current-Limiting Control for Grid-Forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transient stability of a state-of-the-art grid-forming complex-droop control (i.e., dispatchable virtual oscillator control, dVOC) under current saturation. We quantify the saturation level of a converter by introducing the concept of degree of saturation (DoS), and we propose a provably stable current-limiting control with saturation-informed feedback, which feeds the degree of saturation back to the inner voltage-control loop and the outer grid-forming loop. As a result, although the output current is saturated, the voltage phase angle can still be generated from an internal virtual voltage-source node that is governed by an equivalent complex-droop control. We prove that the proposed control achieves transient stability during current saturation under grid faults. We also provide parametric stability conditions for multi-converter systems under grid-connected and islanded scenarios. The stability performance of the current-limiting control is validated with various case studies.</description>

      <title>Optimal EV Charging Scheduling at Electric Railway Stations Under Peak Load Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel Energy Management System (EMS) algorithm to achieve optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging scheduling at the parking lots of electric railway stations is proposed. The proposed approach uncovers the potential of leveraging EV charging flexibility to prevent overloading in the combined EV charging and railway operation along with renewable generation, railway regenerative capabilities, and energy storage. Specifically, to realize end-user flexibility, each EV state of charge at departure time is introduced as an optimization variable. Peak load constraints are included in the railway EMS to properly adjust EV charging requirements during periods of high railway demand. A comprehensive numerical study using a scenario-tree approach on an actual railway line in Switzerland demonstrates the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method in a practical setting under multiple scenarios.</description>

      <title>iPREFER: An Intelligent Parameter Extractor based on Features for BSIM-CMG Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative parameter extraction method for BSIM-CMG compact models, seamlessly integrating curve feature extraction and machine learning techniques. This method offers a promising solution for bridging the division between TCAD and compact model, significantly contributing to the Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) process. The key innovation lies in the development of an automated IV and CV curve feature extractor, which not only streamlines the analysis of device IV and CV curves but also enhances the consistency and efficiency of data processing. Validation on 5-nm nanosheet devices underscores the extractor's remarkable precision, with impressively low fitting errors of 0.42% for CV curves and 1.28% for IV curves. Furthermore, its adaptability to parameter variations, including those in Equivalent Oxide Thickness and Gate Length, solidifies its potential to revolutionize the TCAD-to-compact model transition. This universal BSIM-CMG model parameter extractor promises to improve the DTCO process, offering efficient process optimization and accurate simulations for semiconductor device performance prediction.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Noncooperative Duopoly Games via Event-Triggered Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for locally stable convergence to Nash equilibrium in duopoly noncooperative games based on a distributed event-triggered control scheme. The proposed approach employs extremum seeking, with sinusoidal perturbation signals applied to estimate the Gradient (first derivative) of unknown quadratic payoff functions. This is the first instance of noncooperative games being tackled in a model-free fashion integrated with the event-triggered methodology. Each player evaluates independently the deviation between the corresponding current state variable and its last broadcasted value to update the player action, while they preserve control performance under limited bandwidth of the actuation paths and still guarantee stability for the closed-loop dynamics. In particular, the stability analysis is carried out using time-scaling technique, Lyapunov's direct method and averaging theory for discontinuous systems. We quantify the size of the ultimate small residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and illustrate the theoretical results numerically on an example.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger's bridges with stopping: Steering of stochastic flows towards spatio-temporal marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating stopping (freezing) of a given stochastic flow. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) using Deepreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) is a modular framework that provides safety guarantees while planning and executing trajectories in real time via value functions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability. These value functions are computed through dynamic programming, which is notorious for being computationally inefficient. Moreover, the resulting trajectory does not adapt online to the environment, such as sudden disturbances or obstacles. DeepReach is a scalable deep learning method to HJ reachability that allows parameterization of states, which opens up possibilities for online adaptation to various controls and disturbances. In this paper, we propose Parametric FaSTrack, which uses DeepReach to approximate a value function that parameterizes the control bounds of the planning model. The new framework can smoothly trade off between the navigation speed and the tracking error (therefore maneuverability) while guaranteeing obstacle avoidance in a priori unknown environments. We demonstrate our method through two examples and a benchmark comparison with existing methods, showing the safety, efficiency, and faster solution times of the framework.</description>

      <title>EKF-SINDy: Empowering the extended Kalman filter with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed data from a dynamic system can be assimilated into a predictive model by means of Kalman filters. Nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are required to enable the joint estimation of (possibly nonlinear) system dynamics and of input parameters. To construct the evolution model used in the prediction phase of the EKF, we propose to rely on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). The numerical integration of a SINDy model leads to great computational savings compared to alternate strategies based on, e.g., finite elements. Indeed, SINDy allows for the immediate definition of the Jacobian matrices required by the EKF to identify system dynamics and properties, a derivation that is usually extremely involved with physical models. As a result, combining the EKF with SINDy provides a computationally efficient, easy-to-apply approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, capable of robust operation even outside the range of training of SINDy. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we address the identification of a linear non-autonomous system consisting of a shear building model excited by real seismograms, and the identification of a partially observed nonlinear system. The challenge arising from applying SINDy when the system state is not accessible has been relieved by means of time-delay embedding. The great accuracy and the small uncertainty associated with the state identification, where the state has been augmented to include system properties, underscores the great potential of the proposed strategy, paving the way for the development of predictive digital twins in different fields.</description>

      <title>A continuous-time violation-free multi-agent optimization algorithm and its applications to safe distributed control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a continuous-time distributed optimization algorithm with guaranteed zero coupling constraint violation and apply it to safe distributed control in the presence of multiple control barrier functions (CBF). The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Achieving violation-free distributed optimization under coupling constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction is a critical component in a wide range of engineering applications, including but not limited to safe multi-agent control and economic dispatch in power systems. This study explores violation-free distributed optimization techniques for problems characterized by separable objective functions and coupling constraints. First, we incorporate auxiliary decision variables together with a network-dependent linear mapping to each coupling constraint. For the reformulated problem, we show that the projection of its feasible set onto the space of primal variables is identical to that of the original problem, which is the key to achieving all-time constraint satisfaction. Upon treating the reformulated problem as a min-min optimization problem with respect to auxiliary and primal variables, we demonstrate that the gradients in the outer minimization problem have a locally computable closed-form. Then, two violation-free distributed optimization algorithms are developed and their convergence under reasonable assumptions is analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to implement a control barrier function based controller in a distributed manner, and the results verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Safe haptic teleoperations of admittance controlled robots with virtualization of the force feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haptic teleoperations play a key role in extending human capabilities to perform complex tasks remotely, employing a robotic system. The impact of haptics is far-reaching and can improve the sensory awareness and motor accuracy of the operator. In this context, a key challenge is attaining a natural, stable and safe haptic human-robot interaction. Achieving these conflicting requirements is particularly crucial for complex procedures, e.g. medical ones. To address this challenge, in this work we develop a novel haptic bilateral teleoperation system (HBTS), featuring a virtualized force feedback, based on the motion error generated by an admittance controlled robot. This approach allows decoupling the force rendering system from the control of the interaction: the rendered force is assigned with the desired dynamics, while the admittance control parameters are separately tuned to maximize interaction performance. Furthermore, recognizing the necessity to limit the forces exerted by the robot on the environment, to ensure a safe interaction, we embed a saturation strategy of the motion references provided by the haptic device to admittance control. We validate the different aspects of the proposed HBTS, through a teleoperated blackboard writing experiment, against two other architectures. The results indicate that the proposed HBTS improves the naturalness of teleoperation, as well as safety and accuracy of the interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) for enhanced monitoring and optimization of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs). The framework aims to investigate the utilization of massive IoT in monitoring and optimizing WDSs, with a particular focus on leakage detection, energy consumption and wireless network performance assessment in real-world water networks. The framework integrates simulation environments at both the application level (using EPANET) and the radio level (using NS-3) within the LoRaWAN network. The paper culminates with a practical use case, alongside evaluation results concerning power consumption in a large-scale LoRaWAN network and strategies for optimal gateway positioning.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Dynamics with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for learning Hamiltonian dynamics from a limited and noisy dataset is proposed. The method learns a Hamiltonian vector field on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of inherently Hamiltonian vector fields, and in particular, odd Hamiltonian vector fields. This is done with a symplectic kernel, and it is shown how the kernel can be modified to an odd symplectic kernel to impose the odd symmetry. A random feature approximation is developed for the proposed kernel to reduce the problem size. This includes random feature approximations for odd kernels. The performance of the method is validated in simulations for three Hamiltonian systems. It is demonstrated that the use of an odd symplectic kernel improves prediction accuracy, and that the learned vector fields are Hamiltonian and exhibit the imposed odd symmetry characteristics.</description>

      <title>Scenario Reduction with Guarantees for Stochastic Optimal Control of Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenario reduction algorithms can be an effective means to provide a tractable description of the uncertainty in optimal control problems. However, they might significantly compromise the performance of the controlled system. In this paper, we propose a method to compensate for the effect of scenario reduction on stochastic optimal control problems for chance-constrained linear systems with additive uncertainty. We consider a setting in which the uncertainty has a discrete distribution, where the number of possible realizations is large. We then propose a reduction algorithm with a problem-dependent loss function, and we define sufficient conditions on the stochastic optimal control problem to ensure out-of-sample guarantees (i.e., against the original distribution of the uncertainty) for the controlled system in terms of performance and chance constraint satisfaction. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven System Identification of Quadrotors Subject to Motor Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently non-linear control methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have attracted increased interest in the quadrotor control community. In contrast to classic control methods like cascaded PID controllers, MPC and RL heavily rely on an accurate model of the system dynamics. The process of quadrotor system identification is notoriously tedious and is often pursued with additional equipment like a thrust stand. Furthermore, low-level details like motor delays which are crucial for accurate end-to-end control are often neglected. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method to identify a quadrotor's inertia parameters, thrust curves, torque coefficients, and first-order motor delay purely based on proprioceptive data. The estimation of the motor delay is particularly challenging as usually, the RPMs can not be measured. We derive a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)-based method to estimate the latent time constant. Our approach only requires about a minute of flying data that can be collected without any additional equipment and usually consists of three simple maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately recover the parameters of multiple quadrotors. It also facilitates the deployment of RL-based, end-to-end quadrotor control of a large quadrotor under harsh, outdoor conditions.</description>

      <title>The Role of Confidence for Trust-based Resilient Consensus (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-agent system where agents aim to achieve a consensus despite interactions with malicious agents that communicate misleading information. Physical channels supporting communication in cyberphysical systems offer attractive opportunities to detect malicious agents, nevertheless, trustworthiness indications coming from the channel are subject to uncertainty and need to be treated with this in mind. We propose a resilient consensus protocol that incorporates trust observations from the channel and weighs them with a parameter that accounts for how confident an agent is regarding its understanding of the legitimacy of other agents in the network, with no need for the initial observation window $T_0$ that has been utilized in previous works. Analytical and numerical results show that (i) our protocol achieves a resilient consensus in the presence of malicious agents and (ii) the steady-state deviation from nominal consensus can be minimized by a suitable choice of the confidence parameter that depends on the statistics of trust observations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimization-Based Collision Avoidance For Autonomous On-Orbit Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collision avoidance constraints are prominent as non-convex, non-differentiable, and challenging when defined in optimization-based motion planning problems. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a novel non-conservative collision avoidance technique using the notion of convex optimization to establish the distance between robotic spacecraft and space structures for autonomous on-orbit assembly operations. The proposed technique defines each ellipsoidal- and polyhedral-shaped object as the union of convex compact sets, each represented non-conservatively by a real-valued convex function. Then, the functions are introduced as a set of constraints to a convex optimization problem to produce a new set of differentiable constraints resulting from the optimality conditions. These new constraints are later fed into an optimal control problem to enforce collision avoidance where the motion planning for the autonomous on-orbit assembly takes place. Numerical experiments for two assembly scenarios in tight environments are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed technique. The results show that this framework leads to optimal non-conservative trajectories for robotic spacecraft in tight environments. Although developed for autonomous on-orbit assembly, this technique could be used for any generic motion planning problem where collision avoidance is crucial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quadratic prediction error method -- i.e., nonlinear least squares -- for a class of time-varying parametric predictor models satisfying a certain identifiability condition. While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback: A Novel Formulation for Efficient Synthesis and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most existing approaches rely on expensive solvers such as sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in literature.

      <title>Damage identification of offshore jacket platforms in a digital twin framework considering optimal sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new digital twin (DT) framework with optimal sensor placement (OSP) is proposed to accurately calculate the modal responses and identify the damage ratios of the offshore jacket platforms. The proposed damage identification framework consists of two models (namely one OSP model and one damage identification model). The OSP model adopts the multi-objective Lichtenberg algorithm (MOLA) to perform the sensor number/location optimization to make a good balance between the sensor cost and the modal calculation accuracy. In the damage identification model, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-Bayesian method is developed to calculate the structural damage ratios based on the modal information obtained from the sensory measurements, where the uncertainties of the structural parameters are quantified. The proposed method is validated using an offshore jacket platform, and the analysis results demonstrate efficient identification of the structural damage location and severity.</description>

      <title>Complex-Frequency Synchronization of Converter-Based Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study phase-amplitude multivariable dynamics in converter-based power systems from a complex-frequency perspective. Complex frequency represents the rate of change of voltage amplitude and phase angle by its real and imaginary parts, respectively. This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks where active and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase-amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled (dVOC) converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dVOC and complex-power-frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria. Our study offers a practical solution to address challenging stability issues in converter-based power systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromechanical models are crucial in the design and control of motors and actuators. Modeling, identification, drive, and current control loop of a limited-rotation actuator with magnetic restoration is presented. New nonlinear and linearized electromechanical models are developed for the design of the drive as well as small and large signal controls of the actuator. To attain a higher accuracy and an efficient design, and the eddy-currents in the laminations and magnet are modeled. This involves analytically solving 1-D and 2-D diffusion equations, leading to the derivation of a lumped-element circuit for system-level analyses, such as control system design. Additionally, the study analyzes and incorporates the impact of pre-sliding friction. The actuator is prototyped, and the paper delves into the identification of the model, presenting a procedure for parameter extraction. A close agreement is observed between the results obtained from the model, finite element analysis, and experimental results. The superiority of the proposed model over previous approaches is highlighted. Part II of the paper is dedicated to the drive circuit, the current control, as well as linear and nonlinear position control system designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In part II, an op-amp-based drive is proposed and designed. Subsequently, a very accurate model for the drive circuit and the current loop is developed as a simulation platform, while its simplified version is derived, tailored for efficient design purposes. Through a comprehensive evaluation, the accuracy and efficacy of both the actuator and drive circuit modeling is scrutinized, showcasing their superiorities over existing approaches. The importance of eddy current modeling is underscored. Also, the effectiveness of the designed current loop and its practical trade-offs are engineered and discussed. Then, three DSP-based position control techniques are implemented: pole placement with voltage drive, pole placement with current drive, and nonlinear control with feed linearization. Both full-order and reduced-order observers are leveraged to estimate the unmeasured states. The performance of control designs across various applications are evaluated through indices such as rise time, overshoot, steady-state error, and large-signal tracking in the step response as well as bandwidth, robustness, phase margin, sensitivity, disturbance rejection, and noise rejection in the frequency domain. The distinctive features of implemented control strategy are compared, offering a nuanced discussion of their respective advantages and drawbacks, shedding light on their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic nonlinear MPC approximation with closed-loop guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety guarantees are vital in many control applications, such as robotics. Model predictive control (MPC) provides a constructive framework for controlling safety-critical systems, but is limited by its computational complexity. We address this problem by presenting a novel algorithm that automatically computes an explicit approximation to nonlinear MPC schemes while retaining closed-loop guarantees. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to a function approximation problem, which we then tackle by proposing ALKIA-X, the Adaptive and Localized Kernel Interpolation Algorithm with eXtrapolated reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. ALKIA-X is a non-iterative algorithm that ensures numerically well-conditioned computations, a fast-to-evaluate approximating function, and the guaranteed satisfaction of any desired bound on the approximation error. Hence, ALKIA-X automatically computes an explicit function that approximates the MPC, yielding a controller suitable for safety-critical systems and high sampling rates. We apply ALKIA-X to approximate two nonlinear MPC schemes, demonstrating reduced computational demand and applicability to realistic problems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Zeno-Free Event-Triggered Control For Multiple Networks Subject to Stochastic Network Delays and Poisson Pulsing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By designing the decentralized time-regularized (Zeno-free) event-triggered strategies for the state-feedback control law, this paper considers the stochastic stabilization of a class of networked control systems, where two sources of randomness exist in multiple decentralized networks that operate asynchronously and independently: the communication channels are constrained by the stochastic network delays and also by Poisson pulsing denial-of-service (Pp-DoS) attacks. The time delay in the network denotes the length from a transmission instant to the corresponding update instant, and is supposed to be a continuous random variable subject to certain continuous probability distribution; while the attacks' cardinal number is a discrete random variable supposed to be subject to Poisson distribution, so the inter-attack time, i.e., the time between two consecutive attack instants, is subject to exponential distribution. The considered system is modeled as a stochastic hybrid formalism, where the randomness enters through the jump map into the reset value (the inter-attack time directly related) of each triggered strategy. By only sampling/transmitting state measurements when needed and simultaneously by taking the specific medium access protocols into account, the designed event-triggered strategies are synthesized in a state-based and decentralized form, which are robust (tolerable well) to stochastic network delays, under different tradeoff-conditions between the minimum inter-event times, maximum allowable delays (i.e., potentially tolerable delays) and the frequencies of attacks. Using stochastic hybrid tools to combine attack-active parts with attack-over parts, the designed triggered strategies, if designed well according to the actual system needs, can tolerate (be resilient to) the Pp-DoS attacks and stochastic network delays without jeopardizing the stability and Zeno-freeness.</description>

      <title>Local Observability of VINS and LINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes unobservable directions of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS) and Lidar-aided Inertial Navigation System (LINS) nonlinear model. Under the assumption that there exist two features observed by the camera without occlusion, the unobservable directions of VINS are uniformly globally translation and global rotations about the gravity vector. The unobservable directions of LINS are same as VINS, while only one feature need to be observed. Also, a constraint in Observability-Constrained VINS (OC-VINS) is proved.</description>

      <title>Ex Post Conditions for the Exactness of Optimal Power Flow Conic Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem provide an efficient alternative to solving the intractable alternating current (AC) optimal power flow. The conic subset of OPF convex relaxations, in particular, greatly accelerate resolution while leading to high-quality approximations that are exact in several scenarios. However, the sufficient conditions guaranteeing exactness are stringent, e.g., requiring radial topologies. In this short communication, we present two equivalent ex post conditions for the exactness of any conic relaxation of the OPF. These rely on obtaining either a rank-1 voltage matrix or self-coherent cycles. Instead of relying on sufficient conditions a priori, satisfying one of the presented ex post conditions acts as an exactness certificate for the computed solution. The operator can therefore obtain an optimality guarantee when solving a conic relaxation even when a priori exactness requirements are not met. Finally, we present numerical examples from the MATPOWER library where the ex post conditions hold even though the exactness sufficient conditions do not, thereby illustrating the use of the conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Control For Multi-Agent Capacity-Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven hierarchical control scheme for managing a fleet of nonlinear, capacity-constrained autonomous agents in an iterative environment. We propose a control framework consisting of a high-level dynamic task assignment and routing layer and low-level motion planning and tracking layer. Each layer of the control hierarchy uses a data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy, maintaining bounded computational complexity at each calculation of a new task assignment or actuation input. We utilize collected data to iteratively refine estimates of agent capacity usage, and update MPC policy parameters accordingly. Our approach leverages tools from iterative learning control to integrate learning at both levels of the hierarchy, and coordinates learning between levels in order to maintain closed-loop feasibility and performance improvement of the connected architecture.</description>

      <title>Potentials of the Metaverse for Robotized Applications in Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a digital environment of interconnected virtual ecosystems driven by measured and synthesized data, the Metaverse has so far been mostly considered from its gaming perspective that closely aligns with online edutainment. Although it is still in its infancy and more research as well as standardization efforts remain to be done, the Metaverse could provide considerable advantages for smart robotized applications in the industry.Workflow efficiency, collective decision enrichment even for executives, as well as a natural, resilient, and sustainable robotized assistance for the workforce are potential advantages. Hence, the Metaverse could consolidate the connection between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. This paper identifies and puts forward potential advantages of the Metaverse for robotized applications and highlights how these advantages support goals pursued by the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 visions.

      <title>Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</description>

      <title>Peak Time-Windowed Risk Estimation of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a method to upper-bound extreme-values of time-windowed risks for stochastic processes. Examples of such risks include the maximum average or 90% quantile of the current along a transmission line in any 5-minute window. This work casts the time-windowed risk analysis problem as an infinite-dimensional linear program in occupation measures. In particular, we employ the coherent risk measures of the mean and the expected shortfall (conditional value at risk) to define the maximal time-windowed risk along trajectories. The infinite-dimensional linear program must then be truncated into finite-dimensional optimization problems, such as by using the moment-sum of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The infinite-dimensional linear program will have the same optimal value as the original nonconvex risk estimation task under compactness and regularity assumptions, and the sequence of semidefinite programs will converge to the true value under additional properties of algebraic characterization. The scheme is demonstrated for risk analysis of example stochastic processes.</description>
