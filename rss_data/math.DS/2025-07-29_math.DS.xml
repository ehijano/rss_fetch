      <title>Synchronization and Applications of Piecewise Recursive Sequences with Dynamic Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate piecewise recursive sequences where both the sequence and its switching threshold evolve dynamically. We consider coupled evolution: $a_{n+1} = f(a_n)$ if $a_n \leq c_n$, otherwise $a_{n+1} = g(a_n)$, with threshold $c_{n+1} = h(a_n, c_n)$. Our analysis reveals that when an orbit switches between regimes infinitely often and both sequences converge, they appear to converge to the same limit (Common Limit Theorem). For linear systems, we identify five possible dynamical behaviors: convergence, bistability, periodic orbits, spirals, and chaos. We explore convergence conditions using contraction principles and monotone threshold evolution, though examples suggest that component-wise contraction may be insufficient. An application to central bank monetary policy offers one possible explanation for the observed convergence of inflation and intervention criteria above target.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the spectral radius of locally constant strongly irreducible cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish some conditions under which $\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R})$-valued cocycles over a subshift of finite type, equipped with an equilibrium state, exhibit exponential asymptotics for the spectral radius. Specifically, we show that the exponential growth rate of the spectral radius converges to the top Lyapunov exponent of the cocycle. This result provides a partial answer to a question posed by Aoun and Sert in \cite{aoun}. Our approach relies on large deviation estimates for linear cocycles, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Structural Identifiability and Discrete Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the use of symmetries for analysing the structural identifiability and observability of control systems. Special emphasis is put on the role of discrete symmetries, in contrast to the more commonly studied continuous or Lie symmetries. We argue that discrete symmetries are the origin of parameters which are structurally locally identifiable, but not globally. We exploit this fact to present a methodology for structural identifiability analysis that detects such parameters and characterizes the symmetries in which they are involved. We demonstrate the use of our methodology by applying it to four case studies.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Estimation of Alzheimer's Disease Incidence from Dynamic Population Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-stage methodology for reconstructing Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence over time using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) applied to mortality data. In the first stage, we use EKI to infer temporal trends in all-cause and Alzheimer's-specific mortality by fitting an age-structured demographic model to observed death counts. This yields posterior estimates of evolving population structure and age-specific AD mortality rates. In the second stage, we apply a back-calculation procedure that uses these estimates, along with the hazard of AD-related death following disease onset, to infer time- and age-specific incidence rates. This reverse-inference framework enables the reconstruction of latent disease dynamics in the absence of direct incidence surveillance. By integrating demographic structure, disease-specific hazards, and observed mortality into a coherent inferential pipeline, our approach offers a principled and flexible tool for monitoring chronic disease trends and estimating historical disease burden.</description>

      <title>Operator Inference Aware Quadratic Manifolds with Isotropic Reduced Coordinates for Nonintrusive Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction error alone.</description>

Abstract: On the 3-dimensional fractional-order Toda lattice with two controls
  The main purpose of this paper is to study the fractional-order system with Caputo derivative associated to 3-dimensional Toda lattice with two controls.

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09840v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>On finite $\beta$-expansions for the set of natural numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the problem of finiteness of the $\beta$-expansions for the set of natural numbers, condition $F_1$ in brief, for three families of Pisot numbers for which the $\beta$-expansion of 1 is not a non-decreasing sequence. We show a class of simple $\beta$-numbers which display a puzzling behaviour, in the sense that an infinite subset of such $\beta$ satisfy $F_1$, whereas a complementary infinite subset does not. This puzzle is organized by the residue class modulo 3 of an integer coefficient of the main family of polynomials discussed. We prove that, when $F_1$ does not hold, the complement of ${{\rm Fin}(\beta)}$ is infinite. Finally, we give a concise sufficient condition for $F_1$, which is the finitude of the $\beta$-expansion of $(\beta-\lfloor \beta\rfloor)^2$.</description>

      <title>Long-Duration Station-Keeping Strategy for Cislunar Spacecraft Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel guidance and control strategy for cislunar near-rectilinear halo orbit formation-keeping applied to high-fidelity dynamics. Bounded relative motion is constructed about long-duration ephemeris trajectories with osculating invariant circles to form quasi-periodic relative orbits. State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight. The strategy is verified in high-fidelity simulation environments through Monte Carlo trials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Benoist-Hulin group is, by definition, a subgroup $\Gamma$ of ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ such that any $\Gamma$-invariant closed set consisting of Jordan curves in the space of closed subsets of the Riemann sphere that are not singletons is composed of $K$-quasicircles for some $K \ge 1$. Y.Benoist and D.Hulin showed that the full group ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ is a Benoist-Hulin group. In this paper, we develop the theory of Benoist-Hulin groups and show that both uniform lattices and parabolic subgroups are Benoist-Hulin groups.</description>

      <title>On Certificates for Almost Sure Reachability in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost sure reachability refers to the property of a stochastic system whereby, from any initial condition, the system state reaches a given target set with probability one. In this paper, we study the problem of certifying almost sure reachability in discrete-time stochastic systems using drift and variant conditions. While these conditions are both necessary and sufficient in theory, computational approaches often rely on restricting the search to fixed templates, such as polynomial or quadratic functions. We show that this restriction compromises completeness: there exists a polynomial system for which a given target set is almost surely reachable but admits no polynomial certificate, and a linear system for which a neighborhood of the origin is almost surely reachable but admits no quadratic certificate. We then provide a complete characterization of reachability certificates for linear systems with additive noise. Our analysis yields conditions on the system matrices under which valid certificates exist, and shows how the structure and dimension of the system determine the need for non-quadratic templates. Our results generalize the classical random walk behavior to a broader class of stochastic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>PySHRED: A Python package for SHallow REcurrent Decoding for sparse sensing, model reduction and scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) provide a deep learning strategy for modeling high-dimensional dynamical systems and/or spatiotemporal data from dynamical system snapshot observations. PySHRED is a Python package that implements SHRED and several of its major extensions, including for robust sensing, reduced order modeling and physics discovery. In this paper, we introduce the version 1.0 release of PySHRED, which includes data preprocessors and a number of cutting-edge SHRED methods specifically designed to handle real-world data that may be noisy, multi-scale, parameterized, prohibitively high-dimensional, and strongly nonlinear. The package is easy to install, thoroughly-documented, supplemented with extensive code examples, and modularly-structured to support future additions. The entire codebase is released under the MIT license and is available at https://github.com/pyshred-dev/pyshred.</description>

      <title>Contribution of the 2021 COVID-19 Vaccination Regime to COVID-19 Transmission and Control in South Africa: A Mathematical Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study assesses the impact of COVID-19 vaccines through an epidemiological model that quantifies their role in pandemic control. We analyze an SIR-based model incorporating vaccination effects and calculate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$. Our findings indicate that under conditions of imperfect vaccination and non-permanent immunity from recovery, a backward bifurcation may occur when $\mathcal{R}_0&lt;1$. Conversely, with full immunity from vaccination and lasting immunity post-recovery, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for $\mathcal{R}_0&lt;1$. Numerical simulations support these theoretical results. The model is calibrated using South African data from Johns Hopkins University, covering the period from February 17 to August 5, 2021. Results show that vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was below 50\%, consistent with the CDC's February 2024 report indicating an improved infection-protection rate of 54\% for newly produced vaccines. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that vaccines significantly enhanced recovery rates and reduced both mortality and recovery time, aligning with CDC reports. A sensitivity analysis highlights key parameters affecting $\mathcal{R}_0$, offering insights for policymakers on optimizing vaccination strategies.</description>

      <title>Classifying Stein's groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of Stein's groups, which generalize the well-known Higman-Thompson groups. Stein's groups are defined as groups of piecewise linear bijections of an interval with finitely many breakpoints and slopes belonging to specified additive and multiplicative subgroups of the real numbers. Our main result establishes a classification theorem for these groups under the assumptions that the slope group is finitely generated and the additive group has rank at least 2. We achieve this by interpreting Stein's groups as topological full groups of ample groupoids. A central concept in our analysis is the notion of $H^1$-rigidity in the cohomology of groupoids. In the case where the rank of the additive group is 1, we adopt a different approach using attracting elements to impose strong constraints on the classification.</description>

      <title>On convergence of Thurston's iteration for entire functions with an infinite set of marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to generalize Thurston's Topological Characterization of Rational Functions to the setting when both the covering degree and the set of marked points are infinite. A relevant class of branched coverings are transcendental entire functions with finitely many singular values whose orbits escape to (or, more generally, accumulate ``near'') $\infty$. Given a branched covering $f$ mimicking such post-singular behaviour, one wants to decide whether it is Thurston equivalent to an entire function. The answer is positive for a big class of entire function and generic escaping singular orbits.
  As in the Thurston's theorem, the problem reduces to the study of the pull-back map $\sigma$ defined on the corresponding Teichm\"uller space. But, unlike in the rational case, the space is infinite-dimensional and the branching structure near $\infty$ (which is essential singularity) is much more subtle depending on the family of functions under consideration. A general approach is possible for entire functions defined by asymptotic area property introduced in the article. Roughly, it implies that asymptotic tracts fill all space near $\infty$ even when their range shrinks.
  The main result provides a sufficient condition for existence in the Teichm\"uller space of a $\sigma$-invariant subset which looks like a finite-dimensional compact: forgetting marked infinite tails of every orbit yields a compact set, while forgetting a long enough initial part of every orbit yields a small perturbation of the identity homeomorphism. The statement remains valid even in case of non-escaping unbounded singular orbits and allows to deduce existence of a fixed point of $\sigma$ in many relevant cases.</description>

      <title>Coarse chain recurrence, Morse graphs with finite errors, and persistence of circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a topological framework to describe global dynamics under finite-energy perturbations, focusing on escapes from attracting basins, elimination of stagnation, and persistence of recurrent behaviors governed by finite total or stepwise energy. To this end, we introduce generalized concepts of chain recurrence and construct corresponding filtrations for dynamical systems on metric spaces. These filtrations refine Conley's classical theory and enable the quantitative modeling of dynamical behaviors under bounded energy inputs. In particular, we introduce concepts of "coarse chain recurrences" and Morse graphs with finite errors, which yield bifurcation diagrams depicting how chain recurrent components evolve as perturbation scales increase. Our framework also reveals singular limits, where the total injected energy vanishes. The framework applies to both maps and semiflows, providing tools to analyze robustness, sensitivity, and structural evolution of recurrent dynamics. Applications include toy models of flow control and circulation maintained under finite-energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical closure of partial differential equations with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the dynamical closure of spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations. Employing the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics to embed the original classical dynamics into an infinite dimensional quantum mechanical system, we use the space of quantum states to model the unresolved degrees of freedom of the original dynamics and the framework of quantum measurement to predict their contributions to the resolved dynamics. The embedded dynamics is projected to finite dimension by a positivity preserving discretization process. Based on methods from operator valued kernels and delay embedding, the compressed finite dimensional representation of the dynamics is invariant under the spatial symmetries of the original dynamics. We develop a data driven formulation of the scheme that can be realized numerically and apply it to a dynamical closure problem for the shallow water equations. The results demonstrate that our closure model can accurately predict the main features of the true dynamics, including for out of sample initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a general rational function $A$ of degree $m \geq 2$, any decomposition of its iterate $A^{\circ n}$, $n \geq 1$, into a composition of indecomposable rational functions is equivalent to the decomposition $A^{\circ n}$ itself. As an application, we prove that if $(A_1, A_2)$ is a general pair of rational functions, then the endomorphism of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ given by $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (A_1(z_1), A_2(z_2))$ admits a periodic curve that is neither a vertical nor a horizontal line if and only if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are conjugate.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal SEIQR Epidemic Modeling with Optimal Control for Vaccination, Treatment, and Social Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spatiotemporal SEIQR epidemic model governed by a system of reaction-diffusion partial differential equations that incorporates optimal control strategies. The model captures the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease across space and time. It includes three time-dependent control variables: preventive measures for susceptible individuals, quarantine for infectious individuals, and treatment for quarantined individuals. The study has four main objectives: (i) to prove the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of global strong solutions using analytic semigroup theory, (ii) to demonstrate the existence of optimal control strategies through functional analysis techniques, (iii) to derive first-order necessary optimality conditions via convex perturbation methods and adjoint equations, and (iv) to perform numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of different combinations of control interventions. The simulation results emphasize the advantages of combining pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to minimize disease prevalence and control-related expenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider finitely many maps, all of which are defined on a smooth compact measure space, with at least one map in the collection having degree strictly bigger than 1. Working with random dynamics generated by this setting, we obtain an expression for the extremal Lyapunov exponents, that characterise the instability of typical orbits, as the limit of the averages of the logarithm of the operator norm of linear cocycles of generic orbits. We obtain this as a consequence to the Kingman's ergodic theorem for a subadditive sequence of measurable functions, which naturally generalises the Birkhoff's ergodic theorem.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical measures for complex hyperbolic quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study semiclassical measures for Laplacian eigenfunctions on compact complex hyperbolic quotients. Geodesic flows on these quotients are a model case of hyperbolic dynamical systems with different expansion/contraction rates in different directions. We show that the support of any semiclassical measure is either equal to the entire cosphere bundle or contains the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic complex submanifold.
  The proof uses the one-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Bourgain-Dyatlov [arXiv:1612.09040] along the fast expanding/contracting directions, in a way similar to the work of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] in the toy model of quantum cat maps, together with a description of the closures of fast unstable/stable trajectories relying on Ratner theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of the topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M, \tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace-preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (A, \tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, any $\Gamma$-invariant amenable intermediate subalgebra between $A$ and $\Gamma \ltimes A$ is necessarily a subalgebra of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma) \ltimes A$. By taking $(A, \tau_A) = L^\infty(X, \nu_X)$ for a free pmp action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (X, \nu_X)$, we obtain a similar result for the invariant subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation of log-affine models using detailed-balanced reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the escaping set of certain H\'enon maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a H\'enon map of the form $H(x,y)=(y,p(y)-ax)$. We prove that the escaping set $U^+$ (or equivalently, the non-escaping set $K^+$), of $H$ is rigid under the actions of automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ if the degree of $H=d\le |a|$. Specifically, every automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that preserves $U^+$, essentially takes the form $C \circ H^s$ where $s \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $C(x,y)=(\eta x, \eta^d y)$ with $\eta$ some $(d^2-1)$-root of unity.
  Consequently, we show that the automorphisms of the short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s, obtained as the sub-level sets of the (positive) Green's function corresponding to the H\'enon map $H$ for strictly positive values, are essentially linear maps of $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserving the escaping set $U^+$. Hence, the automorphism groups of these short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s are the same, finite, and form a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{d^2-1}$.</description>

      <title>Matrix nearness problems and eigenvalue optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is about solving matrix nearness problems that are related to eigenvalues or singular values or pseudospectra. These problems arise in great diversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of robust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of clustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix perturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients to desired locations.
  Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or are projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed sparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1 perturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner iteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is to be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This amounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two vectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration determines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear equation.
  A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory Chapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its nontrivial extensions.</description>

      <title>A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network to Realize States of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is rapidly evolving and places a new perspective on realizing state-space dynamical systems. However, dynamical systems derived from nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suffer from limitations in computational efficiency. Thus, this paper stems from data-driven learning to advance states of dynamical systems utilizing a structured neural network (StNN). The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal, low-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel operator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based on the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing data-driven techniques. We show that the proposed StNN reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity compared with the conventional neural networks and also with the classical data-driven techniques, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and Hankel Alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK), which is commonly known as delay-Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD) or Hankel-DMD. More specifically, we present numerical simulations to solve dynamical systems utilizing the StNN based on the Hankel operator beginning from the fundamental Lotka-Volterra model, where we compare the StNN with the LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), and extend our analysis to highly nonlinear and chaotic Lorenz systems, comparing the StNN with conventional neural networks, SINDy, and HAVOK. Hence, we show that the proposed StNN paves the way for realizing state-space dynamical systems with a low-complexity learning algorithm, enabling prediction and understanding of future states.</description>
