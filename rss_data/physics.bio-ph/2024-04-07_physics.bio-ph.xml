      <title>Conditions on detecting tripartite entangled state in psychophysical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07446</link>

Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity of the human visual system to quantum entangled light. We examine the possibility of human subjects perceiving multipartite entangled state through psychophysical experiments. Our focus begins with a bipartite entangled state to make a comparative study with the literature by taking into account additive noise for false positive on bipartite entanglement perception by humans. After that, we limit our similar investigation to a tripartite entangled state for simplicity in higher dimensions. To model the photodetection by humans, we employ the probability of seeing determined for coherently amplified photons in Fock number states, including an additive noise. Our results indicate that detecting bipartite and tripartite entanglement with the human eye is possible for a certain range of additive noise levels and visual thresholds. Finally, we discuss several alternative amplification methods.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>

      <title>Collective deformation modes promote fibrous self-assembly in protein-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-assembly of particles into organized structures is a key feature of living organisms and a major engineering challenge. While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-pieces-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. Besides, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiber-like. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic protein characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.</description>

      <title>How motility drives the glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes glass transition between solid-like jammed and fluid-like flowing states. During some of these processes, the cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT): they acquire in-plane polarity and become motile. Thus, how motility drives the glassy dynamics in epithelial systems is critical for the EMT process. However, no analytical framework that is indispensable for deeper insights exists. Here, we develop such a theory inspired by a well-known glass theory. One crucial result of this work is that the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of active force, described by its rotational diffusivity, $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ differs from the bare rotational diffusivity, $D_r$, of the motile force due to cell shape dynamics, which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We test the theoretical prediction of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ and how it affects the relaxation dynamics in our simulations of active Vertex model. This novel effect of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is crucial to understanding the new and previously published simulation data of active glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers.</description>
