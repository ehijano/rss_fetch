      <title>The Role of Thermal Feedback in the Growth of Planetary Cores by Pebble Accretion in Dust Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution millimetre-imaging of protoplanetary discs has revealed many containing rings and gaps. These rings can contain large quantities of dust, often in excess of 10M$_\oplus$, providing prime sites for efficient and rapid planet formation. Rapid planet formation will produce high accretion luminosities, heating the surrounding disc. We investigate the importance of a planetary embryo's accretion luminosity by simulating the dynamics of the gas and dust in a dust ring, accounting for the energy liberated as a resident planetary embryo accretes. The resulting heating alters the flow structure near the planet, increasing the accretion rate of large, millimetre-to-centimetre-sized dust grains. We show how this process varies with the mass of dust in the ring and the local background gas temperature, demonstrating that the thermal feedback always acts to increase the planet's mass. This increase in planet mass is driven primarily by the formation of vortices, created by a baroclinic instability once the accreting planet heats the disc significantly outside its Hill radius. The vortices can then migrate with respect to the planet, resulting in a complex interplay between planetary growth, gap-opening, dust trapping and vortex dynamics. Planets formed within dust traps can have masses that exceed the classical pebble isolation mass, potentially providing massive seeds for the future formation of giant planets. Once pebble accretion ceases, the local dust size distribution is depleted in large grains, and much of the remaining dust mass is trapped in the system's L$_5$ Lagrange point, providing potentially observable signatures of this evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like planet with a basal magma ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's geodynamo has operated for over 3.5 billion years. The magnetic field is currently powered by thermocompositional convection in the outer core, which involves the release of light elements and latent heat as the inner core solidifies. However, since the inner core nucleated no more than 1.5 billion years ago, the early dynamo could not rely on these buoyancy sources. Given recent estimates of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, an alternative mechanism may be required to sustain the geodynamo prior to nucleation of the inner core. One possibility is a silicate dynamo operating in a long-lived basal magma ocean. Here, we investigate the structural, thermal, buoyancy, and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. Using modern equations of state and melting curves, we include a time-dependent parameterization of the compositional evolution of an iron-rich basal magma ocean. We combine an internal structure integration of the planet with energy budgets in a coupled core, basal magma ocean, and mantle system. We determine the thermocompositional convective stability of the core and the basal magma ocean, and assess their respective dynamo activity using entropy budgets and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Our conservative nominal model predicts a transient basal magma ocean dynamo followed by a core dynamo after 1 billion years. The model is sensitive to several parameters, including the initial temperature of the core-mantle boundary, the parameterization of mantle convection, the composition of the basal magma ocean, the radiogenic content of the planet, as well as convective velocity and magnetic scaling laws. We use the nominal model to constrain the range of basal magma ocean electrical conductivity and core thermal conductivity that sustain a dynamo.</description>

      <title>Short-Timescale Spatial Variability of Ganymede's Optical Aurora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ganymede's aurora are the product of complex interactions between its intrinsic magnetosphere and the surrounding Jovian plasma environment and can be used to derive both atmospheric composition and density. In this study, we analyzed a time-series of Ganymede's optical aurora taken with Keck I/HIRES during eclipse by Jupiter on 2021-06-08 UTC, one day after the Juno flyby of Ganymede. The data had sufficient signal-to-noise in individual 5-minute observations to allow for the first high cadence analysis of the spatial distribution of the aurora brightness and the ratio between the 630.0 and 557.7 nm disk-integrated auroral brightnesses -- a quantity diagnostic of the relative abundances of O, O$_2$ and H$_2$O in Ganymede's atmosphere. We found that the hemisphere closer to the centrifugal equator of Jupiter's magnetosphere (where electron number density is highest) was up to twice as bright as the opposing hemisphere. The dusk (trailing) hemisphere, subjected to the highest flux of charged particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, was also consistently almost twice as bright as the dawn (leading) hemisphere. We modeled emission from simulated O$_2$ and H$_2$O atmospheres during eclipse and found that if Ganymede hosts an H$_2$O sublimation atmosphere in sunlight, it must collapse on a faster timescale than expected to explain its absence in our data given our current understanding of Ganymede's surface properties.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of Apophis' 2029 Earth approach to small asteroid impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apophis' current trajectory takes it safely past our planet at a distance of several Earth radii on 2029 April 13. Here the possibility is considered that Apophis could collide with a small asteroid, like the ones that frequently and unpredictably strike Earth, and the resulting perturbation of its trajectory. The probability of an impact that could significantly displace Apophis relative to its keyholes is found to be less than 1 in $10^6$, requiring a delta-v greater than 0.3 mm/s, while for an impact that could significantly displace Apophis compared to its miss distance in 2029 it is less than 1 in $10^9$, requiring a delta-v greater than 5 cm/s. These probabilities are below the usual thresholds considered by asteroid impact warning systems.
  Apophis is in the daytime sky and unobservable from mid-2021 to 2027. It will be challenging to determine from single night observations in 2027 if Apophis has moved on the target plane enough to enter a dangerous keyhole, as the deviation from the nominal ephemeris might be only a few tenths of an arcsecond. An impending Earth impact would, however, be signalled clearly in most cases by deviations of tens of arcseconds of Apophis from its nominal ephemeris in 2027. Thus most of the impact risk could be retired by a single observation of Apophis in 2027, though a minority of cases present some ambiguity and are discussed in more detail. Charts of the on-sky position of Apophis under different scenarios are presented for quick assessment by observers.</description>

      <title>Y Dwarfs: The Challenge of Discovering the Coldest Substellar Population in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form in the Galaxy with a wide range in mass. If the mass is below 7% of the Sun's, then the object does not become hot enough for stable hydrogen burning. These substellar objects are called brown dwarfs. Maps of the sky at infrared wavelengths have found large numbers of brown dwarfs. However only 24 objects have been found (as of April 2017) that are cold enough to be classified as "Y dwarfs": these have atmospheres that are cooler than 500 K (or 200 C, 400 F) and have masses only 5 - 20 times that of Jupiter. The coolest Y dwarf currently known, discovered in 2014, has a temperature around freezing, has a mass of about 5 Jupiter masses, and is only 2 pc away from the Sun. These small and cold objects are faint and difficult to find. This chapter describes the discovery and characterization of the Y dwarfs. Finding more of these very cold planet-like brown dwarfs will require an as-yet unplanned space mission mapping large areas of sky at wavelengths around 5 microns.</description>

      <title>FAST Observations of Four Comets to Search for the Molecular Line Emissions between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for the molecular emissions in the L-band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz toward four comets, C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), C/2020 R4 (ATLAS), C/2021 A1 (Leonard), and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during or after their perihelion passages. Thousands of molecular transition lines fall in this low-frequency range, many attributed to complex organic or prebiotic molecules. We conducted a blind search for the possible molecular lines in this frequency range in those comets and could not identify clear signals of molecular emissions in the data. Although several molecules have been detected at high frequencies of great than 100 GHz in comets, our results confirm that it is challenging to detect molecular transitions in the L-band frequency ranges. The non-detection of L-band molecular lines in the cometary environment could rule out the possibility of unusually strong lines, which could be caused by the masers or non-LTE effects. Although the line strengths are predicted to be weak, for FAST, using the ultra-wide bandwidth receiver and improving the radio frequency interference environments would enhance the detectability of those molecular transitions at low frequencies in the future.</description>

      <title>Volatile-rich Sub-Neptunes as Hydrothermal Worlds: The Case of K2-18 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperate exoplanets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune, known as "sub-Neptunes", have emerged as intriguing targets for astrobiology. It is unknown whether these planets resemble Earth-like terrestrial worlds with a habitable surface, Neptune-like giant planets with deep atmospheres and no habitable surface, or something exotic in between. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of the canonical sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed ~1% CH4, ~1% CO2, and a non-detection of CO in the atmosphere. While previous studies have proposed that the observed atmospheric composition could help constrain the lower atmosphere conditions and determine the interior structure of sub-Neptunes like K2-18 b, the possible interactions between the atmosphere and a hot, supercritical water ocean at its base remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether a global supercritical water ocean, resembling a planetary-scale hydrothermal system, can explain these observations on K2-18 b-like sub-Neptunes through equilibrium aqueous geochemical calculations. We find that the observed atmospheric CH4/CO2 ratio implies a minimum ocean temperature of ~715 K, whereas the corresponding CO/CO2 ratio allows ocean temperatures up to ~1060 K. These results indicate that a global supercritical water ocean on K2-18 b is plausible. While life cannot survive in this ocean, this work represents the first step towards understanding how a global supercritical water ocean may influence observable atmospheric characteristics on volatile-rich sub-Neptunes. Future observations with better constrained NH3 and CO mixing ratios could further help distinguish between possible interior compositions of K2-18 b.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of a protoplanetary disk: combining observations, simulations and cosmochemical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a plausible and coherent view of the evolution of the protosolar disk that is consistent with the cosmochemical constraints and compatible with observations of other protoplanetary disks and sophisticated numerical simulations. The evidence that high-temperature condensates, CAIs and AOAs, formed near the protosun before being transported to the outer disk can be explained by either an early phase of vigorous radial spreading of the disk, or fast transport of these condensates from the vicinity of the protosun towards large disk radii via the protostellar outflow. The assumption that the material accreted towards the end of the infall phase was isotopically distinct allows us to explain the observed dichotomy in nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies of meteorites and leads to intriguing predictions on the isotopic composition of refractory elements in comets. When the infall of material waned, the disk started to evolve as an accretion disk. Initially, dust drifted inwards, shrinking the radius of the dust component to ~ 45 au, probably about 1/2 of the width of the gas component. Then structures must have emerged, producing a series of pressure maxima in the disk which trapped the dust on My timescales. This allowed planetesimals to form at radically distinct times without changing significantly of isotopic properties. There was no late accretion of material onto the disk via streamers. The disk disappeared in ~5 Myr, as indicated by paleomagnetic data in meteorites. In conclusion, the evolution of the protosolar disk seems to have been quite typical in terms of size, lifetime, and dust behavior, suggesting that the peculiarities of the Solar system with respect to extrasolar planetary system probably originate from the chaotic nature of planet formation and not at the level of the parental disk.</description>

      <title>New evidence supporting past dust ejections from active asteroid (4015) Wilson-Harrington</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. (4015) Wilson-Harrington (hereafter, WH) was discovered as a comet in 1949 but has a dynamical property consistent with that of a near-Earth asteroid. Although there is a report that the 1949 activity is associated with an ion tail, the cause of the activity has not yet been identified. Aims. This work aims to reveal the mysterious comet-like activity of the near-Earth asteroid. Methods. We conducted new polarimetric observations of WH from May 2022 to January 2023, reanalyses of the photographic plate images taken at the time of its discovery in 1949, and dust tail simulation modelings, where the dust terminal velocity and ejection epoch are taken into account. Results. We found that this object shows polarization characteristics similar to those of low-albedo asteroids. We derived the geometric albedo ranging from pV = 0.076 +- 0.010 to pV = 0.094 +- 0.018 from our polarimetry (the values vary depending on the data used for fitting and the slope-albedo relationship coefficients). In addition, the 1949 image showed an increase in brightness around the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that the color of the tail is consistent with sunlight, suggesting that the 1949 activity is associated with dust ejection. From the dust tail analysis, ~9 x 10^5 kg of material was ejected episodically at a low velocity equivalent to or even slower than the escape velocity. Conclusions. We conclude that WH is most likely an active asteroid of main belt origin and that the activity in 1949 was likely triggered by mass shedding due to fast rotation.</description>

      <title>Analytical theory of the spin-orbit state of a binary asteroid deflected by a kinetic impactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the perturbed-from-synchronous librational state of a double asteroid, modeled by the Full Two Rigid Body Problem (F2RBP), with primary emphasis on deriving analytical formulas which describe the system's evolution after deflection by a kinetic impactor. To this end, both a linear and nonlinear (canonical) theory are developed. We make the simplifying approximations (to be relaxed in a forthcoming paper) of planar binary orbit and axisymmetric shape of the primary body. To study the effect of a DART-like hit on the secondary body, the momentum transfer enhancement parameter $\beta$ is introduced and retained as a symbolic variable throughout all formulas derived, either by linear or nonlinear theory. Our approach can be of use in the context of the analysis of the post impact data from kinetic impactor missions, by providing a precise modeling of the impactor's effect on the seconadry's librational state as a function of $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Bulk and atmospheric metallicities as direct probes of sequentially varying accretion mechanisms of gas and solids onto planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core accretion is the standard scenario of planet formation, wherein planets are formed by sequential accretion of gas and solids, and is widely used to interpret exoplanet observations. However, no direct probes of the scenario have been discussed yet. Here, we introduce an onion-like model as one idealization of sequential accretion and propose that bulk and atmospheric metallicities of exoplanets can be used as direct probes of the process. Our analytical calculations, coupled with observational data, demonstrate that the trend of observed exoplanets supports the sequential accretion hypothesis. In particular, accretion of planetesimals that are $\gtrsim $ 100 km in size is most favored to consistently explain the observed trends. The importance of opening gaps in both planetesimal and gas disks following planetary growth is also identified. New classification is proposed, wherein most observed planets are classified into two interior statuses: globally mixed and locally (well-)mixed. Explicit identification of the locally (well-)mixed status enables reliable verification of sequential accretion. During the JWST era, the quality and volume of observational data will increase drastically and improve exoplanet characterization. This work provides one key reference of how both the bulk and atmospheric metallicities can be used to constrain gas and solid accretion mechanisms of planets.</description>

      <title>Slow Rotation for the Super-Puff Planet Kepler-51d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-puffs are low-density planets of unknown origin and composition. If they form by accreting nebular gas through a circumplanetary disk, one might expect super-puffs to be spinning quickly. Here, we derive upper limits on the rotational oblateness of the super-puff Kepler-51d, based on precise transit observations with the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. The absence of detectable oblateness-related anomalies in the light curve leads to an upper limit of about $0.15$ on the planet's sky-projected oblateness. Assuming the sky-projected oblateness to be representative of the true oblateness, the rotation period of Kepler-51d is $\gtrsim 40$ hours, or equivalently, its rotation speed is $\lesssim 42\%$ of the breakup speed. Alternatively, if the apparently low density of Kepler-51d is due to an opaque planetary ring, the ring must be oriented within $27\deg$ of face-on and have an inner radius smaller than $1.2$ times the planet's radius. The lack of anomalies exceeding $0.01\%$ in the ingress and egress portions of the light curve also places a constraint on the model of Wang &amp; Dai, in which the planet's apparently low density is due to a dusty outflowing atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Simulated performance of energy-resolving detectors towards exoplanet imaging with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary science goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as defined by the Astro2020 decadal survey is the imaging of the first Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star. A key technology gap towards reaching this goal are the development of ultra-low-noise photon counting detectors capable of measuring the incredibly low count rates coming from these planets which are at contrasts of $\sim 1 \times 10^{-10}$. Superconducting energy-resolving detectors (ERDs) are a promising technology for this purpose as, despite their technological challenges, needing to be cooled below their superconducting transition temperature ($&lt; 1\mathrm{K}$), they have essentially zero read noise, dark current, or clock-induced charge, and can get the wavelength of each incident photon without the use of additional throughput-reducing filters or gratings that spread light over many pixels. The use of these detectors on HWO will not only impact the science of the mission by decreasing the required exposure times for exo-Earth detection and characterization, but also in a wavefront sensing and control context when used for starlight suppression to generate a dark zone. We show simulated results using both an EMCCD and an ERD to ``dig a dark zone'' demonstrating that ERDs can achieve the same final contrast as an EMCCD in about half of the total time. We also perform a simple case study using an exposure time calculator tool called the Error Budget Software (EBS) to determine the required integration times to detect water for HWO targets of interest using both EMCCDs and ERDs. This shows that once a dark zone is achieved, using an ERD can decrease these exposure times by factors of 1.5--2 depending on the specific host star properties.</description>

      <title>A Census of the beta Pic Moving Group and Other Nearby Associations with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I have used the third data release of the Gaia mission to improve the reliability and completeness of membership samples in the beta Pic moving group (BPMG) and other nearby associations with ages of 20-50 Myr (Sco Body, Carina, Columba, chi1 For, Tuc-Hor, IC 2602, IC 2391, NGC 2547). I find that Carina, Columba, and chi1 For are physically related and coeval, and that Carina is the closest fringe of a much larger association. Similarly, Tuc-Hor and IC 2602 form a coeval population that is spatially and kinematically continuous. Both results agree with hypotheses from Gagne et al. (2021). I have used the new catalogs to study the associations in terms of their initial mass functions, X-ray emission, ages, and circumstellar disks. For instance, using the model for Li depletion from Jeffries et al. (2023), I have derived an age of 24.7+0.9/-0.6 Myr for BPMG, which is similar to estimates from previous studies. In addition, I have used infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to check for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the members of the associations, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of known disks around M stars at ages of 30-50 Myr and a significant improvement in measurements of excess fractions for those spectral types and ages. Most notably, I find that the W3 excess fraction for M0-M6 initially declines with age to a minimum in BPMG &lt;0.015), increases to a maximum in Carina/Columba chi1 For (0.041+0.009/-0.007, 34 Myr), and declines again in the oldest two associations (40-50 Myr). The origin of that peak and the nature of the M dwarf disks at &gt;20 Myr are unclear.</description>

      <title>Stability and fate of hierarchical triples comprising a central massive body and a tight binary in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the stability and fate of gravitational triple systems comprising a central massive body and a tight binary of less massive pairs. Our present purpose is two fold; (1) to improve the Hill-type stability criterion for the binary in those systems, and (2) to examine the fate of the triple systems after the binary break-up, with particular attention to the effects of the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. We perform direct Newtonian N-body simulations over much longer integration times than previous studies, which is essential to determine the eventual fate of those systems statistically in a reliable fashion. We obtain an empirical fitting formula of the binary stability boundary that incorporates effects of the inner and outer eccentricities, the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits, and the mass ratios of the three bodies. We also find that those triple systems are stable for a much longer timescale after the binary break-up, and that their final fates (ejection of the outer body, merger to the central massive body, and collision of two less massive bodies) are very sensitive to the initial outer eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Contour Analysis Tool: an interactive tool for background and morphology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Contour Analysis Tool (CAT), a Python toolkit aimed at identifying and analyzing structural elements in density maps. CAT employs various contouring techniques, including the lowest-closed contour (LCC), linear and logarithmic Otsu thresholding, and average gradient thresholding. These contours can aid in foreground and background segmentation, providing natural limits for both, as well as edge detection and structure identification. Additionally, CAT provides image processing methods such as smoothing, background removal, and image masking. The toolkit features an interactive suite of controls designed for Jupyter environments, enabling users to promptly visualize the effects of different methods and parameters. We describe, test, and demonstrate the performance of CAT, highlighting its potential use cases. CAT is publicly available on GitHub, promoting accessibility and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Searching for Stellar Activity Cycles using Flares: The Short and Long Timescale Activity Variations of TIC-272272592</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06631v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine 4 years of Kepler 30-min data, and 5 Sectors of TESS 2-min data for the dM3 star KIC-8507979/TIC-272272592. This rapidly rotating (P=1.2 day) star has previously been identified as flare active, with a possible long-term decline in its flare output. Such slow changes in surface magnetic activity are potential indicators of Solar-like activity cycles, which can yield important information about the structure of the stellar dynamo. We find that while TIC-272272592 shows evidence for both short and long timescale variations in its flare activity, it is unlikely physically motivated. Only a handful of stars have been subjected to such long baseline point-in-time flare studies, and we urge caution in comparing results between telescopes due to differences in bandpass, signal to noise, and cadence. In this work, we develop an approach to measure variations in the flare frequency distributions over time, which is quantified as a function of the observing baseline. For TIC-272272592, we find a $2.7\sigma$ detection of a Sector which has a flare deficit, therefore indicating the short term variation could be a result of sampling statistics. This quantifiable approach to describing flare rate variation is a powerful new method for measuring the months-to-years changes in surface magnetic activity, and provides important constraints on activity cycles and dynamo models for low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in a sample of planet-hosting M dwarf stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic fields have a major impact on space weather around exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars. From an analysis of Zeeman-broadened Fe I lines measured in near-infrared SDSS/APOGEE spectra, mean magnetic fields are determined for a sample of 29 M dwarf stars that host closely orbiting small exoplanets. The calculations employed the radiative transfer code Synmast and MARCS stellar model atmospheres. The sample M dwarfs are found to have measurable mean magnetic fields ranging between $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$1.5 kG, falling in the unsaturated regime on the $&lt;$B$&gt;$ vs P$_{\rm rot}$ plane. The sample systems contain 43 exoplanets, which include 23 from Kepler, nine from K2, and nine from TESS. We evaluated their equilibrium temperatures, insolation, and stellar habitable zones and found that only Kepler-186f and TOI-700d are inside the habitable zones of their stars. Using the derived values of $&lt;$B$&gt;$ for the stars Kepler-186 and TOI-700 we evaluated the minimum planetary magnetic field that would be necessary to shield the exoplanets Kepler-186f and TOI-700d from their host star's winds, considering reference magnetospheres with sizes equal to those of the present-day and young Earth, respectively. Assuming a ratio of 5$\%$ between large-to-small scale B-fields, and a young-Earth magnetosphere, Kepler-186f and TOI-700d would need minimum planetary magnetic fields of, respectively, 0.05 and 0.24 G. These values are considerably smaller than Earth's magnetic field of 0.25 G$\lesssim$B$\lesssim$0.65 G, which suggests that these two exoplanets might have magnetic fields sufficiently strong to protect their atmospheres and surfaces from stellar magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The K2-24 planetary system revisited by CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical (RV+TTV) re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.</description>
