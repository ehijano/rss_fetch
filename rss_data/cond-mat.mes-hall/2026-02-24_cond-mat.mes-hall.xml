      <title>Transport in close-packed solids with stacking defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium are the only solids that are known to lose crystalline order upon cooling. The seemingly-disordered low-temperature phase shows signatures of various close-packed structures. The lack of order has been attributed to a hidden gauge symmetry that arises when electrons from one layer can hop to a neighbouring layer but not further. It makes all close-packed structures nearly degenerate and leads to ``structural frustration''. In this article, we examine whether this symmetry is reflected in transport signatures. Taking advantage of in-plane translational periodicity, we map the bulk Bloch Hamiltonian to an effective one-dimensional chain, with stacking disorder mapping to random phases of the hopping amplitudes. We derive an explicit analytic form for the Green's function of electrons and use it to calculate conductance of a bulk crystal. When hopping in the effective one-dimensional chain is restricted to nearest neighbours, conductance is completely insensitive to phase disorder, which indicates that all close-packed structures exhibit the same conductance. We show that the leading correction that can differentiate between close-packed structures arises from hopping to the next-nearest-neighbour layer, equivalent to second-neighbour hopping in the chain model. This process appears when a pair of next-neighbour layers are aligned in a certain way, e.g., at an hcp-like stacking fault within an fcc background. With this hopping included, conductance becomes sensitive to the precise arrangement of layers. When multiple stacking faults are present, the conductance decreases with increasing system size, as expected from Anderson localization. Our results are applicable to pressurized lithium and sodium, where conductance measurements can identify and characterize stacking faults.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Anyons attached to Superconducting Islands in FQH Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea that topologically protected quantum states, such as anyons, may be attached to super/semiconductor heterostructures has received enormous attention, but experimental signatures in 1D systems remain elusive. Here we revisit theoretical underpinnings of anyons in 2D fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, whose signatures have been experimentally observed by independent groups. Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the atomistic Hubbard U interaction from moir\'e system STM-images using image recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomistic Hubbard interaction U, representing the on-site Coulomb repulsion, serves as a pivotal parameter in theoretical models describing of correlated systems, yet its precise experimental determination especially in moir\'e systems remains challenging. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy(STM) provides real-space images of the local density of states (LDOS), offering rich data sets that reflect the unique electronic structure of the material. Here, we introduce a systematic methodology for extracting the Hubbard U parameter directly from these LDOS images through the application of machine learning (ML) in the case of twisted bilayer graphene in the flat-band regime. The regression of U is highly accurate even though the image-similarity is greater than 99.98%. Subsequent data-analysis further suggest a weak crossover between the weak and strong coupling regime at Uc/t 1</description>

      <title>Atomistic substrate relaxation effects in the band gaps of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of atomistic substrate lattice relaxation schemes in the primary band gap at charge neutrality and the secondary valence band gap of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (G/h-BN) as a function of twist angle. For zero twist angle, the primary gap decreases from $\sim 30$~meV in fully relaxed suspended G/h-BN bilayers, to $\sim 9$~meV when the remote h-BN substrate layer is kept rigid, and down to $\sim 3$~meV in completely rigid structures. In the presence of relaxations, the primary gap shows a maximum near $\sim 0.6^{\circ}$ coinciding with energetic stabilization due to alignment between the moir\'e pattern and the graphene lattice vectors, while the secondary valence band gap drops from $\sim 12$~meV down to zero beyond twist angles of $\sim 1^{\circ}$. A small but finite primary gap on the order of $\sim 1$~meV, with a mass sign favoring electronic occupation of carbon atop boron, persists across twist angles from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}$ for all sliding configurations, and switches sign for twist angles between $30^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Exact expression for the Berry connection in the projection gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry connection encodes the momentum-space geometry of occupied Bloch states in gapped insulators and plays a central role in topological materials. While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin-Seebeck diode in $f$-wave magnets, third-order spin-Nernst effects in $g$-wave magnets and spin-Nernst effects in $i$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent feature of $d$-wave altermagnets is that spin current is generated by applying temperature gradient, which is known as the spin-Nernst effect. We show in $f$-wave magnets that spin current is generated proportional to the square of the temperature gradient, which we call the nonlinear spin-Seebeck current. It can be used as a spin current diode. In addition, we show in $g$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated in the third order of the temperature gradient. We also show in $i$-wave altermagnets that spin current is generated perpendicular to the temperature gradient, which is the spin-Nernst current. We have derived analytic formulas for these spin currents. It is interesting that these phenomena occur in the absence of the spin-orbit interaction. On the other hand, we show in $p$-wave magnets that spin current is not generated by temperature gradient.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum and Classical Descriptions of Spin Dynamics in a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya Trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin dynamics of a trimer with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction are investigated within a unified Hamiltonian framework that connects quantum-mechanical and semiclassical descriptions. The interpolation between the two regimes is realised by solving the modified Gisin-Schr\"odinger equation, in which the relative weight of a quantum coherence and local mean-field contributions is continuously tuned. The resulting dynamical behaviour is analysed and summarised in a ground state diagram that illustrates how the character of the spin motion evolves from fully quantum to semiclassical as the DM interaction is treated at different levels of approximation. In the last part of the publication, the chiral spin dynamics proposed by Da-Wei Wang et al. is examined theoretically, taking into account its behaviour at the boundary between quantum and classical physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Pinning for Skyrmions in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics, Hall angle, and pinning for N{\'e}el skyrmions in an altermagnet. Using an atomistic model, we show that skyrmion velocity and Hall angle dependence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the drive, due to the fourfold symmetry implied by the two sublattices of the altermagnet. The skyrmion Hall angle and velocity at fixed drive show strong variations for increasing ratios of the exchange constant of the sublattices, $J_2/J_1$. This fourfold anisotropy of altermagnetic (ATM) skyrmions also leads to anisotropic pinning effects for an ATM skyrmion interacting with isotropic circular pinning sites. We also propose a simple particle model for this system that takes into account this anisotropy and find that it captures both the variations of the ATM skyrmion Hall angle and velocity as a function of drive direction, as also found in the atomistic simulations. Using this particle model, we examine ATM skyrmions interacting with a periodic array of pinning sites. For increasing ratios of $J_2/J_1$, we find a strongly non-monotonic ATM skyrmion velocity, where there is a minimum in the velocity where the skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the periodic pinning lattice. For a random array, we find that ATM skyrmions show strongly anisotropic depinning thresholds and velocity responses for different drive directions, and that the Hall angle is nearly constant with drive. In comparison, for the same parameters, the depinning threshold for a ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion is lower, and the skyrmion Hall angle shows a strong velocity dependence. The lower depinning threshold for FM skyrmions is due to stronger Magnus forces.</description>

      <title>Temporal magnon-qubit Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal magnon-qubit Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer is proposed. The interferometer is based on controllable entanglement of a microwave qubit and a magnonic state, achieved by application of a pulsed magnetic field playing the role of a magnon-qubit temporal "beam splitter". Analogous to a typical MZ interferometer, the generated interference pattern of the final qubit population carries information about the magnon dynamics. One important application of the proposed scheme is the study of single magnon decoherence. Interestingly, this scheme allows one to independently determine rates of two possible decoherence channels. This may help enable single magnon state applications and answer fundamental questions of quasi-particle decoherence at single quantum levels.</description>

      <title>Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling Induced Topological Phases Transition in Honeycomb Nanoribbon Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of non-trivial topological phases arising from the interplay between structural geometry and the spin degree of freedom. Our system is a honeycomb nanoribbon heterostructure with armchair edges, consisting of a central Rashba spin-orbit coupled (SOC) region sandwiched between two pristine armchair nanoribbons. As the strength of Rashba SOC is increased, topological edge states exhibit at the interface between the Rashba SOC and pristine armchair honeycomb nanoribbon (ANR), and these edge states remain robust under edge perturbations. In addition, we find that for a finite width ANR, Rashba SOC can open/close a gap depending on its strength, which leads to a topological phase transition. This work provides an alternative perspective on how Rashba SOC influences topological properties.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots synthesized by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (pQDs) are promising quantum light emitters, and investigations at the single pQD scale have so far relied mostly on hot-injection synthesis, which requires precise temperature control and an inert atmosphere. While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Theory of Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lasers serve as the fundamental workhorses of photonic quantum technologies, with perfectly coherent light fields being essential for many protocols that generate nonclassical light, implement coherent control schemes, and initialize qubits. However, no laser is absolutely ideal and the implications of deviations from perfect coherence in quantum technological tasks remain unclear. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Transcendental momentum quantization in semiconducting Rashba nanowires and zero energy states in their normal and superconducting phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite system properties of the canonical low energy model for a semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The case of an isolated wire as well as of one proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are considered. Already for the normal wire, the presence of spin-orbit coupling leads to eigenstates of the finite system composed of more than two momentum eigenstates. The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates. In this case we derive an approximate quantization condition close to the phase boundary, and a condition for the appearance of exact zero energy states. It can be satisfied both in the topological and in the trivial phase. Both the trivial and topological zero energy states contribute to the linear transport through Andreev reflection and direct transmission processes, with their relative importance depending on the degree of the states' localization at the boundary.</description>

Abstract: The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), which describes the rotation and ellipticity of linearly polarized light upon reflection, typically occurs in magnetic materials that break time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a similar effect can emerge even in two-dimensional nonmagnetic systems with $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, owing to the nontrivial quantum geometry of electrons. We reveal that the nematicity of the quantum metric, which corresponds to electric quadrupole moment of electron wave packets, gives rise to a Kerr-like effect (KLE) depending on the incident polarization angle. Notably, neither magnetic order nor spin-orbit coupling, which are conventionally considered essential for the MOKE, is required for its emergence. The KLE is demonstrated by using both a minimal tight-binding model and a model for strained MoS$_2$ with parameters determined by first-principle calculations. This work reveals a quantum-geometric origin for polarization rotation effects beyond the MOKE and offers a distinct approach to probe quantum geometry and multipole moments of electrons.</description>

      <title>The interplay of cation/anion and monovalent/divalent selectivity in negatively charged nanopores: local charge inversion and anion leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is widely regarded as a hallmark of calcium versus monovalent ion selectivity in negatively charged pores. While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\ anion selecivity.</description>

      <title>Towards the optimization of a perovskite-based room temperature ozone sensor: A multifaceted approach in pursuit of sensitivity, stability, and understanding of mechanism</title>

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted significant attention owing to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, vital for sensor performance, are still unexclusive. This work presents the first evaluation of the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs, considering factors such as halide composition variation and Mn doping levels. The research reveals a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior, with Br-rich sensors displaying a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibit an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhances the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process, as supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation of the sensors provides valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors, highlighting the impact of dynamic instabilities over time. Overall, this research offers insights into optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels, representing a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable, marking a new era in sensor technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the monolithic, two-step epitaxial growth of site-controlled InGaAs quantum dots via the buried stressor method with local quantum dot density variation. As a result of high fabrication accuracy, we achieve low lateral displacements of the individual buried stressor apertures of $ 17^{+19}_{-17}$~nm from mesa centers. We provide extensive micro-photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence characterization of the site-controlled quantum dots and give theoretical calculations, explaining the effect of the stressor aperture on the quantum dot emission properties, positioning, and density. We show reproducibility of the nucleation process for apertures of the same size and achieve precisely-positioned, low- and high-density quantum dot nucleation within one active layer growth step. The results presented in this work demonstrate the significant potential of the buried stressor concept in fabricating single photonic chips, simultaneously combining single-photon sources and microlasers featuring different local densities of site-controlled quantum dots, paving the way for highly functional source modules with applications in photonic quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Atomic Layer Deposition Pulse Time through Physics-Informed Bayesian Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process development is often hindered by time-consuming and precursor-intensive tuning cycles required to identify saturation conditions. We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\geq$95\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors.</description>

      <title>Giant Out-of-Plane Magnetic Orbital Torque of Altermagnets from Spin-Group Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To search for nontrivial spintronic characters of altermagnets has been a focus in spintronics, with numerous attentions paid to spin-group symmetry dictated non-relativistic effects, such as the spin-splitting torque (SST). Here, we go beyond this paradigm by unveiling the magnetic orbital torque (MOT) that is enabled only by spin-group symmetry breaking of real altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling. This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST. Our first-principles calculations predict giant out-of-plane MOTs at room temperature in the absence of and competing with SST in experimentally identified altermagnets CrSb and FeSb2, respectively. These findings uncover new fundamental physics in altermagnetic spintronics, and open up broad vistas of altermagnets in magnetic memory.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -- Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) Hybrid System Using Domain-Wall Synapse Devices and Nano-Constriction Spin Hall Nano Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coupled spintronic oscillator array has been considered attractive for neuromorphic computing applications. Experimental reports have shown the nano-constriction geometry to be a relatively easier-to-fabricate platform for implementing such spin oscillators, but most prior reports on training and inference algorithms for neuromorphic computing using spin oscillators have been mostly restricted to the nano-pillar geometry. Also, those prior reports involve updating the natural frequency values of the oscillators and moving the synchronization regions on to the data clusters during the offline learning phase, which has associated challenges. In this context, we design and simulate a novel artificial neural network (ANN) - oscillator neural network (ONN) algorithm where in the offline learning phase, the weight parameters of the ANN are updated such that the data clusters are instead moved to the synchronization regions of spin Hall nano oscillators (SHNOs) in the nano-constriction geometry, as obtained through micromagnetic simulations. We further simulate the on-chip inference part of the ANN-ONN algorithm where the ANN is implemented on a crossbar array of domain-wall synapse devices, as simulated here through micromagnetics, and the ONN is implemented on nano-constriction SHNOs. We show successful data classification for both binary and multi-class classification tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Bridging atomic and mesoscopic length scales with Replica Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Visualizing the intra-unit cell pair density modulation of superconducting FeSe at micron length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a cornerstone technique for visualizing the electronic density of states with atomic resolution (typically below 0.1 nm). While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position.</description>

      <title>Twist-induced altermagnetism in a metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism -a magnetic state characterized by spin-polarized electronic bands at zero net magnetization- offers a promising route for next-generation spintronic devices. In two-dimensional (2D) magnets, twist engineering enables its realization by breaking the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry (PT) while preserving crystal symmetries that ensure the altermagnetic order. Here, by means of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twist engineering applied to the recently synthesized metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet Co-doped bilayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ (Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$) provides a robust platform for altermagnetism. By twisting two layers of Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$, the PT symmetry between opposite spin sublattices is broken, resulting in a non-relativistic $i$-wave altermagnetic state with spin splitting up to 138 meV. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the electronic states are spin-degenerate along six high-symmetry directions, while the inclusion of SOC preserves this degeneracy along the three directions protected by twofold rotation axes. Furthermore, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the magnetic behavior in twisted Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$. Our results establish twist engineering and metallic Fe-based van der Waals antiferromagnets as versatile platforms to realize 2D van der Waals altermagnetism, with potential for designing high-efficiency ultrathin nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Heat flow through the quantum heat valve coupled to ohmic baths via a master equation approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical model for the non-equilibrium steady state heat flow through a quantum heat valve. The model is based on a master equation approach, where the partial secular approximation has been carefully performed in order to obtain accurate results. Our study assumes an ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths of the model. This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue. Our findings confirm that the careful application of the master equation approach, in particular when it comes to the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors offer an excellent platform for the study of vortex matter due to their low superfluid stiffness and inability to effectively screen applied magnetic fields. Here we explore vortices in a two-dimensional superconductor formed at the surface of the complex oxide KTaO$_3$. Multiple regimes of vortex-mediated transport are identified and studied, revealing switching behaviour attributed to nucleation of individual vortices. Analysis of this regime allows us to identify the quantum tunneling of vortices, which transitions to thermally activated behaviour at elevated temperatures. Magnetic field dependence reveals rich histograms of the switching currents which we attribute to different configurations of pinned vortices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hall effect in topologically trivial isolated flat-band systems (i.e., flat bands are separated from other bands and have zero Chern number) for a weak magnetic field. In a naive semiclassical picture, the Hall conductivity vanishes when dispersive bands are unoccupied, since there are no mobile carriers. To go beyond the semiclassical picture, we establish a fully quantum mechanical gauge-invariant formula for the Hall conductivity that can be applied to any lattice models. We apply the formula to a general $N+M$-band model with $N$ dispersive bands and $M$-fold degenerate isolated flat bands, and find that when the dispersive bands are unoccupied, the total conductivity takes a universal form consisting of the energy difference between the dispersive and flat bands, and the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor of the flat bands, which can be nonzero in systems with vanishing Berry curvature. We numerically confirm the Hall effect for isolated flat-band lattice models on the honeycomb lattice ($N=M=1$) and two different Kagome lattices ($N=2$, $M=1$ and $N=1$, $M=2$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the N\'eel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the N\'eel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moir\'e superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moir\'e systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift retains its conventional form, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. We find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet--Kulik quartet levels is equal to the inverse of the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory. Our model is specifically inspired by the recent Harvard and Penn State group experiments.</description>

      <title>Roles of Electron-Magnon Cross-Diffusion in Unidirectional Magnetoresistance of Metallic Magnetic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Dual-Spaces Invariance as a Universal Criterion for Identifying Multifractal Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Anderson localization physics, eigenstates of disordered quantum systems are commonly classified as extended, localized, or critical, distinguished by their distinct spatial structures in real space. While critical states are known to exhibit multifractal characteristics, a precise and operational criterion for characterizing critical states remains an open challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by revisiting criticality from a dual-spaces perspective that treats position and momentum representations on equal footing. Building on the Liu--Xia criterion, which characterizes critical states by the simultaneous vanishing of Lyapunov exponents ($\gamma=\gamma_m=0$) in both spaces, we show that this dual-spaces characterization captures an essential feature of critical states that is not limited to Lyapunov exponents. In particular, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inverse participation ratio exhibits closely related scaling behavior in position and momentum space for critical states. This position-momentum correspondence clearly distinguishes critical states from extended or localized ones, which instead display a pronounced asymmetry between the two representations. Our results establish a robust and universal framework for precisely characterizing multifractal critical states in disordered quantum systems, and provide practical guidance for their identification in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrate interaction. In this study, it is shown that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3{\deg}) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First-principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate properties, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of halogenated carbon atomic wires (halopolyynes) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid and their comprehensive Raman characterization. Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that halogen terminations act as auxochromes through p-$\pi$ conjugation between their lone-pair electrons and the sp-carbon backbone, extending effective conjugation length. This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found signatures of surface superconductivity consisting of gap openings compatible with a critical temperature orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence. Here we use very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and find robust superconductivity with T$_C=$2.9 K and H$_{C2}\approx$1.8 T linked to the Fermi arcs. We observe quantized superconducting vortices, demonstrating two-dimensional macroscopic quantum phase coherence.</description>

      <title>Single-gate, multipartite entanglement on a room-temperature quantum register</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates and close to the fundamental limit set by the hyperfine coupling frequencies. Parallel three-qubit gates are also realized with all nuclear-qubit subsets. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. The four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <title>Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.</description>
