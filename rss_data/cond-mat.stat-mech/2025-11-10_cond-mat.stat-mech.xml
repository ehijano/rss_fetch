      <title>Recursive entropy in thermodynamics: establishing the statistical-physics basis of the zentropy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recursive property of entropy is well known in the field of information theory; however, the concept is rarely used in the field of thermodynamics, despite being the field where the concept of entropy originated. This work shows that the equation for entropy used in the zentropy, which is an exact multiscale approach to thermodynamics, is a statement of the recursive property of entropy. Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational contributions from intra-configurational ones. Building on this, we derive the partition function, as used in zentropy, by maximizing entropy in its recursive form. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Application of boundary functionals of the theory of random processes to aerosol coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to describing aerosol behavior is proposed. Boundary functionals of random process theory are applied to describe the behavior of aerosol concentrations during coagulation. It is shown that considering the first-passage time of a given aerosol concentration level corresponds to experimental results for the time dependence of aerosol concentration. Probabilities for aerosol concentrations to attain specific values are obtained, as well as expressions for average aerosol concentrations.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.</description>

      <title>Exact strong zero modes in quantum circuits and spin chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>

      <title>Bounds on quantum Fisher information and uncertainty relations for thermodynamically conjugate variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations represent a foundational principle in quantum mechanics, imposing inherent limits on the precision with which \textit{mechanically} conjugate variables such as position and momentum can be simultaneously determined. This work establishes analogous relations for \textit{thermodynamically} conjugate variables -- specifically, a classical intensive parameter $\theta$ and its corresponding extensive quantum operator $\hat{O}$ -- in equilibrium states. We develop a framework to derive a rigorous thermodynamic uncertainty relation for such pairs, where the uncertainty of the classical parameter $\theta$ is quantified by its quantum Fisher information $\mathcal{F}_\theta$. The framework is based on an exact integral representation that relates $\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$ to the autocorrelation function of operator $\hat{O}$. From this representation, we derive a tight upper bound for the quantum Fisher information, which yields a thermodynamic uncertainty relation: $\Delta\theta\,\overline{\Delta O} \ge k_\text{B}T$ with $\overline{\Delta O}\equiv\partial_\theta\langle\hat{O}\rangle\,\Delta\theta$ and $T$ is the system temperature. The result establishes a fundamental precision limit for quantum sensing and metrology in thermal systems, directly connecting it to the thermodynamic properties of linear response and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for perturbation theory at any order with infinitely many perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic formula, in terms of integer partitions, that generates perturbation theory explicitly at an arbitrary order. Our approach naturally includes an infinite number of perturbations and uses a single matrix equation that contains the information for both the eigenvalue and eigenvector corrections. The formula reduces to the standard case of one perturbation in the appropriate limit. This formulation streamlines the derivations that are traditionally tedious in perturbation theory, facilitating high-order calculations.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for quantum metric, Berry curvature, and quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix, indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$ density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:1606.08693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or dynamics generating trajectories over time. Similar in principle, these studies can be executed in tracking how a given function of observable properties evolve over time akin to a system's particle motion, so-called {\it functional-diffusion}. This is not the same as systems' own trajectories but can be considered as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how an approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the functional's diffusive behavior depending on a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. System's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-laws on the approach to ergodicity provide the classification of anomalies in the {\it functional-diffusion}, demonstrating non-linear anomalous behavior over different temperature and field ranges.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we numerically show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. This claim is further supported by analytical effective-medium theory and by numerical estimates of scattering mean-free paths. Finally, we introduce ``polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonequilibrium distribution of large ions in charged small nanopores</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to a remarkable discovery [2-4]: with a locally nonchaotic energy barrier, a macroscopic system may produce useful work in a cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic nonequilibrium steady state associated with local nonchaoticity. In the current investigation, we experimentally validate this concept, with the weak gravitational force in the "toy model" being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on a set of nanoporous carbon electrodes immersed in aqueous cesium pivalate solutions. The key characteristic is that the effective nanopore size is only slightly larger than the effective ion size, less than twice the ion size. At first glance, the supercapacitive cells exhibit "normal" charge curves. However, the steady-state distribution of the large ions in the charged small nanopores inherently differs from thermodynamic equilibrium, because of the confinement effect of the nanopore walls. The measured potential difference is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit calculated from the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Although counterintuitive, such a phenomenon is consistent with the molecular dynamics simulations in open literature.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>

Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from the self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves and construct the corresponding phase diagram, which is also applicable to general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition and suppression of critical phase of thermofield double state in monitored quantum circuit with unitary $R$ matrix gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00396</link>

Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model and is post-selection free when an overcrossing and an undercrossing coincide. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by SWAP gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect originating from worldline braiding dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady states in multi-bath quantum collision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>
