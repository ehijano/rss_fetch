      <title>TherAIssist: Assisting Art Therapy Homework and Client-Practitioner Collaboration through Human-AI Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Art therapy homework is essential for fostering clients' reflection on daily experiences between sessions. However, current practices present challenges: clients often lack guidance for completing tasks that combine art-making and verbal expression, while therapists find it difficult to track and tailor homework.How HCI systems might support art therapy homework remains underexplored. To address this, we present TherAIssist, comprising a client-facing application leveraging human-AI co-creative art-making and conversational agents to facilitate homework, and a therapist-facing application enabling customization of homework agents and AI-compiled homework history. A 30-day field study with 24 clients and 5 therapists showed how TherAIssist supported clients' homework and reflection in their everyday settings. Results also revealed how therapists infused their practice principles and personal touch into the agents to offer tailored homework, and how AI-compiled homework history became a meaningful resource for in-session interactions. Implications for designing human-AI systems to facilitate asynchronous client-practitioner collaboration are discussed.</description>

      <title>Simulating Cooperative Prosocial Behavior with Multi-Agent LLMs: Evidence and Mechanisms for AI Agents to Inform Policy Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human prosocial cooperation is essential for our collective health, education, and welfare. However, designing social systems to maintain or incentivize prosocial behavior is challenging because people can act selfishly to maximize personal gain. This complex and unpredictable aspect of human behavior makes it difficult for policymakers to foresee the implications of their designs. Recently, multi-agent LLM systems have shown remarkable capabilities in simulating human-like behavior, and replicating some human lab experiments. This paper studies how well multi-agent systems can simulate prosocial human behavior, such as that seen in the public goods game (PGG), and whether multi-agent systems can exhibit ``unbounded actions'' seen outside the lab in real world scenarios. We find that multi-agent LLM systems successfully replicate human behavior from lab experiments of the public goods game with three experimental treatments - priming, transparency, and varying endowments. Beyond replicating existing experiments, we find that multi-agent LLM systems can replicate the expected human behavior when combining experimental treatments, even if no previous study combined those specific treatments. Lastly, we find that multi-agent systems can exhibit a rich set of unbounded actions that people do in the real world outside of the lab -- such as collaborating and even cheating. In sum, these studies are steps towards a future where LLMs can be used to inform policy decisions that encourage people to act in a prosocial manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartoon videos have proven to be effective in learning vocabulary to preschool children.However, we have little knowledge about integrating AI into cartoon videos to provide systematic, multimodal vocabulary learning support. This late-breaking work present \name{}, an AI-powered cartoon video system that enables real-time Q\&amp;A, vocabulary review, and contextual learning. Preliminary findings contextualized how families interact with \name{} to support vocabulary learning. Parents appreciated the system for its personalized, engaging experiences, fostering collaboration, and encouraging self-reflection on parenting. This study offers valuable design implications for informing future video systems to support vocabulary learning.</description>

      <title>UXAgent: An LLM Agent-Based Usability Testing Framework for Web Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usability testing is a fundamental yet challenging (e.g., inflexible to iterate the study design flaws and hard to recruit study participants) research method for user experience (UX) researchers to evaluate a web design. Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM-Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human subject study. Our system features an LLM-Agent module and a universal browser connector module so that UX researchers can automatically generate thousands of simulated users to test the target website. The results are shown in qualitative (e.g., interviewing how an agent thinks ), quantitative (e.g., # of actions), and video recording formats for UX researchers to analyze. Through a heuristic user evaluation with five UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent-assisted UX study.</description>

      <title>Introducing ROADS: A Systematic Comparison of Remote Control Interaction Concepts for Automated Vehicles at Road Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As vehicle automation technology continues to mature, there is a necessity for robust remote monitoring and intervention features. These are essential for intervening during vehicle malfunctions, challenging road conditions, or in areas that are difficult to navigate. This evolution in the role of the human operator - from a constant driver to an intermittent teleoperator - necessitates the development of suitable interaction interfaces. While some interfaces were suggested, a comparative study is missing. We designed, implemented, and evaluated three interaction concepts (path planning, trajectory guidance, and waypoint guidance) with up to four concurrent requests of automated vehicles in a within-subjects study with N=23 participants. The results showed a clear preference for the path planning concept. It also led to the highest usability but lower satisfaction. With trajectory guidance, the fewest requests were resolved. The study's findings contribute to the ongoing development of HMIs focused on the remote assistance of automated vehicles.</description>

      <title>ExoKit: A Toolkit for Rapid Prototyping of Interactions for Arm-based Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeletons open up a unique interaction space that seamlessly integrates users' body movements with robotic actuation. Despite its potential, human-exoskeleton interaction remains an underexplored area in HCI, largely due to the lack of accessible prototyping tools that enable designers to easily develop exoskeleton designs and customized interactive behaviors. We present ExoKit, a do-it-yourself toolkit for rapid prototyping of low-fidelity, functional exoskeletons targeted at novice roboticists. ExoKit includes modular hardware components for sensing and actuating shoulder and elbow joints, which are easy to fabricate and (re)configure for customized functionality and wearability. To simplify the programming of interactive behaviors, we propose functional abstractions that encapsulate high-level human-exoskeleton interactions. These can be readily accessed either through ExoKit's command-line or graphical user interface, a Processing library, or microcontroller firmware, each targeted at different experience levels. Findings from implemented application cases and two usage studies demonstrate the versatility and accessibility of ExoKit for early-stage interaction design.</description>

      <title>Towards a Design Guideline for RPA Evaluation: A Survey of Large Language Model-Based Role-Playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-Playing Agent (RPA) is an increasingly popular type of LLM Agent that simulates human-like behaviors in a variety of tasks. However, evaluating RPAs is challenging due to diverse task requirements and agent designs. This paper proposes an evidence-based, actionable, and generalizable evaluation design guideline for LLM-based RPA by systematically reviewing 1,676 papers published between Jan. 2021 and Dec. 2024. Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature. Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Human-centered explanation does not fit all: The interplay of sociotechnical, cognitive, and individual factors in the effect AI explanations in algorithmic decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent XAI studies have investigated what constitutes a \textit{good} explanation in AI-assisted decision-making. Despite the widely accepted human-friendly properties of explanations, such as contrastive and selective, existing studies have yielded inconsistent findings. To address these gaps, our study focuses on the cognitive dimensions of explanation evaluation, by evaluating six explanations with different contrastive strategies and information selectivity and scrutinizing factors behind their valuation process. Our analysis results find that contrastive explanations are not the most preferable or understandable in general; Rather, different contrastive and selective explanations were appreciated to a different extent based on who they are, when, how, and what to explain -- with different level of cognitive load and engagement and sociotechnical contexts. Given these findings, we call for a nuanced view of explanation strategies, with implications for designing AI interfaces to accommodate individual and contextual differences in AI-assisted decision-making.</description>

      <title>Could AI Leapfrog the Web? Evidence from Teachers in Sierra Leone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to digital information is a driver of economic development. But although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile broadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the web. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing how 469 teachers use an AI chatbot in Sierra Leone. The chatbot, accessible via a common messaging app, is compared against traditional web search. Teachers use AI more frequently than web search for teaching assistance. Data cost is the most frequently cited reason for low internet usage across Africa. The average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than an AI response, making AI 87% less expensive than web search. Additionally, only 2% of results for corresponding web searches contain content from Sierra Leone. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is significantly reshaping human cognition, influencing how we engage with information, think, reason, and learn. This paper synthesizes existing literature on GenAI's effects on different aspects of human cognition. Drawing on Krathwohl's revised Bloom's Taxonomy and Dewey's conceptualization of reflective thought, we examine the mechanisms through which GenAI is affecting the development of different cognitive abilities. Accordingly, we provide implications for rethinking and designing educational experiences that foster critical thinking and deeper cognitive engagement and discuss future directions to explore the long-term cognitive effects of GenAI.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-Driven Neural Activity Analysis in Parkinsonian Rats under Electrical Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and abnormal neural oscillations. These symptoms can be modulated through electrical stimulation. Traditional neural activity analysis in PD has typically relied on statistical methods, which often introduce bias owing to the need for expert-driven feature extraction. To address this limitation, we explore an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to analyze neural activity in Parkinsonian rats receiving electrical stimulation. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals were collected before and after electrical stimulation using graphene-based electrodes that enable less-invasive monitoring and stimulation in PD. EEGNet, a convolutional neural network, classified these ECoG signals into pre- and post-stimulation states. We applied layer-wise relevance propagation, an XAI technique, to identify key neural inputs contributing to the model's decisions, incorporating the spatial electrode information matched to the cortex map. The XAI analysis highlighted area-specific importance in beta and gamma frequency bands, which could not be detected through mean comparison analyses relying on feature extraction. These findings demonstrate the potential of XAI in analyzing neural dynamics in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, suggesting that the integration of graphene-based electrodes with advanced deep learning models offers a promising solution for real-time PD monitoring and therapy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Machine Translation Corpus Generation: Integrating Human-in-the-Loop Post-Editing with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced methodology for machine translation (MT) corpus generation, integrating semi-automated, human-in-the-loop post-editing with large language models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency and translation quality. Building upon previous work that utilized real-time training of a custom MT quality estimation metric, this system incorporates novel LLM features such as Enhanced Translation Synthesis and Assisted Annotation Analysis, which improve initial translation hypotheses and quality assessments, respectively. Additionally, the system employs LLM-Driven Pseudo Labeling and a Translation Recommendation System to reduce human annotator workload in specific contexts. These improvements not only retain the original benefits of cost reduction and enhanced post-edit quality but also open new avenues for leveraging cutting-edge LLM advancements. The project's source code is available for community use, promoting collaborative developments in the field. The demo video can be accessed here.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Feedback with AI: Comparing the Feedback Quality of LLMs and Teachers on Experimentation Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for fostering students' success in scientific inquiry. With advancements in artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for delivering instant and adaptive feedback. However, this feedback often lacks the pedagogical validation provided by real-world practitioners. To address this limitation, our study evaluates and compares the feedback quality of LLM agents with that of human teachers and science education experts on student-written experimentation protocols. Four blinded raters, all professionals in scientific inquiry and science education, evaluated the feedback texts generated by 1) the LLM agent, 2) the teachers and 3) the science education experts using a five-point Likert scale based on six criteria of effective feedback: Feed Up, Feed Back, Feed Forward, Constructive Tone, Linguistic Clarity, and Technical Terminology. Our results indicate that LLM-generated feedback shows no significant difference to that of teachers and experts in overall quality. However, the LLM agent's performance lags in the Feed Back dimension, which involves identifying and explaining errors within the student's work context. Qualitative analysis highlighted the LLM agent's limitations in contextual understanding and in the clear communication of specific errors. Our findings suggest that combining LLM-generated feedback with human expertise can enhance educational practices by leveraging the efficiency of LLMs and the nuanced understanding of educators.</description>

      <title>HOMIE: Humanoid Loco-Manipulation with Isomorphic Exoskeleton Cockpit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current humanoid teleoperation systems either lack reliable low-level control policies, or struggle to acquire accurate whole-body control commands, making it difficult to teleoperate humanoids for loco-manipulation tasks. To solve these issues, we propose HOMIE, a novel humanoid teleoperation cockpit integrates a humanoid loco-manipulation policy and a low-cost exoskeleton-based hardware system. The policy enables humanoid robots to walk and squat to specific heights while accommodating arbitrary upper-body poses. This is achieved through our novel reinforcement learning-based training framework that incorporates upper-body pose curriculum, height-tracking reward, and symmetry utilization, without relying on any motion priors. Complementing the policy, the hardware system integrates isomorphic exoskeleton arms, a pair of motion-sensing gloves, and a pedal, allowing a single operator to achieve full control of the humanoid robot. Our experiments show our cockpit facilitates more stable, rapid, and precise humanoid loco-manipulation teleoperation, accelerating task completion and eliminating retargeting errors compared to inverse kinematics-based methods. We also validate the effectiveness of the data collected by our cockpit for imitation learning. Our project is fully open-sourced, demos and code can be found in https://homietele.github.io/.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Decision Making with Human Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making. In many cases, despite the algorithm's superior performance, the final decision remains in human hands. For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic tests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies such AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through repeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm -- designed to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines which features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based on their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the algorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff. Should the algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging the human to recognize their importance, even if it results in less accurate predictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to forgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely with their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning? This tradeoff is shaped by the algorithm's time-discounted objective and the human's learning ability. Our results show that optimal feature selection has a surprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary sequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute. As the algorithm becomes more "patient" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm increasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction accuracy and the human's understanding. Notably, early investment in learning leads to the selection of more informative features than a later investment. We complement our analysis by showing that the impact of errors in the algorithm's knowledge is limited as it does not make the prediction directly.</description>

      <title>Magma: A Foundation Model for Multimodal AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Magma, a foundation model that serves multimodal AI agentic tasks in both the digital and physical worlds. Magma is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets. We make our model and code public for reproducibility at https://microsoft.github.io/Magma.</description>

      <title>RHINO: Learning Real-Time Humanoid-Human-Object Interaction from Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots have shown success in locomotion and manipulation. Despite these basic abilities, humanoids are still required to quickly understand human instructions and react based on human interaction signals to become valuable assistants in human daily life. Unfortunately, most existing works only focus on multi-stage interactions, treating each task separately, and neglecting real-time feedback. In this work, we aim to empower humanoid robots with real-time reaction abilities to achieve various tasks, allowing human to interrupt robots at any time, and making robots respond to humans immediately. To support such abilities, we propose a general humanoid-human-object interaction framework, named RHINO, i.e., Real-time Humanoid-human Interaction and Object manipulation. RHINO provides a unified view of reactive motion, instruction-based manipulation, and safety concerns, over multiple human signal modalities, such as languages, images, and motions. RHINO is a hierarchical learning framework, enabling humanoids to learn reaction skills from human-human-object demonstrations and teleoperation data. In particular, it decouples the interaction process into two levels: 1) a high-level planner inferring human intentions from real-time human behaviors; and 2) a low-level controller achieving reactive motion behaviors and object manipulation skills based on the predicted intentions. We evaluate the proposed framework on a real humanoid robot and demonstrate its effectiveness, flexibility, and safety in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>NetPanorama: A Declarative Grammar for Network Construction, Transformation, and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces NetPanorama, a domain-specific language and declarative grammar for interactive network visualization design that supports multivariate, temporal, and geographic networks. NetPanorama allows users to specify network visualizations as combinations of primitives and building blocks. These support network creation and transformation, including computing metrics; orderings, seriations and layouts; visual encodings, including glyphs, faceting, and label visibility; and interaction for exploration and modifying styling. This approach allows the creation of a range of visualizations including many types of node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices using diverse cell encodings and node orderings, arc diagrams, PivotGraph, small multiples, time-arcs, geographic map visualizations, and hybrid techniques such as NodeTrix. NetPanorama aims to remove the need to use multiple libraries for analysis, wrangling, and visualization. Consequently, NetPanorama supports the agile development of applications for visual exploration of networks and data-driven storytelling. Documentation, source code, further examples, and an interactive online editor can be found online: https://netpanorama.netlify.app/.</description>

      <title>A New Framework to Predict and Visualize Technology Acceptance: A Case Study of Shared Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public acceptance is critical to the adoption of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) in the transport sector. Traditional acceptance models, primarily reliant on Structural Equation Modeling, may not adequately capture the complex, non-linear relationships among factors influencing technology acceptance and often have limited predictive capabilities. This paper introduces a framework that combines Machine Learning techniques with chord diagram visualizations to analyze and predict public acceptance of technologies. Using SAV acceptance as a case study, we applied a Random Forest machine learning approach to model the non-linear relationships among psychological factors influencing acceptance. Chord diagrams were then employed to provide an intuitive visualization of the relative importance and interplay of these factors at both factor and item levels in a single plot. Our findings identified Attitude as the primary predictor of SAV usage intention, followed by Perceived Risk, Perceived Usefulness, Trust, and Perceived Ease of Use. The framework also reveals divergent perceptions between SAV adopters and non-adopters, providing insights for tailored strategies to enhance SAV acceptance. This study contributes a data-driven perspective to the technology acceptance discourse, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating predictive modeling with visual analytics to understand the relative importance of factors in predicting public acceptance of emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparing Vibrotactile and Skin-Stretch Haptic Feedback for Conveying Spatial Information of Virtual Objects to Blind VR Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perceiving spatial information of a virtual object (e.g, direction, distance) is critical yet challenging for blind users seeking an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic cues - vibrotactile and skin-stretch cues - in conveying the spatial information of a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We conducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive static and moving objects in VR with a custom-made haptic apparatus. Our results reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's location and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to vibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both types of haptic cues and conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions for VR accessibility.</description>

      <title>Toward a Dialogue System Using a Large Language Model to Recognize User Emotions with a Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of ChatGPT\copyright{} and other LLMs has improved tremendously, and in online environments, they are increasingly likely to be used in a wide variety of situations, such as ChatBot on web pages, call center operations using voice interaction, and dialogue functions using agents. In the offline environment, multimodal dialogue functions are also being realized, such as guidance by Artificial Intelligence agents (AI agents) using tablet terminals and dialogue systems in the form of LLMs mounted on robots. In this multimodal dialogue, mutual emotion recognition between the AI and the user will become important. So far, there have been methods for expressing emotions on the part of the AI agent or for recognizing them using textual or voice information of the user's utterances, but methods for AI agents to recognize emotions from the user's facial expressions have not been studied. In this study, we examined whether or not LLM-based AI agents can interact with users according to their emotional states by capturing the user in dialogue with a camera, recognizing emotions from facial expressions, and adding such emotion information to prompts. The results confirmed that AI agents can have conversations according to the emotional state for emotional states with relatively high scores, such as Happy and Angry.</description>

      <title>Proactive Conversational Agents with Inner Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the long-standing aspirations in conversational AI is to allow them to autonomously take initiatives in conversations, i.e., being proactive. This is especially challenging for multi-party conversations. Prior NLP research focused mainly on predicting the next speaker from contexts like preceding conversations. In this paper, we demonstrate the limitations of such methods and rethink what it means for AI to be proactive in multi-party, human-AI conversations. We propose that just like humans, rather than merely reacting to turn-taking cues, a proactive AI formulates its own inner thoughts during a conversation, and seeks the right moment to contribute. Through a formative study with 24 participants and inspiration from linguistics and cognitive psychology, we introduce the Inner Thoughts framework. Our framework equips AI with a continuous, covert train of thoughts in parallel to the overt communication process, which enables it to proactively engage by modeling its intrinsic motivation to express these thoughts. We instantiated this framework into two real-time systems: an AI playground web app and a chatbot. Through a technical evaluation and user studies with human participants, our framework significantly surpasses existing baselines on aspects like anthropomorphism, coherence, intelligence, and turn-taking appropriateness.</description>

      <title>Interactive Inference: A Neuromorphic Theory of Human-Computer Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic HCI is a new theoretical approach to designing better UX inspired by the neurophysiology of the brain. Here, we apply the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference to HCI, postulating that users perform Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions to predict their next action (Interactive Inference). We show how Bayesian surprise between goal and progress distributions follows a mean square error function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the task. However, capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of SNR, and errors occur when average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error in one framework with real-time estimation of mental load. We show through mathematical theorems how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law fit our model. We then test the validity of the general model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This positive result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can work as a new theoretical underpinning for HCI, deserving further exploration.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Brain-Computer Interface Interaction System Based on the Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Position and Rotation Invariant Sign Language Recognition from 3D Kinect Data with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.12669v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign language is a gesture-based symbolic communication medium among speech and hearing impaired people. It also serves as a communication bridge between non-impaired and impaired populations. Unfortunately, in most situations, a non-impaired person is not well conversant in such symbolic languages restricting the natural information flow between these two categories. Therefore, an automated translation mechanism that seamlessly translates sign language into natural language can be highly advantageous. In this paper, we attempt to perform recognition of 30 basic Indian sign gestures. Gestures are represented as temporal sequences of 3D maps (RGB + depth), each consisting of 3D coordinates of 20 body joints captured by the Kinect sensor. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. To improve the classifier's performance, we use geometric transformation for the alignment correction of depth frames. In our experiments, the model achieves 84.81% accuracy.</description>

      <title>A CNN Based Framework for Unistroke Numeral Recognition in Air-Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air-writing refers to virtually writing linguistic characters through hand gestures in three-dimensional space with six degrees of freedom. This paper proposes a generic video camera-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) based air-writing framework. Gestures are performed using a marker of fixed color in front of a generic video camera, followed by color-based segmentation to identify the marker and track the trajectory of the marker tip. A pre-trained CNN is then used to classify the gesture. The recognition accuracy is further improved using transfer learning with the newly acquired data. The performance of the system varies significantly on the illumination condition due to color-based segmentation. In a less fluctuating illumination condition, the system is able to recognize isolated unistroke numerals of multiple languages. The proposed framework has achieved 97.7%, 95.4% and 93.7% recognition rates in person independent evaluations on English, Bengali and Devanagari numerals, respectively.</description>

      <title>AttributionScanner: A Visual Analytics System for Model Validation with Metadata-Free Slice Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data slice finding is an emerging technique for validating machine learning (ML) models by identifying and analyzing subgroups in a dataset that exhibit poor performance, often characterized by distinct feature sets or descriptive metadata. However, in the context of validating vision models involving unstructured image data, this approach faces significant challenges, including the laborious and costly requirement for additional metadata and the complex task of interpreting the root causes of underperformance. To address these challenges, we introduce AttributionScanner, an innovative human-in-the-loop Visual Analytics (VA) system, designed for metadata-free data slice finding. Our system identifies interpretable data slices that involve common model behaviors and visualizes these patterns through an Attribution Mosaic design. Our interactive interface provides straightforward guidance for users to detect, interpret, and annotate predominant model issues, such as spurious correlations (model biases) and mislabeled data, with minimal effort. Additionally, it employs a cutting-edge model regularization technique to mitigate the detected issues and enhance the model's performance. The efficacy of AttributionScanner is demonstrated through use cases involving two benchmark datasets, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations showcasing its substantial effectiveness in vision model validation, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate models.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass: Transparency Implications and Challenges in Enterprise AI Knowledge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge can't be disentangled from people. As AI knowledge systems mine vast volumes of work-related data, the knowledge that's being extracted and surfaced is intrinsically linked to the people who create and use it. When predictive algorithms that learn from data are used to link knowledge and people, inaccuracies in knowledge extraction and surfacing can lead to disproportionate harms, influencing how individuals see each other and how they see themselves at work. In this paper, we present a reflective analysis of transparency requirements and impacts in this type of systems. We conduct a multidisciplinary literature review to understand the impacts of transparency in workplace settings, introducing the looking-glass metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that reflect and distort, expanding our view on transparency requirements, implications and challenges. We formulate transparency as a key mediator in shaping different ways of seeing, including seeing into the system, which unveils its capabilities, limitations and behavior, and seeing through the system, which shapes workers' perceptions of their own contributions and others within the organization. Recognizing the sociotechnical nature of these systems, we identify three transparency dimensions necessary to realize the value of AI knowledge systems, namely system transparency, procedural transparency and transparency of outcomes. We discuss key challenges hindering the implementation of these forms of transparency, bringing to light the wider sociotechnical gap and highlighting directions for future Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research.</description>

Abstract: Trust plays a pivotal role in Lecturer-Student-Collaboration, encompassing teaching and research aspects. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in platforms like Open AI's ChatGPT, coupled with their cost-effectiveness and high-quality results, has led to their rapid adoption among university students. However, discerning genuine student input from LLM-generated output poses a challenge for lecturers. This dilemma jeopardizes the trust relationship between lecturers and students, potentially impacting university downstream activities, particularly collaborative research initiatives. Despite attempts to establish guidelines for student LLM use, a clear framework mutually beneficial for lecturers and students in higher education remains elusive. This study addresses the research question: How does the use of LLMs by students impact Informational and Procedural Justice, influencing Team Trust and Expected Team Performance? Methodically, we applied a quantitative construct-based survey, evaluated using techniques of Structural Equation Modelling (PLS- SEM) to examine potential relationships among these constructs. Our findings based on 23 valid respondents from Ndejje University indicate that lecturers are less concerned about the fairness of LLM use per se but are more focused on the transparency of student utilization, which significantly influences Team Trust positively. This research contributes to the global discourse on integrating and regulating LLMs and subsequent models in education. We propose that guidelines should support LLM use while enforcing transparency in Lecturer-Student- Collaboration to foster Team Trust and Performance. The study contributes valuable insights for shaping policies enabling ethical and transparent LLMs usage in education to ensure effectiveness of collaborative learning environments.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to explore the reasons behind dissent regarding their existence, antecedents, and effects. It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes.
  The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North.
  Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EUs Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Coordination in Games under Incomplete Information via Multi-Step Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategic coordination between autonomous agents and human partners under incomplete information can be modeled as turn-based cooperative games. We extend a turn-based game under incomplete information, the shared-control game, to allow players to take multiple actions per turn rather than a single action. The extension enables the use of multi-step intent, which we hypothesize will improve performance in long-horizon tasks. To synthesize cooperative policies for the agent in this extended game, we propose an approach featuring a memory module for a running probabilistic belief of the environment dynamics and an online planning algorithm called IntentMCTS. This algorithm strategically selects the next action by leveraging any communicated multi-step intent via reward augmentation while considering the current belief. Agent-to-agent simulations in the Gnomes at Night testbed demonstrate that IntentMCTS requires fewer steps and control switches than baseline methods. A human-agent user study corroborates these findings, showing an 18.52% higher success rate compared to the heuristic baseline and a 5.56% improvement over the single-step prior work. Participants also report lower cognitive load, frustration, and higher satisfaction with the IntentMCTS agent partner.</description>

      <title>WASHtsApp -- A RAG-powered WhatsApp Chatbot for supporting rural African clean water access, sanitation and hygiene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WASHtsApp, a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to educate rural African communities on clean water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) principles. WASHtsApp leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to address the limitations of previous approaches with limited reach or missing contextualization. The paper details the development process, employing Design Science Research Methodology. The evaluation consisted of two phases: content validation by four WASH experts and community validation by potential users. Content validation confirmed WASHtsApp's ability to provide accurate and relevant WASH-related information. Community validation indicated high user acceptance and perceived usefulness of the chatbot. The paper concludes by discussing the potential for further development, including incorporating local languages and user data analysis for targeted interventions. It also proposes future research cycles focused on wider deployment and leveraging user data for educational purposes.</description>

      <title>Code Style Sheets: CSS for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Program text is rendered using impoverished typographic styles. Beyond choice of fonts and syntax-highlighting colors, code editors and related tools utilize very few text decorations. These limited styles are, furthermore, applied in monolithic fashion, regardless of the programs and tasks at hand.
  We present the notion of code style sheets for styling program text. Motivated by analogy to cascading style sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents, code style sheets provide mechanisms for defining rules to select elements from an abstract syntax tree (AST) in order to style their corresponding visual representation. Technically, our selector language generalizes essential notions from CSS to a programming-language setting with algebraic data types (such as ASTs). Practically, code style sheets allow ASTs to be styled granularly, based on semantic information -- such as the structure of abstract syntax, static type information, and corresponding run-time values -- as well as design choices on the part of authors and readers of a program. Because programs are heavily nested in structure, a key aspect of our design is a layout algorithm that renders nested, multiline text blocks more compactly than in existing box-based layout systems such as HTML.
  In this paper, we design and implement a code style sheets system for a subset of Haskell, using it to illustrate several code presentation and visualization tasks. These examples demonstrate that code style sheets provide a uniform framework for rendering programs in multivarious ways, which could be employed in future designs for text-based as well as structure editors.</description>

      <title>Step-Audio: Unified Understanding and Generation in Intelligent Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential. However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio.</description>
