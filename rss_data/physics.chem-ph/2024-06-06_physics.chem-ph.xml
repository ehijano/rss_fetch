      <title>Strong-Coupling Modification of Singlet-Fission Dynamical Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the influence of strong light-matter coupling on the initial steps of the photo-triggered singlet-fission process. In particular we focus on intra-molecular singlet fission in a TIPS-pentacene dimer derivative described by a vibronic Hamiltonian including the optically active singlet excited states, doubly excited and charge transfer states, as well as the final triplet-triplet pair state. Quantum dynamics simulations of up to four dimers in the cavity indicate that the modified resonance condition imposed by the cavity strongly quenches the passage through the intermediate charge transfer and double-excitation states, thus largely reducing the triplet-triplet yield in the bare system. Subsequently, we modify the system parameters and construct a model Hamiltonian where the optically-active singlet excitation lies below the final triplet-triplet state such that the yield of the bare system becomes insignificant. In this case we find that using the upper polariton as the doorway state for photo-excitation can lead to a much enhanced yield. This pathway is operative provided that the system is sufficiently rigid to prevent vibronic losses from the upper polariton to the dark-states manifold.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>

      <title>Fe-MoS$_2$ nanoenzyme with photothermal enhanced enzyme activity for glucose colorimetric detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of nanotechnology, it has been discovered that some nanomaterials have the activity of mimicking enzymes. This type of inorganic nanomaterial with characteristics similar to natural enzymes is called nanoenzyme. Compared with natural enzymes, nanoenzymes have advantages such as low deactivation, good stability, low production and storage costs, surface modification, and large-scale preparation. They have a wide range of applications in fields such as human health, environmental safety, and biosensing. MoS$_2$ can replace natural peroxidase to catalyze the decomposition of H$_2$O$_2$ and is considered to have peroxidase like activity, making it a typical nanoenzyme material. In addition, the Fenton reaction between Fe$_2^+$ and H$_2$O$_2$ can also cause H$_2$O$_2$ to decompose. Both MoS$_2$ and Fe$_2^+$ can cause the decomposition of H$_2$O$_2$, resulting in the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH). Hydroxyl radicals can catalyze the oxidation of chromogenic substrates 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), generating blue single electron oxidation products (oxTMB) and characteristic absorption peaks at 652 nm. Based on this characteristic, we doped Fe$_2^+$ into MoS$_2$ to obtain Fe-MoS$_2$ composite materials. Firstly, natural glucose oxidase is used to decompose glucose into glucose lactone and hydrogen peroxide. Then, Fe-MoS$_2$ composite material is added, and TMB is added dropwise to observe the blue turning of the mixed solution. Based on the above principle, colorimetric detection of glucose can be achieved. In addition, under infrared irradiation, the activity of peroxidase like enzymes in Fe-MoS$_2$ is enhanced.</description>

      <title>Initial electron thermalization in metals measured by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding initial electron thermalization has relevance to both fundamental scientific knowledge and application to the construction of novel devices. In this study, attosecond transient absorption is used to directly measure initial electron thermalization times of 38 $\pm$ 8 fs, 15 $\pm$ 3 fs, 4.2 $\pm$ 1 fs, and 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 fs for Mg, Pt, Fe, and Co, respectively. Through time dependent density function theory calculations, it is shown that the fast electron thermalization observed in Fe and Co is correlated with a strong local field effect. We find that a simple analytical model can be used to calculate the initial electron thermalization time measured by the transient extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy method performed here. Our results suggest that the most significant contributions to the initial electron thermalization times are the basic metal properties of the density of states volume available for scattering and screened electron interaction. Many-body effects contribute less, but still significantly to the initial electron thermalization time. Ultimately the information gained through this study shows the unique view that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy contributes to unraveling and monitoring electron dynamics and its connection to many-body effects in metals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Modulated Ringdown Comb Interferometry for next-generation high complexity trace gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas samples relevant to health and environment typically contain a plethora of molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. High-concentration molecules impose a strong absorption background that hinders robust identification of low-concentration species. While mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has realized many of the most sensitive multi-species trace gas detection to date, its robust performance requires gas samples to contain only weak absorption features to avoid dispersing cavity resonances from the comb line frequencies. Here we introduce a new technique that is free from this restriction, thus enabling the development of next-generation multi-species trace gas sensing with broad applicability to complex and dynamic molecular compositions. The principle of Modulated Ringdown Comb Interferometry is to resolve ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity. This method leverages both periodicity of the field dynamics and Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. Scalable enhancement of both spectral coverage and cavity finesse is enabled with dispersion immune and high-efficiency data collection. Built upon this platform, we realize in the mid-infrared a product of finesse and spectral coverage that is orders of magnitude better than all prior experiments. We demonstrate the power of this technique by measuring highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples over a vastly expanded spectral coverage of 1,010 cm-1 and with cavity finesse of 23,000. This allows for the first time simultaneous quantification of 20 distinct molecular species at &gt; 1 part-per-trillion sensitivity with their concentrations varying by 7 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>PyExoCross: a Python program for generating spectra and cross-sections from molecular line lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PyExoCross is a Python adaptation of the ExoCross Fortran application, PyExoCross is designed for postprocessing the huge molecular line lists generated by the ExoMol project and other similar initiatives such as the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. PyExoCross generates absorption and emission stick spectra, cross-sections, and other properties (partition functions, specific heats, cooling functions, lifetimes, and oscillator strengths) based on molecular line lists. PyExoCross calculates cross-sections with four line profiles: Doppler, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt profiles in both sampling and binned methods; a number of options are available for computing Voigt profiles which we test for speed and accuracy. PyExoCross supports importing and exporting line lists in the ExoMol and HITRAN/HITEMP formats. PyExoCross also provides conversion between the ExoMol and HITRAN data formats. In addition, PyExoCross has extra code for users to automate the batch download of line list files from the ExoMol database.</description>

      <title>Neural canonical transformations for vibrational spectra of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of polyatomic molecules around their equilibrium positions can be regarded as quantum coupled anharmonic oscillators. Solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.</description>

      <title>Vibrational coherences in half-broadband 2D electronic spectroscopy: spectral filtering to identify excited state displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational coherences in ultrafast pump-probe (PP) and 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provide insight into the excited state dynamics of molecules. Femtosecond coherence spectra (FCS) and 2D beat maps yield information about displacements of excited state surfaces for key vibrational modes. Half-broadband 2DES (HB2DES) uses a PP configuration with a white light continuum probe to extend the detection range and resolve vibrational coherences in the excited state absorption (ESA). However, interpretation of these spectra is difficult as they are strongly dependent on the spectrum of the pump laser and the relative displacement of the excited states along the vibrational coordinates. We demonstrate the impact of these convoluting factors for a model based upon cresyl violet. Careful consideration of the position of the pump spectrum can be a powerful tool in resolving the ESA coherences to gain insights into excited state displacements. The paper also highlights the need for caution in considering the spectral window of the pulse when interpreting these spectra.</description>

      <title>A methodology of quantifying membrane permeability based on returning probability theory and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach to estimate the permeability coefficient of substrates (permeants) for crossing membranes from donor (D) phase to acceptor (A) phase by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A fundamental aspect of our approach involves reformulating the returning probability (RP) theory, a rigorous bimolecular reaction theory, to describe permeation phenomena. This reformulation relies on the parallelism between permeation and bimolecular reaction processes. In the present method, the permeability coefficient is represented in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for the reactive (R) phase that exists within the inner region of membranes. One can evaluate these quantities using multiple MD trajectories starting from phase R. We apply the RP theory to the permeation of ethanol and methylamine at different concentrations (infinitely dilute and 1 mol% conditions of permeants). Under the 1 mol% condition, the present method yields a larger permeability coefficient for ethanol ($0.12 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$) than for methylamine ($0.069\pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$), while the values of the permeability coefficient are satisfactorily close to those obtained from the brute-force MD simulations [$0.18\pm 0.03 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ and $0.052 \pm 0.005 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ for ethanol and methylamine, respectively]. Moreover, upon analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the permeability, we clarify that a higher concentration dependency of permeability for ethanol, as compared to methylamine, arises from the sensitive nature of ethanol's free-energy barrier within the inner region of the membrane against ethanol concentration.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>
