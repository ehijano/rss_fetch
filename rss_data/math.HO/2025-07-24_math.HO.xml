      <title>Collapsi is strongly solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collapsi is a two-player game of complete information released in June 2025 by Mark S. Ball of Riffle Shuffle &amp; Roll. Played with two pawns on a toroidal board of 16 randomly mixed playing cards, players take it in turns to move based on the value of the card they sit on, with the game ending when a player has no legal moves. The number of possible deals after symmetry breaking is low enough, and the game tree shallow enough, to make an exhaustive analysis of the game feasible. A solver was written that can find an optimal move for a given board position in around 20 milliseconds. A search was applied revealing that the first player can force a win in 37.5% of deals, with the second player able to force a win in all others. In 6.4% of deals the losing player can prolong the game to the maximum length of 14 plies; a win can never be forced in fewer than 7 plies.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Ishango Bone: Unveiling Prehistoric Mathematical Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ishango Bone, discovered in 1950 near the Semliki River in present-day Democratic Republic of Congo and dated to over 24,000 years ago, features a series of 16 grouped numerical notches arranged across three columns. The interpretation of these markings has long been debated, ranging from numerical intention to decorative symbolism. This study presents a newly identified structural pattern, uncovering four irregularities in the numerical groupings that, when resolved, reveal a consistent internal logic across all three columns. The analysis identifies repeating sums, dualistic pairing structures, and cross-column symmetry, pointing toward a deliberate and complex mathematical arrangement. These findings suggest the notches may have functioned as a form of reference system, potentially using stone markers for visual or narrative purposes. Hypotheses include links to cosmic cycles, mathematical instruction, or mythological integration. While interpretations remain speculative, this study argues for an interdisciplinary reevaluation of the Ishango Bone's significance in terms of mathematical, cultural, and cosmological understanding. It offers new insights into the symbolic thinking and cognitive capacities of prehistoric societies and challenges conventional assumptions about the origins of numeracy.</description>
