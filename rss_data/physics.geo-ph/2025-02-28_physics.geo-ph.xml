      <title>Recorded Versus Synthetic Ground Motions: A Comparative Analysis of Structural Seismic Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of structural seismic responses under two types of ground motion inputs: (i) synthetic motions generated by stochastic ground motion models and (ii) recorded motions from an earthquake database. Five key seismic response metrics - probability distributions, statistical moments, correlations, tail indices, and variance-based global sensitivity indices - are systematically evaluated for two archetypal structures: a 12-story medium-period building and a high-rise long-period tower. Both ground motion datasets are calibrated to a shared response spectrum, ensuring consistency in spectral characteristics, including spectral median, variance, and correlation structure. The analysis incorporates both aleatory uncertainties from ground motion variability and epistemic uncertainties associated with structural parameters, providing a comprehensive comparison of seismic responses. The results demonstrate close agreement in global response characteristics, including distributions, correlations, and sensitivity indices, between synthetic and recorded motions, with differences typically within 15\%. However, significant discrepancies are observed under extreme conditions, particularly in tail behavior, higher-order moments, and drift responses of long-period structures, with differences exceeding 50\%. These discrepancies are attributed to the non-Gaussian features and complex characteristics inherent in recorded motions, which are less pronounced in synthetic datasets. The findings support the use of synthetic ground motions for evaluating global seismic response characteristics, while highlighting their limitations in capturing rare-event behavior and long-period structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Understanding the two-step nucleation of iron at Earth's inner core conditions: a comparative molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metastable phases can lead to multistep nucleation processes, influencing the liquid-to-solid transition in various systems. In this study, we investigate the homogeneous nucleation of iron's crystalline phases under Earth's inner core conditions, employing two previously developed interatomic potentials. We compare the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of iron relevant to the nucleation as predicted by these potentials. While the potentials differ in their predictions of melting temperature by a few hundred Kelvins, they show a consistent description of the relative Gibbs free energy between solid and liquid phases with respect to the undercooling. Both potentials also predict that the metastable bcc phase exhibits a significantly higher nucleation rate than the hcp phase over a wide range of undercooling. This substantially lowers the conditions required for the initial nucleation of Earth's inner core. The results validate the commonality of the two-step nucleation mechanism of iron under Earth's inner core conditions for two different potentials, providing a foundation for future studies about the influence of other elements on the nucleation of Earth's core.</description>

      <title>A New Method for High-Resolution Dating of Radiocarbon Data: The Example of the First Three Centuries B.C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiocarbon dating poses a challenge in many archaeological contexts due to the limited precision of conventional calibration methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to fine-dating that is based on the repeated application of OxCal's R_Simulate function. By constructing extensive reference tables and aggregating measures of central tendency (means and medians), uncalibrated 14C measurements are directly mapped to calendar dates. The method is validated through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with dendrochronologically dated tree rings. Despite challenges in segments of the calibration curve with low gradients, the approach demonstrates that a significant improvement in dating precision is achievable. Limitations and potential avenues for further methodological optimisation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Magnetic Data using Learned Dictionaries and Scale Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.
