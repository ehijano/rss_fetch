      <title>Smarandache curves and their properties on null curves in lightlike cone space $\mathbb{Q}_{2}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the differential geometric properties of Smarandache curves derived from null curves defined in the ligtlike cone space $% Q_{3}^{2}\subset E_{2}^{4}$. The indefinite metric structure causes the null vectors, and hence the null curves, to have a richer geometry in this space than in Euclidean or Minkowski spaces. In this study, we analyse the kinematic properties of the null curve using the null natural Frenet frame $% \{x,\xi ,N,W\}$. We then investigate the bending, torsion, and other geometric invariants of Smarandache curves constructed as linear combinations of these frame vectors (i.e., combinations of tangent, normal, or binormal vectors). The findings reveal how the original properties of the null curve are transferred to the Smarandache curves and how the metric of this particular space affects the characteristics of the Smarandache curves. This analysis provides a new perspective on the relationships between constrained and degenerate structures in differential geometry and light-like particle dynamics in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>A New Special Function and Its Application in Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we present a new special function that behaves like the error function and we provide an approximated accurate closed form for its CDF in terms of both Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and the error function. Also, we provide its series representation using Pad\'e approximant. We show convincing numerical evidence of an accuracy of $10^{-6}$ for the approximants in the sense of the quadratic mean norm. A similar approach may be applied to other probability distributions, for example, the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution and the normal distribution, and we show its application using both of those distributions.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Phase Dunkl Transform: Fundamental properties, translation operators, convolution product and HUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the quadratic-phase Dunkl transform, a novel integral transform on the real line parameterized by five real numbers $(a, b, c, d, e)$ and a multiplicity parameter $\mu\geq -1/2$. We define the transform and establish its fundamental properties, including continuity, a Riemann--Lebesgue lemma, linearity, scaling, and most importantly, a reversibility theorem and an associated Parseval formula. We show that this novel quadratic-phase integral type transform generalizes a wide class of known transforms, such as the quadratic-phase Fourier-Bessel transform, the quadratic-phase Fourier transform, the linear canonical Dunkl transform, the fractional Dunkl transform, and the classical Dunkl transform, by choosing the appropriate specialization of its parameters. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate a corresponding quadratic-phase Dunkl translation operator and a convolution structure, proving their basic properties and a Young's inequality. Finally, we establish a new Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle for the quadratic-phase Dunkl transform, which extends the classical uncertainty principle for a large class of integral type transforms.</description>

      <title>A Continuous-Order Integral Operator for Maclaurin-type Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a continuous-order analog of the Maclaurin expansion that reconstructs analytic functions. This continuous-order Maclaurin-type operator replaces the discrete sum of integer-order derivatives in the classical Maclaurin expansion with an integral over fractional derivative orders, weighted at the evaluation point by x^r/Gamma(r+1). Numerical experiments on a representative set of analytic functions f show that the uncorrected operator reliably tracks the global shape of f, with a systematic, largely constant offset and an additional deviation localized at the origin. Low-order correction terms, motivated by the classical Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, reduce this discrepancy. With these corrections, the operator reconstructs f accurately in the tested domains. The operator reproduces monomials exactly, reflecting the collapse of derivative information to a single order, as in the classical Maclaurin expansion of monomials. This singular collapse motivates a Taylor-centered extension away from the origin, where the order dependence is predicted to be smooth. Taken together, these results suggest that the continuous-order integration operator, with low-order corrections, provides a coherent framework for generalizing the classical Taylor-Maclaurin expansion.</description>

      <title>Preliminaries on Pre-Hilbert Structures on Polynomial Spaces and Associated Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study orthogonal polynomial systems arising from general pre-Hilbert inner products on polynomial spaces, beyond the classical framework of measures. To each such inner product we associate a canonical Laplacian defined from an abstract derivation, and we investigate the operator-theoretic structures induced by this construction.
  Our main contribution is the introduction of a resolvent-based distance between polynomial Hilbert geometries, and the proof of quantitative stability results for finite-degree orthogonalization procedures. In particular, we show that norm-resolvent closeness of the associated Laplacians implies stability of Gram--Schmidt orthogonal bases, orthogonal projectors and reproducing kernels on all finite-dimensional polynomial subspaces.
  The general theory is illustrated by several explicit examples. We analyze in detail the case of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, comparing classical $L^2$ geometries associated with finite Radon measures and Sobolev-type regularizations via Fourier methods. We also revisit the thin annulus problem, showing that its asymptotic regime admits a natural interpretation as a resolvent limit of polynomial geometries.
  These results provide a unified operator-theoretic framework for the study of stability, degenerations and geometric limits of orthogonal polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Projection onto the parabola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide explicit expressions for the projections onto the graph of a quadratic polynomial. The projections are obtained by examining the critical points of the associated quartic polynomial, that is, the roots of the cubic polynomial defining its derivative. We also focus on the case where the point we project lies on the vertical line defined by the parabola. Lastly, an explicit formula for the projection onto a higher dimensional parabola is derived.</description>

Abstract: In this article, I present a theorem determining a criterion for divisibility of two generalized Mersenne numbers, which are repunits of the same length in base-$a^m$ and base-$a^k$. In addition to the general proof, I present an alternative proof for a special case of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Iterating sum of power divisor function and New equivalence to the Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of the iterated sum-of-divisors function $\sigma_k(m)$ and its behaviour modulo $m$, motivated by classical questions on perfect and multiperfect numbers and by the congruences $\sigma_k(m) \equiv 0 \pmod m$. Perfect and multiperfect numbers remain extremely rare; odd perfect numbers are still unknown and must be astronomically large. Here, the emphasis is on the dynamical and statistical structure of the iterates rather than on isolated examples.
  Three main results are obtained. First, it is proved that no integer $m&gt;1$ can satisfy $\sigma_k(m) \equiv 0 \pmod m$ for all $k \ge 0$, thereby ruling out the existence of "metaperfect" numbers and showing that the iteration of $\sigma$ cannot remain permanently trapped in the residue class $0$ modulo $m$. Second, for certain explicit integers such as $m=6,12,24$, the sequence $\sigma_k(m) \bmod m$ is strictly periodic with small period dividing $L=\mathrm{lcm}(e_i+1)$, where the $e_i$ are the prime exponents of $m$. Bifurcation plots and distributional analysis reveal a transition from rigid two-cycle structure to more complex residue dynamics as $m$ increases. Third, a new equivalence with the Riemann Hypothesis is established: RH holds if and only if, for every even non-squarefree $m \ge 5041$ containing a prime fifth power, \[ \frac{\sigma_k(m)}{\sigma_{k-1}(m)\log\log\sigma_{k-1}(m)} \le e^\gamma, \] and the sequence $\sigma_k(m) \bmod m$ is eventually periodic, uniformly in $k \ge 0$. Extensive computations support these periodicity phenomena, yield non-normal discrete distribution models for the residues, and suggest a connection with a newly proposed Schrodinger-type "Caceres" operator whose spectrum numerically reproduces key statistical features of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.</description>
