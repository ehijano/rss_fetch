      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Tangential Forces Govern the Viscous-Inertial Transition in Dense Frictional Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present particle-resolved simulations of dense frictional suspensions undergoing the viscous-inertial transition using pressure-imposed rheology. By varying the fluid viscosity, shear rate, and granular pressure, we find that the transition is independent of the packing fraction and occurs at a Stokes number of 10. Our results reveal that the shear stress exhibits a slower transition than the particle pressure, attributed to the combined effect of tangential contact and lubrication forces, as the frictional particles concurrently shift from rolling to sliding contacts. This shift is controlled by the Stokes number but also by the distance from jamming. Additionally, we examine the role of increasing inter-particle friction on the viscous-inertial transition.</description>

      <title>All-DNA associative polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between "sticker" sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or \textit{via} a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we numerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where "sticker" sites made by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types, $(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled way.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and anti-tunneling across entropic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum particle in a constricted two-dimensional channel and analyze how the onset of quantum corrections impacts the (semi-)classical high-temperature behaviour, as temperature is lowered. We characterize both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (transport) properties of the system, considering the case of a narrow and disorder-free channel. Counterintuitively, we find that quantum corrections do not monotonically enhance the particle current as the temperature is lowered, as naively expected from the activation of coherent tunnelling, but they rather inhibit transport at intermediate temperatures, increasing the effective free-energy barrier. We illustrate this ``anti-tunnelling'' effect numerically by computing the non-equilibrium steady-state of a quantum master equation describing the system, and confirm it analytically by adopting the Quantum Smoluchowski limit.</description>

      <title>Sound Attenuation in Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. Despite decades of studies, the underlying mechanism of sound damping in glasses is still debated. In this perspective we review recent work on sound damping in amorphous solids. We focus on the role of defects, heterogeneous elasticity, and damping in model amorphous solids without defects. We review our definition of damping defects and show that they strongly influence sound damping. However, we also find another contribution to sound damping that cannot be attributed to damping defects. We confirm an earlier result of Kapteijns et al. [G. Kapteijns et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 081101 (2021)] that heterogeneous elasticity theory predicts relative changes of sound damping in model two-dimensional glasses if the configuration-to-configuration elastic constants fluctuations are used to quantify the heterogeneity. We extend this finding to similar three-dimensional glasses. We end by discussing the Euclidean Random Matrix model, which exhibits Rayleigh scaling of sound damping, but does not have quasi-localized excitations, and thus probably does not have sound damping defects. We propose that the mechanisms behind sound damping can be more fully understood by approaching the problem from two directions, one where the strong influence of defects is studied and another where sound damping is studied in defect free albeit disordered materials.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Theory of Electrochemical Ostwald Ripening for Electrodeposited Lithium Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of lithium nuclei under the competing effects of electroplating and surface energy-driven redistribution (electrochemical Ostwald ripening). Our model introduces a formulation that accounts for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance, electrolyte conductivity, and electrode wettability, capturing the transition from SEI to electrolyte-limited growth regimes. We identify asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The results reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic efficiency. Based on these insights, we outline experimentally accessible guidelines to improve battery efficiency and cycling stability - offering a simple yet predictive approach for optimizing metal electrodeposition processes in battery systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Geometric control and memory in networks of hysteretic elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of driven frustrated media stems from interacting hysteretic elements. We derive explicit mappings from networks of hysteretic springs to their abstract representation as interacting hysterons. These maps reveal how the physical network controls the signs, magnitudes, symmetries, and pair-wise nature of the hysteron interactions. In addition, strong geometric nonlinearities can produce pathways that require excess hysterons or even break hysteron models. Our results pave the way for metamaterials with geometrically controlled interactions, pathways, and functionalities, and highlight fundamental limitations of abstract hysterons in modeling disordered systems.</description>

      <title>A Fluctuation Theory of Liquid-Phase Solutions: Shear Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant concern in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as outlined by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Swelling Kinetics of pNIPAM Lyogels: The Role of Crosslinking, Copolymerization, and Solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive lyogels are known for their ability to undergo significant macroscopic changes when exposed to external stimuli. While thermo-responsive gels, such as poly N isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), have been extensively studied across various applications, solvent-induced swelling has predominantly been investigated in aqueous solutions. This study explores the tailoring of lyogel formulations for future applications by controlling their solvent-induced swelling behavior, comparing both homopolymeric and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs). In contrast to most previous studies, the impact of chemical and physical crosslinking, as well as copolymer inclusion, on the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of lyogels in organic solvents is examined and compared with solvent-induced swelling kinetics measurements. The results demonstrate that increasing chemically crosslinking in homopolymers and physically crosslinking in semi-IPNs enhances mechanical stability, while improving mass transport properties and solvent exchange kinetics. However, increases degree of crosslinking results in a prolonged response time to the solvent exchange stimulus and a reduction in the overall swelling capacity of the lyogels. Furthermore, variations in solvent properties, including molecular size and diffusion rates, significantly influence the swelling kinetics, whereas smaller, faster-diffusing solvents leading to more pronounced solvent spillage effects. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between gel formulation, network structure, and solvent nature in determining the solvent-induced swelling kinetics of lyogels, providing insights into how these materials can be tailored for specific applications especially those requiring short response times and optimized mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>
