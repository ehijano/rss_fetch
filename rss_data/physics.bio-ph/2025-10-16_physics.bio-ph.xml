      <title>Quantum modeling of radical pair magnetic sensor based on electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoreduction of cryptochrome protein in the retina is a well-known mechanism of navigation of birds through the geomagnetic field, yet the biosignal nature of the mechanism remains unclear. The absorption of blue light by the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore can alter the distribution of electrons in cryptochrome and create radical pairs with separated charges. In this study, the spin dynamics of electrons in the radical pair and its coupling with spatial position were investigated by computational modeling from a quantum mechanical perspective. Several interactions were considered in the presence of an external magnetic field, and the resulting electric dipole moment in cryptochrome was computed as the quantity emerging from this coupling. The computations show the induced electric dipole moment clearly depend on the characteristics of the applied magnetic field even after considering dissipative effects. In fact, our findings indicate that the radical pair in cryptochrome protein is a magnetic biosensor, in the sense that in the presence of the geomagnetic field, variations in spin states can influence its electric dipole moment, which may be interpreted via the bird as an orientation signal. The results can be used in the advancement of bio-inspired technologies which replicate animal magnetic sensitivity. On the other hand, with increasing concern about the detrimental effects of electromagnetic fields on wildlife and human health, studying the phenomenon of magnetoreception can contribute to a deeper understanding of how biological structures interact with these fields.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy DNA Bubble Dynamics via the Quantum Coulomb Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a low-energy model that can be used at any time to describe the dynamics of DNA bubbles at temperatures below the melting point. The Schr\"odinger equation associated with this problem is solved in imaginary time with a quantum Coulomb potential, and we obtain an approximate expression for its more general physical solution as a linear combination of the states whose energies are close to the lower bound energy. We can then determine the probability density, the first-passage time density, and the correlation functions in terms of Bessel functions. Our findings are consistent with results obtained directly from the Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with the Gamma and Diffusion models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topology promotes length exploration in microtubule dynamic instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microtubules stochastically switch between growth and shrinkage during catastrophe events across a very large range of filament lengths, with the length distribution at catastrophe peaking at a finite filament length, which can aid the search for chromosomes during mitosis. To model these distinct features, we introduce a topological model of a two-component microtubule cap, where protected edge states give rise to different phases of microtubule dynamics - growth, shrinkage, and a recently observed "stutter" phase. With only two free parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the peaked catastrophe length distribution and its dependence on tubulin concentration from experimental data. The model further provides an analytical condition for when the catastrophe length distribution is peaked. Our work shows how microtubules may utilize topological edge states to promote length exploration, elucidating a novel mechanism for search and target reaching in cellular biology.</description>

      <title>Living Capillary Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit complex behaviors with their dynamics often resembling inert soft matter such as liquids, polymers, colloids, and liquid crystals. These analogies enable physics-based approaches for investigations of emergent behaviors in biological processes. A well-studied case is the spreading of cellular aggregates on solid surfaces, where they display dynamics similar to viscous droplets. \textit{In vivo}, however, cells and tissues are in a confined environment with varying geometries and mechanical properties to which they need to adapt. In this work, we compressed cellular aggregates between two solid surfaces and studied their dynamics using microscopy, and computer simulations. The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from compressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge thinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that the stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth and cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge rupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the plates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living capillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that included cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how mechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular aggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and cell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we propose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates exhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized rupturing driven by biological activity.</description>

      <title>Sound Masking Strategies for Interference with Mosquito Hearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of auditory masking has long been of interest in psychoacoustics and for engineering purposes, in order to cover sounds that are disruptive to humans or to species whose habitats overlap with ours. In most cases, we seek to minimize the disturbances to the communication of wildlife. However, in the case of pathogen-carrying insects, we may want to maximize these disturbances as a way to control populations. In the current work, we explore candidate masking strategies for a generic model of active auditory systems and a model of the mosquito auditory system. For both models, we find that masks with all acoustic power focused into just one or a few frequencies perform best. We propose that masks based on rapid frequency modulation are most effective for maximal disruption of information transfer and minimizing intelligibility. We hope that these results will serve to guide the avoidance or selection of possible acoustic signals for, respectively, maximizing or minimizing communication.</description>

      <title>Research Progress of Terahertz Technology in Microbiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature, and microbial activities are closely intertwined with the entire life cycle system and human life. Developing novel technologies for the detection, characterization and manipulation of microorganisms promotes their applications in clinical, environmental and industrial areas. Over the last two decades, terahertz (THz) technology has emerged as a new optical tool for microbiology. The great potential originates from the unique advantages of THz waves including the high sensitivity to water and inter-/intra-molecular motions, the non-invasive and label-free detecting scheme, and their low photon energy. THz waves have been utilized as a stimulus to alter microbial functions, or as a sensing approach for quantitative measurement and qualitative differentiation. This review specifically focuses on recent research progress of THz technology applied in the field of microbiology, including two major parts of THz biological effects and the microbial detection applications. In the end of this paper, we summarize the research progress and discuss the challenges currently faced by THz technology in microbiology, along with potential solutions. We also provide a perspective on future development directions. This review aims to build a bridge between THz photonics and microbiology, promoting both fundamental research and application development in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Run-and-Tumble-Like Dynamics in a Robotic Analog of \textit{Chlamydomonas}: Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. One such example is a biflagellated alga, called \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}. Its flagellar synchronization is not only affected by hydrodynamic interactions but also through contractile stress fibers that mechanically couple the flagella, enabling adaptable swimming behavior. To explore this, we design a macroscopic mechanical system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model this organism. By varying the attachment points of the two ends of the rod on each robot, the model incorporates the effect of fiber contractility observed in the real organism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp, direction-reversing tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with the real organism. Moreover, we quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics. Thus, our robotic system not only replicates RT motion but also captures several subtle characteristics, offering valuable insights into the underlying physics of microswimmer motility.</description>

      <title>BoltzNCE: Learning Likelihoods for Boltzmann Generation with Stochastic Interpolants and Noise Contrastive Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution given its energy function is a key challenge for modeling complex physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators address this problem by leveraging continuous normalizing flows to transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the target using sample likelihoods. Despite the elegance of this approach, obtaining these likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, which is impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this difficulty, we train an energy-based model (EBM) to approximate likelihoods using both noise contrastive estimation (NCE) and score matching, which we show outperforms the use of either objective in isolation. On 2d synthetic systems where failure can be easily visualized, NCE improves mode weighting relative to score matching alone. On alanine dipeptide, our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions that closely match those obtained using exact likelihoods while achieving $100\times$ faster inference. By training on multiple dipeptide systems, we show that our approach also exhibits effective transfer learning, generalizing to new systems at inference time and achieving at least a $6\times$ speedup over standard MD. While many recent efforts in generative modeling have prioritized models with fast sampling, our work demonstrates the design of models with accelerated likelihoods, enabling the application of reweighting schemes that ensure unbiased Boltzmann statistics at scale.

      <title>Advanced X-rays techniques for research-oriented high-resolution imaging of articular cartilage: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articular cartilage is a musculoskeletal soft tissue renowned for its unique mechanical properties. Understanding both its hierarchical structure and the interplay between its constituents could shed light on the mechanical competence of the tissue. Therefore, rheologic approaches based on high-resolution non-destructive imaging techniques are desired. In this context, X-ray imaging could ideally accomplish this task. Nevertheless, the nature of articular cartilage translates into poor contrast using conventional absorption modality. To overcome this limitation, several approaches can be embraced. X-ray visibility of articular cartilage can be increased with the use of radiopaque contrast agents. Therefore, further discrimination of structures could be provided by spectral techniques, pivoting on either multi-energy acquisitions or photon-counting technology. Alternatively, phase-contrast techniques unveil details typically undetected with conventional approaches. Phase-contrast imaging, based on the intrinsic decrement in the refractive index of the tissue, can be achieved with different configurations and implementations, including distinct X-ray sources and optical elements. Additionally, some phase-contrast techniques retrieve the small-angle scattering-based dark-field signal, relatable to sub-pixel structures. This scoping review aims to catalogue the application of these advanced X-ray techniques to articular cartilage imaging, following PRISMA guidelines. It discusses their advantages, limitations, and includes an overview of rheologic applications to articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>
