      <title>Weather-Informed Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power grids presents significant challenges due to their intrinsic stochasticity and uncertainty, necessitating the development of new techniques for reliable and efficient forecasting. This paper proposes a method combining probabilistic forecasting and Gaussian copula for day-ahead prediction and scenario generation of load, wind, and solar power in high-dimensional contexts. By incorporating weather covariates and restoring spatio-temporal correlations, the proposed method enhances the reliability of probabilistic forecasts in RES. Extensive numerical experiments compare the effectiveness of different time series models, with performance evaluated using comprehensive metrics on a real-world and high-dimensional dataset from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The results highlight the importance of weather information and demonstrate the efficacy of the Gaussian copula in generating realistic scenarios, with the proposed weather-informed Temporal Fusion Transformer (WI-TFT) model showing superior performance.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bounds in Distributed Point Target Tracking over Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays a key role in the development of autonomous systems, decision-making, and tracking over wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, there is a need of providing uncertainty confidence bounds, especially for distributed machine learning-based tracking, dealing with different volumes of data collected by sensors. This paper aims to fill in this gap and proposes a distributed Gaussian process (DGP) approach for point target tracking and derives upper confidence bounds (UCBs) of the state estimates. A unique contribution of this paper includes the derived theoretical guarantees on the proposed approach and its maximum accuracy for tracking with and without clutter measurements. Particularly, the developed approaches with uncertainty bounds are generic and can provide trustworthy solutions with an increased level of reliability. A novel hybrid Bayesian filtering method is proposed to enhance the DGP approach by adopting a Poisson measurement likelihood model. The proposed approaches are validated over a WSN case study, where sensors have limited sensing ranges. Numerical results demonstrate the tracking accuracy and robustness of the proposed approaches. The derived UCBs constitute a tool for trustworthiness evaluation of DGP approaches. The simulation results reveal that the proposed UCBs successfully encompass the true target states with 88% and 42% higher probability in X and Y coordinates, respectively, when compared to the confidence interval-based method.</description>

      <title>Ratio Divergence Learning Using Target Energy in Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Beyond Kullback--Leibler Divergence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ratio divergence (RD) learning for discrete energy-based models, a method that utilizes both training data and a tractable target energy function. We apply RD learning to restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are a minimal model that satisfies the universal approximation theorem for discrete distributions. RD learning combines the strength of both forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) learning, effectively addressing the "notorious" issues of underfitting with the forward KLD and mode-collapse with the reverse KLD. Since the summation of forward and reverse KLD seems to be sufficient to combine the strength of both approaches, we include this learning method as a direct baseline in numerical experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that RD learning significantly outperforms other learning methods in terms of energy function fitting, mode-covering, and learning stability across various discrete energy-based models. Moreover, the performance gaps between RD learning and the other learning methods become more pronounced as the dimensions of target models increase.</description>

      <title>Critically Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While systems analysis has been studied for decades in the context of control theory, it has only been recently used to improve the convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This work describes a novel improvement to Third- Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD), a recent diffusion method that performs better than its predecessors. This improvement, abbreviated TOLD++, is carried out by critically damping the TOLD forward transition matrix similarly to Dockhorn's Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD). Specifically, it exploits eigen-analysis of the forward transition matrix to derive the optimal set of dynamics under the original TOLD scheme. TOLD++ is theoretically guaranteed to converge faster than TOLD, and its faster convergence is verified on the Swiss Roll toy dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset according to the FID metric.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization method such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers, In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on a statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis which is that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., in the case the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero).</description>

      <title>Randomized Spline Trees for Functional Data Classification: Theory and Application to Environmental Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional data analysis (FDA) and ensemble learning can be powerful tools for analyzing complex environmental time series. Recent literature has highlighted the key role of diversity in enhancing accuracy and reducing variance in ensemble methods.This paper introduces Randomized Spline Trees (RST), a novel algorithm that bridges these two approaches by incorporating randomized functional representations into the Random Forest framework. RST generates diverse functional representations of input data using randomized B-spline parameters, creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on these varied representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of how this functional diversity contributes to reducing generalization error and present empirical evaluations on six environmental time series classification tasks from the UCR Time Series Archive. Results show that RST variants outperform standard Random Forests and Gradient Boosting on most datasets, improving classification accuracy by up to 14\%. The success of RST demonstrates the potential of adaptive functional representations in capturing complex temporal patterns in environmental data. This work contributes to the growing field of machine learning techniques focused on functional data and opens new avenues for research in environmental time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Localized Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generative problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. A key bottleneck of this approach is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. As for the original approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a Gaussian problem with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

      <title>Debiased high-dimensional regression calibration for errors-in-variables log-contrast models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenges in analyzing gut microbiome and metagenomic data, this work aims to tackle the issue of measurement errors in high-dimensional regression models that involve compositional covariates. This paper marks a pioneering effort in conducting statistical inference on high-dimensional compositional data affected by mismeasured or contaminated data. We introduce a calibration approach tailored for the linear log-contrast model. Under relatively lenient conditions regarding the sparsity level of the parameter, we have established the asymptotic normality of the estimator for inference. Numerical experiments and an application in microbiome study have demonstrated the efficacy of our high-dimensional calibration strategy in minimizing bias and achieving the expected coverage rates for confidence intervals. Moreover, the potential application of our proposed methodology extends well beyond compositional data, suggesting its adaptability for a wide range of research contexts.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Pairwise Interactions from Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise interactions between perturbations to a system can provide evidence for the causal dependencies of the underlying underlying mechanisms of a system. When observations are low dimensional, hand crafted measurements, detecting interactions amounts to simple statistical tests, but it is not obvious how to detect interactions between perturbations affecting latent variables. We derive two interaction tests that are based on pairwise interventions, and show how these tests can be integrated into an active learning pipeline to efficiently discover pairwise interactions between perturbations. We illustrate the value of these tests in the context of biology, where pairwise perturbation experiments are frequently used to reveal interactions that are not observable from any single perturbation. Our tests can be run on unstructured data, such as the pixels in an image, which enables a more general notion of interaction than typical cell viability experiments, and can be run on cheaper experimental assays. We validate on several synthetic and real biological experiments that our tests are able to identify interacting pairs effectively. We evaluate our approach on a real biological experiment where we knocked out 50 pairs of genes and measured the effect with microscopy images. We show that we are able to recover significantly more known biological interactions than random search and standard active learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Review of Recent Advances in Gaussian Process Regression Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) methods have been widely studied recently, especially for large-scale systems with big data and even more extreme cases when data is sparse. Key advantages of these methods consist in: 1) the ability to provide inherent ways to assess the impact of uncertainties (especially in the data, and environment) on the solutions, 2) have efficient factorisation based implementations and 3) can be implemented easily in distributed manners and hence provide scalable solutions. This paper reviews the recently developed key factorised GP methods such as the hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank approximation methods and GP with Kronecker structures. An example illustrates the performance of these methods with respect to accuracy and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Two-Sample Testing under Right-Censored Data: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) methods for two-sample testing with right-censored observations. To achieve this, we develop several ML-based methods with varying architectures and implement them as two-sample tests. Each method is an ensemble (stacking) that combines predictions from classical two-sample tests. This paper presents the results of training the proposed ML methods, examines their statistical power compared to classical two-sample tests, analyzes the distribution of test statistics for the proposed methods when the null hypothesis is true, and evaluates the significance of the features incorporated into the proposed methods. All results from numerical experiments were obtained from a synthetic dataset generated using the Smirnov transform (Inverse Transform Sampling) and replicated multiple times through Monte Carlo simulation. To test the two-sample problem with right-censored observations, one can use the proposed two-sample methods. All necessary materials (source code, example scripts, dataset, and samples) are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the first asymptotically optimal strategy for a multi armed bandit (MAB) model under side constraints. The side constraints model situations in which bandit activations are limited by the availability of certain resources that are replenished at a constant rate. The main result involves the derivation of an asymptotic lower bound for the regret of feasible uniformly fast policies and the construction of policies that achieve this lower bound, under pertinent conditions. Further, we provide the explicit form of such policies for the case in which the unknown distributions are Normal with unknown means and known variances, for the case of Normal distributions with unknown means and unknown variances and for the case of arbitrary discrete distributions with finite support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a versatile method that enables different approaches towards learning for dynamics and control. Gaussianity assumptions appear in two dimensions in GPs: The positive semi-definite kernel of the underlying reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to construct the co-variance of a Gaussian distribution over functions, while measurement noise (i.e. data corruption) is usually modeled as i.i.d. additive Gaussians. In this note, we generalize the setting and consider kernel ridge regression with additive i.i.d. non-Gaussian measurement noise. To apply the usual kernel trick, we rely on the representation of the uncertainty via polynomial chaos expansions, which are series expansions for random variables of finite variance introduced by Norbert Wiener. We derive and discuss the analytic $\mathcal{L}^2$ solution to the arising Wiener kernel regression. Considering a polynomial dynamic system as a numerical example, we show that our approach allows us to distinguish the uncertainty that stems from the noise in the data samples from the total uncertainty encoded in the GP posterior distribution.</description>

Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this letter, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we show that under certain conditions, learning period three can embed attractors with all periods into the network as a bifurcation after learning. The associated universality is explained by a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding epoch-wise double descent in two-layer linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epoch-wise double descent is the phenomenon where generalisation performance improves beyond the point of overfitting, resulting in a generalisation curve exhibiting two descents under the course of learning. Understanding the mechanisms driving this behaviour is crucial not only for understanding the generalisation behaviour of machine learning models in general, but also for employing conventional selection methods, such as the use of early stopping to mitigate overfitting. While we ultimately want to draw conclusions of more complex models, such as deep neural networks, a majority of theoretical results regarding the underlying cause of epoch-wise double descent are based on simple models, such as standard linear regression. In this paper, to take a step towards more complex models in theoretical analysis, we study epoch-wise double descent in two-layer linear neural networks. First, we derive a gradient flow for the linear two-layer model, that bridges the learning dynamics of the standard linear regression model, and the linear two-layer diagonal network with quadratic weights. Second, we identify additional factors of epoch-wise double descent emerging with the extra model layer, by deriving necessary conditions for the generalisation error to follow a double descent pattern. While epoch-wise double descent in linear regression has been attributed to differences in input variance, in the two-layer model, also the singular values of the input-output covariance matrix play an important role. This opens up for further questions regarding unidentified factors of epoch-wise double descent for truly deep models.</description>

      <title>Deep Limit Model-free Prediction in Regression</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel Model-free approach based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) to accomplish point prediction and prediction interval under a general regression setting. Usually, people rely on parametric or non-parametric models to bridge dependent and independent variables (Y and X). However, this classical method relies heavily on the correct model specification. Even for the non-parametric approach, some additive form is often assumed. A newly proposed Model-free prediction principle sheds light on a prediction procedure without any model assumption. Previous work regarding this principle has shown better performance than other standard alternatives. Recently, DNN, one of the machine learning methods, has received increasing attention due to its great performance in practice. Guided by the Model-free prediction idea, we attempt to apply a fully connected forward DNN to map X and some appropriate reference random variable Z to Y. The targeted DNN is trained by minimizing a specially designed loss function so that the randomness of Y conditional on X is outsourced to Z through the trained DNN. Our method is more stable and accurate compared to other DNN-based counterparts, especially for optimal point predictions. With a specific prediction procedure, our prediction interval can capture the estimation variability so that it can render a better coverage rate for finite sample cases. The superior performance of our method is verified by simulation and empirical studies.</description>

Abstract: $\textit{Restless Bandits}$ describe sequential decision-making problems in which the rewards evolve with time independently from the actions taken by the policy-maker. It has been shown that classical Bandit algorithms fail when the underlying environment is changing, making clear that in order to tackle more challenging scenarios specifically crafted algorithms are needed. In this paper, extending and correcting the work by \cite{trovo2020sliding}, we analyze two Thompson-Sampling inspired algorithms, namely $\texttt{BETA-SWTS}$ and $\texttt{$\gamma$-SWGTS}$, introduced to face the additional complexity given by the non-stationary nature of the settings; in particular we derive a general formulation for the regret in $\textit{any}$ arbitrary restless environment for both Bernoulli and Subgaussian rewards, and, through the introduction of new quantities, we delve in what contribution lays the deeper foundations of the error made by the algorithms. Finally, we infer from the general formulation the regret for two of the most common non-stationary settings: the $\textit{Abruptly Changing}$ and the $\textit{Smoothly Changing}$ environments.</description>

      <title>Identification and multiply robust estimation in causal mediation analysis across principal strata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider assessing causal mediation in the presence of a post-treatment event (examples include noncompliance, a clinical event, or death). We identify natural mediation effects for the entire study population and for each principal stratum characterized by the joint potential values of the post-treatment event. We derive the efficient influence function for each mediation estimand, which motivates a set of multiply robust estimators for inference. The multiply robust estimators are consistent under four types of misspecifications and are efficient when all nuisance models are correctly specified. We also develop a nonparametric efficient estimator that leverages data-adaptive machine learners to achieve efficient inference and discuss sensitivity methods to address key identification assumptions. We illustrate our methods via simulations and two real data examples.</description>

      <title>Identifiable causal inference with noisy treatment and no side information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some causal inference scenarios, the treatment variable is measured inaccurately, for instance in epidemiology or econometrics. Failure to correct for the effect of this measurement error can lead to biased causal effect estimates. Previous research has not studied methods that address this issue from a causal viewpoint while allowing for complex nonlinear dependencies and without assuming access to side information. For such a scenario, this study proposes a model that assumes a continuous treatment variable that is inaccurately measured. Building on existing results for measurement error models, we prove that our model's causal effect estimates are identifiable, even without side information and knowledge of the measurement error variance. Our method relies on a deep latent variable model in which Gaussian conditionals are parameterized by neural networks, and we develop an amortized importance-weighted variational objective for training the model. Empirical results demonstrate the method's good performance with unknown measurement error. More broadly, our work extends the range of applications in which reliable causal inference can be conducted.</description>

      <title>KL Convergence Guarantees for Score diffusion models under minimal data assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that revolve around the estimation of the score function associated with a stochastic differential equation. Subsequent to its acquisition, the approximated score function is then harnessed to simulate the corresponding time-reversal process, ultimately enabling the generation of approximate data samples. Despite their evident practical significance these models carry, a notable challenge persists in the form of a lack of comprehensive quantitative results, especially in scenarios involving non-regular scores and estimators. In almost all reported bounds in Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence, it is assumed that either the score function or its approximation is Lipschitz uniformly in time. However, this condition is very restrictive in practice or appears to be difficult to establish. To circumvent this issue, previous works mainly focused on establishing convergence bounds in KL for an early stopped version of the diffusion model and a smoothed version of the data distribution, or assuming that the data distribution is supported on a compact manifold. These explorations have led to interesting bounds in either Wasserstein or Fortet-Mourier metrics. However, the question remains about the relevance of such early-stopping procedure or compactness conditions. In particular, if there exist a natural and mild condition ensuring explicit and sharp convergence bounds in KL. In this article, we tackle the aforementioned limitations by focusing on score diffusion models with fixed step size stemming from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and its kinetic counterpart. Our study provides a rigorous analysis, yielding simple, improved and sharp convergence bounds in KL applicable to any data distribution with finite Fisher information with respect to the standard Gaussian distribution.</description>

Abstract: Forward marginal effects have recently been introduced as a versatile and effective model-agnostic interpretation method particularly suited for non-linear and non-parametric prediction models. They provide comprehensible model explanations of the form: if we change feature values by a pre-specified step size, what is the change in the predicted outcome? We present the R package fmeffects, the first software implementation of the theory surrounding forward marginal effects. The relevant theoretical background, package functionality and handling, as well as the software design and options for future extensions are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding approximate stationary points, i.e., points where the gradient is approximately zero, of non-convex but smooth objective functions $f$ over unrestricted $d$-dimensional domains is one of the most fundamental problems in classical non-convex optimization. Nevertheless, the computational and query complexity of this problem are still not well understood when the dimension $d$ of the problem is independent of the approximation error. In this paper, we show the following computational and query complexity results:
  1. The problem of finding approximate stationary points over unrestricted domains is PLS-complete.
  2. For $d = 2$, we provide a zero-order algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary points that requires at most $O(1/\varepsilon)$ value queries to the objective function.
  3. We show that any algorithm needs at least $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to the objective function and/or its gradient to find $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary points when $d=2$. Combined with the above, this characterizes the query complexity of this problem to be $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$.
  4. For $d = 2$, we provide a zero-order algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-KKT points in constrained optimization problems that requires at most $O(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ value queries to the objective function. This closes the gap between the works of Bubeck and Mikulincer [2020] and Vavasis [1993] and characterizes the query complexity of this problem to be $\Theta(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$.
  5. Combining our results with the recent result of Fearnley et al. [2022], we show that finding approximate KKT points in constrained optimization is reducible to finding approximate stationary points in unconstrained optimization but the converse is impossible.</description>

      <title>SymmPI: Predictive Inference for Data with Group Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions is a core problem in modern statistics. Methods for predictive inference have been developed under a variety of assumptions, often -- for instance, in standard conformal prediction -- relying on the invariance of the distribution of the data under special groups of transformations such as permutation groups. Moreover, many existing methods for predictive inference aim to predict unobserved outcomes in sequences of feature-outcome observations. Meanwhile, there is interest in predictive inference under more general observation models (e.g., for partially observed features) and for data satisfying more general distributional symmetries (e.g., rotationally invariant or coordinate-independent observations in physics). Here we propose SymmPI, a methodology for predictive inference when data distributions have general group symmetries in arbitrary observation models. Our methods leverage the novel notion of distributional equivariant transformations, which process the data while preserving their distributional invariances. We show that SymmPI has valid coverage under distributional invariance and characterize its performance under distribution shift, recovering recent results as special cases. We apply SymmPI to predict unobserved values associated to vertices in a network, where the distribution is unchanged under relabelings that keep the network structure unchanged. In several simulations in a two-layer hierarchical model, and in an empirical data analysis example, SymmPI performs favorably compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Training Rate and Survival Heuristic for Inference and Robustness Evaluation (TRASHFIRE)</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models -- deep neural networks in particular -- have performed remarkably well on benchmark datasets across a wide variety of domains. However, the ease of finding adversarial counter-examples remains a persistent problem when training times are measured in hours or days and the time needed to find a successful adversarial counter-example is measured in seconds. Much work has gone into generating and defending against these adversarial counter-examples, however the relative costs of attacks and defences are rarely discussed. Additionally, machine learning research is almost entirely guided by test/train metrics, but these would require billions of samples to meet industry standards. The present work addresses the problem of understanding and predicting how particular model hyper-parameters influence the performance of a model in the presence of an adversary. The proposed approach uses survival models, worst-case examples, and a cost-aware analysis to precisely and accurately reject a particular model change during routine model training procedures rather than relying on real-world deployment, expensive formal verification methods, or accurate simulations of very complicated systems (\textit{e.g.}, digitally recreating every part of a car or a plane). Through an evaluation of many pre-processing techniques, adversarial counter-examples, and neural network configurations, the conclusion is that deeper models do offer marginal gains in survival times compared to more shallow counterparts. However, we show that those gains are driven more by the model inference time than inherent robustness properties. Using the proposed methodology, we show that ResNet is hopelessly insecure against even the simplest of white box attacks.</description>

Abstract: Community detection in multi-layer networks has emerged as a crucial area of modern network analysis. However, conventional approaches often assume that nodes belong exclusively to a single community, which fails to capture the complex structure of real-world networks where nodes may belong to multiple communities simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose novel spectral methods to estimate the common mixed memberships in the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. The proposed methods leverage the eigen-decomposition of three aggregate matrices: the sum of adjacency matrices, the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices, and the sum of squared adjacency matrices. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the consistency of our methods. Specifically, we derive per-node error rates under mild conditions on network sparsity, demonstrating their consistency as the number of nodes and/or layers increases under the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. Our theoretical results reveal that the method leveraging the sum of adjacency matrices generally performs poorer than the other two methods for mixed membership estimation in multi-layer networks. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to empirically validate our theoretical findings. For real-world multi-layer networks with unknown community information, we introduce two novel modularity metrics to quantify the quality of mixed membership community detection. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of our algorithms and modularity metrics by applying them to real-world multi-layer networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in extracting meaningful community structures.</description>

      <title>Biology-inspired joint distribution neurons based on Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction allowing for multidirectional neural networks</title>

Abstract: Biological neural networks seem qualitatively superior (e.g. in learning, flexibility, robustness) to current artificial like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Simultaneously, in contrast to them: biological have fundamentally multidirectional signal propagation~\cite{axon}, also of probability distributions e.g. for uncertainty estimation, and are believed not being able to use standard backpropagation training~\cite{backprop}. There are proposed novel artificial neurons based on HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) allowing to remove the above low level differences: with neurons containing local joint distribution model (of its connections), representing joint density on normalized variables as just linear combination of $(f_\mathbf{j})$ orthonormal polynomials: $\rho(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{\mathbf{j}\in B} a_\mathbf{j} f_\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^d$ and $B$ some chosen basis, approaching complete description of joint distribution with basis growth. By various index summations of such $(a_\mathbf{j})$ tensor as neuron parameters, we get simple formulas for e.g. conditional expected values for propagation in any direction, like $E[x|y,z]$, $E[y|x]$, which degenerate to KAN-like parametrization if restricting to pairwise dependencies. Such HCR network can also propagate probability distributions (also joint) like $\rho(y,z|x)$. It also allows for additional training approaches, like direct $(a_\mathbf{j})$ estimation, through tensor decomposition, or more biologically plausible information bottleneck training: layers directly influencing only neighbors, optimizing content to maximize information about the next layer, and minimizing about the previous to remove noise, extract crucial information.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.
