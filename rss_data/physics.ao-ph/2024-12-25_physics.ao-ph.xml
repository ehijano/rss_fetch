      <title>Assimilating Observed Surface Pressure into ML Weather Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge in development of accurate machine learning (ML) weather prediction models, but evaluation of these models has mainly been focused on medium-range forecasts, not their performance in cycling data assimilation (DA) systems. Cycling DA provides a statistically optimal estimate of model initial conditions, given observations and previous model forecasts. Here, real surface pressure observations are assimilated into several popular ML models using an ensemble Kalman filter, where accurate ensemble covariance estimation is essential to constrain unobserved state variables from sparse observations. In this cycling DA system, deterministic ML models accumulate small-scale noise until they diverge. Mitigating this noise with a spectral filter can stabilize the system, but with larger errors than traditional models. Perturbation experiments illustrate that these models do not accurately represent short-term error growth, leading to poor estimation of cross-variable covariances.</description>

      <title>LangYa: Revolutionizing Cross-Spatiotemporal Ocean Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs) as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors. Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training, and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.</description>

      <title>OMG-HD: A High-Resolution AI Weather Model for End-to-End Forecasts from Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence Weather Prediction (AIWP) models have achieved performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models by leveraging reanalysis data. However, a less-explored approach involves training AIWP models directly on observational data, enhancing computational efficiency and improving forecast accuracy by reducing the uncertainties introduced through data assimilation processes. In this study, we propose OMG-HD, a novel AI-based regional high-resolution weather forecasting model designed to make predictions directly from observational data sources, including surface stations, radar, and satellite, thereby removing the need for operational data assimilation. Our evaluation shows that OMG-HD outperforms both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s high-resolution operational forecasting system, IFS-HRES, and the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model at lead times of up to 12 hours across the contiguous United States (CONUS) region. We achieve up to a 13% improvement on RMSE for 2-meter temperature, 17% on 10-meter wind speed, 48% on 2-meter specific humidity, and 32% on surface pressure compared to HRRR. Our method shows that it is possible to use AI-driven approaches for rapid weather predictions without relying on NWP-derived weather fields as model input. This is a promising step towards using observational data directly to make operational forecasts with AIWP models.</description>

      <title>Unraveling how winds and surface heat fluxes control the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The North Atlantic Ocean circulation, fueled by winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, carries 1.25 PettaWatts of heat poleward in the subtropics, and helps in regulating global weather and climate patterns. Here, we assess the impacts of changes in winds and surface heat fluxes on the Atlantic Ocean circulation and heat transport using ocean simulations. We decompose the circulation and heat transport into warm and cold cells (resembling a subtropical gyre and the dense overturning circulation respectively), and a mixed cell capturing waters transitioning between warm and cold regions. Warm and mixed cells transport more heat poleward as wind stress increases; however, these anomalies are compensated by reductions in the cold cell's heat transport. Warm and cold cells transport more heat poleward when we increase meridional heat flux gradients. Our findings underscore the distinct roles of winds and surface heat fluxes in controlling the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport.</description>
