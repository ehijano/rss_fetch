      <title>Immersed Curves and 4-Manifold Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For 3-manifolds with torus boundary, the bordered Heegaard Floer invariants of Lipshitz--Ozsv\'ath--Thurston have a geometric interpretation as immersed multi-curves with local systems in the punctured torus according to the work of Hanselman--Rasmussen--Watson. We consider morphisms between these immersed curve invariants and show that they compute certain cobordism maps. More precisely, we relate composition in the Fukaya category of immersed curves in the punctured torus to composition of morphisms between the bordered Floer invariants, which have interpretations in terms of certain cobordism maps. We make use of this formalism to obstruct smooth equivalences between 4-manifolds with boundary, and between surfaces with boundary in the 4-ball.</description>

      <title>On reconstructing Morse-Bott functions with prescribed preimages on $3$-dimensional manifolds and conditions for the reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present conditions for reconstruction of Morse-Bott functions with prescribed preimages on $3$-dimensional manifolds. The present work strengthens a previous result for the Morse function case by the author and present a related example as another result. This shows a new result on reconstruction of nice smooth functions such that preimages are as prescribed. Such a study has been fundamental, natural, and surprisingly, founded recently, in 2006, by Sharko. Reconstruction of nice smooth functions on closed surfaces has been followed by Masumoto-Saeki, for example, and later, Gelbukh, Marzantowicz, Michalak, and so on, are studying Morse function cases further. The author has started explicit studies for $3$-dimensional cases respecting topologies of preimages of single points and obtained several results. We add another result on this.</description>

      <title>Periodic points of endperiodic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g\colon L\rightarrow L$ be an atoroidal, endperiodic map on an infinite type surface $L$ with no boundary and finitely many ends, each of which is accumulated by genus. By work of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor, $g$ is isotopic to a spun pseudo-Anosov map $f$. We show that spun pseudo-Anosov maps minimize the number of periodic points of period $n$ for sufficiently high $n$ over all maps in their homotopy class, strengthening a theorem of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor. We also show that the same theorem holds for atoroidal Handel--Miller maps when one only considers periodic points that lie in the intersection of the stable and unstable laminations. Furthermore, we show via example that spun-pseudo Anosov and Handel--Miller maps do not always minimize the number of periodic points of low period.</description>
