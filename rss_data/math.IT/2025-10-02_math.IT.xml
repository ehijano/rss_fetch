      <title>Directed Information $\gamma$-covering: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Context Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Directed Information $\gamma$-covering}, a simple but general framework for redundancy-aware context engineering. Directed information (DI), a causal analogue of mutual information, measures asymmetric predictiveness between chunks. If $\operatorname{DI}_{i \to j} \ge H(C_j) - \gamma$, then $C_i$ suffices to represent $C_j$ up to $\gamma$ bits. Building on this criterion, we formulate context selection as a $\gamma$-cover problem and propose a greedy algorithm with provable guarantees: it preserves query information within bounded slack, inherits $(1+\ln n)$ and $(1-1/e)$ approximations from submodular set cover, and enforces a diversity margin. Importantly, building the $\gamma$-cover is \emph{query-agnostic}: it incurs no online cost and can be computed once offline and amortized across all queries. Experiments on HotpotQA show that $\gamma$-covering consistently improves over BM25, a competitive baseline, and provides clear advantages in hard-decision regimes such as context compression and single-slot prompt selection. These results establish DI $\gamma$-covering as a principled, self-organizing backbone for modern LLM pipelines.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive cmWave/FR3 Channel Sounder for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an advanced channel sounding system designed for sensing and propagation experiments in all types of cellular deployment scenarios. The system's exceptional adaptability, high resolution, and sensitivity makes it an invaluable tool for utilization in a variety of indoor and outdoor measurement campaigns. The sounder has a 2.5 ns delay resolution, 170 dB path loss measurement capability and is able to measure a {360\textdegree} power-angular delay profile of the channel in less than 0.9 ms. Additionally, the system can be easily reconfigured to measure different frequency bands by changing the RF front-end antennas. This versatile sounder is suitable for double directional channel sounding, high-speed vehicular experiments such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, and integrated communication and sensing experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents comprehensive findings on the characterization of Indoor Hotspot channel parameters, derived from an extensive experimental campaign conducted at 6.9, 8.3, and 14.5 GHz in a commercial office building. Extensive measurements were carried out in diverse indoor office settings, including cubicles, conference rooms, hallways, and laboratory spaces across four floors. The path loss, shadow fading, delay spread, and angular spread was modeled. Our results offer significant insights into the attenuation and dispersion characteristics of wireless signals in diverse indoor settings in the centimeter-wave frequency band, and can be used for improving indoor network design and performance in commercial buildings.</description>

      <title>cmWave/FR3 Large-Scale Channel Characterization for Urban Macro/Micro and Suburban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the comprehensive characterization of large-scale channels at centimeter wave frequencies 7-15 GHz for urban macro/micro and suburban environments. Path-loss, large-scale fading, and angular channel statistics are presented. Urban environments exhibited higher path loss and delay spread due to dense obstacles, whereas suburban areas showed relatively lower path loss but significant variability due to fewer but larger obstructions. The findings provide valuable insights for network planners and engineers, aiding in the development of more efficient and adaptive communication strategies. Enhanced models for channel prediction and system design are proposed, contributing to the advancement of next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>OTFS for Joint Radar and Communication: Algorithms, Prototypes, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an Joint Radar and Communication (JRC) system that utilizes the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) signals. The system features a fast radar sensing algorithm for detecting target range and speed by using the OTFS communication signals, and a self-interference cancellation for enhanced multi-target separation. In addition to target detection, we propose methods for monitoring human vital signs, such as breathing rate and heartbeat. Furthermore, we explore two approaches for distinguishing between human and nonhuman targets: one based on signal processing and the other based on machine learning. We have developed a prototype JRC system using the software-defined radio (SDR) technology. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the prototype in detecting range, speed, and vital signs in both human and mobile robot scenarios, as well as in distinguishing between human and non-human targets.</description>

      <title>Layered Normalized Min-Sum Decoding with Bit Flipping for FDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair-density parity-check (FDPC) codes have been recently introduced demonstrating improved performance compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes standardized in 5G systems particularly in high-rate regimes. In this paper, we introduce a layered normalized min-sum (LNMS) message-passing decoding algorithm for the FDPC codes. We also introduce a syndrome-guided bit flipping (SGBF) method to enhance the error-correction performance of our proposed decoder. The LNMS decoder leverages conflict graph coloring for efficient layered scheduling, enabling faster convergence by grouping non-conflicting check nodes and updating variable nodes immediately after each layer. In the event of decoding failure, the SGBF method is activated, utilizing a novel reliability metric that combines log-likelihood ratio (LLR) magnitudes and syndrome-derived error counts to identify the least reliable bits. A set of candidate sequences is then generated by performing single-bit flips at these positions, with each candidate re-decoded via LNMS. The optimal candidate is selected based on the minimum syndrome weight. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed decoder. Numerical simulations on FDPC$(256,192)$ code with a bit-flipping set size of $T = 128$ and a maximum of $5$ iterations demonstrate that the proposed decoder achieves approximately a $0.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ coding gain over standalone LNMS decoding at a frame error rate (FER) of $10^{-3}$, while providing coding gains of $0.75-1.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ over other state-of-the-art codes including polar codes and 5G-LDPC codes at the same length and rate and also under belief propagation decoding.</description>

      <title>A universal compression theory: Lottery ticket hypothesis and superpolynomial scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When training large-scale models, the performance typically scales with the number of parameters and the dataset size according to a slow power law. A fundamental theoretical and practical question is whether comparable performance can be achieved with significantly smaller models and substantially less data. In this work, we provide a positive and constructive answer. We prove that a generic permutation-invariant function of $d$ objects can be asymptotically compressed into a function of $\operatorname{polylog} d$ objects with vanishing error. This theorem yields two key implications: (Ia) a large neural network can be compressed to polylogarithmic width while preserving its learning dynamics; (Ib) a large dataset can be compressed to polylogarithmic size while leaving the loss landscape of the corresponding model unchanged. (Ia) directly establishes a proof of the \textit{dynamical} lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that any ordinary network can be strongly compressed such that the learning dynamics and result remain unchanged. (Ib) shows that a neural scaling law of the form $L\sim d^{-\alpha}$ can be boosted to an arbitrarily fast power law decay, and ultimately to $\exp(-\alpha' \sqrt[m]{d})$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.</description>

      <title>Stable Phase Retrieval: Optimal Rates in Poisson and Heavy-tailed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate stable recovery guarantees for phase retrieval under two realistic and challenging noise models: the Poisson model and the heavy-tailed model. Our analysis covers both nonconvex least squares (NCVX-LS) and convex least squares (CVX-LS) estimators. For the Poisson model, we demonstrate that in the high-energy regime where the true signal $pmb{x}$ exceeds a certain energy threshold, both estimators achieve a signal-independent, minimax optimal error rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{n}{m}})$, with $n$ denoting the signal dimension and $m$ the number of sampling vectors. In contrast, in the low-energy regime, the NCVX-LS estimator attains an error rate of $\mathcal{O}(\|\pmb{x}\|^{1/4}_2\cdot(\frac{n}{m})^{1/4})$, which decreases as the energy of signal $\pmb{x}$ diminishes and remains nearly optimal with respect to the oversampling ratio. This demonstrates a signal-energy-adaptive behavior in the Poisson setting. For the heavy-tailed model with noise having a finite $q$-th moment ($q&gt;2$), both estimators attain the minimax optimal error rate $\mathcal{O}( \frac{\| \xi \|_{L_q}}{\| \pmb{x} \|_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n}{m}} )$ in the high-energy regime, while the NCVX-LS estimator further achieves the minimax optimal rate $\mathcal{O}( \sqrt{\|\xi \|_{L_q}}\cdot (\frac{n}{m})^{1/4} )$ in the low-energy regime. Our analysis builds on two key ideas: the use of multiplier inequalities to handle noise that may exhibit dependence on the sampling vectors, and a novel interpretation of Poisson noise as sub-exponential in the high-energy regime yet heavy-tailed in the low-energy regime. These insights form the foundation of a unified analytical framework, which we further apply to a range of related problems, including sparse phase retrieval, low-rank PSD matrix recovery, and random blind deconvolution.</description>

      <title>On Estimating the Quantum Tsallis Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative entropy between quantum states quantifies their distinguishability. The estimation of certain relative entropies has been investigated in the literature, e.g., the von Neumann relative entropy and sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the estimation of the quantum Tsallis relative entropy. We show that for any constant $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, the $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy between two quantum states of rank $r$ can be estimated with sample complexity $\operatorname{poly}(r)$, which can be made more efficient if we know their state-preparation circuits. As an application, we obtain an approach to tolerant quantum state certification with respect to the quantum Hellinger distance with sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(r^{3.5})$, which exponentially outperforms the folklore approach based on quantum state tomography when $r$ is polynomial in the number of qubits. In addition, we show that the quantum state distinguishability problems with respect to the quantum $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy and quantum Hellinger distance are $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete in a certain regime, and they are $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete in the low-rank case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data transmission in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) systems requires semantics-aware management that maximizes the delivery of timely and informative data. This paper investigates the optimization of the semantic metric Version Age of Information (VAoI) in a status update system comprising an energy-harvesting (EH) sensor and a destination monitoring node. We consider three levels of knowledge about the system model -- fully known, partially known, and unknown -- and propose corresponding optimization strategies: model-based, estimation-based, and model-free methods. By employing Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks, we analyze performance trade-offs under varying degrees of model information. Our findings provide guidance for designing efficient and adaptive semantics-aware policies in both known and unknown IoT environments.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Distributed Source Encryption using Mutual Information Security Criterion and the Strong Converse Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the general distributed secure source coding based on the common key cryptosystem proposed by Oohama and Santoso (ITW 2021). They proposed a framework of distributed source encryption and derived the necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission. However, the bounds of the rate region, which specifies both necessary and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission under the proposed cryptosystem, were derived based on a self-tailored non-standard} security criterion. In this paper we adopt the standard security criterion, i.e., standard mutual information. We successfully establish the bounds of the rate region based on this security criterion. Information spectrum method and a variant of Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem play an important role in deriving the result.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Base Station Assignment and Resource Allocation for 6G ISAC Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G networks, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) will be able to provide a performance boost in both perception and wireless connectivity. This paper considers a multiple base station (BS) architecture to support the comprehensive services of data transmission and multi-target sensing. In this context, a cooperative BS assignment and resource allocation (CBARA) strategy is proposed in this paper, aiming at jointly optimizing the communication and sensing (C&amp;S) performance. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound and the achievable rate with respect to transmit power and bandwidth are derived and utilized as optimization criteria for the CBARA scheme. We develop a heuristic alternating optimization algorithm to obtain an effective sub-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem caused by multiple coupled variables. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which achieves a performance improvement of 117% in communication rate and 40% in sensing accuracy, compared to the classic scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond the foundational significance, the problem of bounding nonlocal correlations by reasonable physical principles has meaningful practical consequences, particularly for device-independent (DI) cryptographic security. In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially post-quantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we have proven to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC. Additionally, we demonstrated that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum relative entropies on quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the renowned Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for directly estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Renyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most $2n+1$ with $n$ being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We prove that our loss function is operator-convex, ensuring that any local minimum is also a global minimum. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and observe the absence of the barren plateau phenomenon. As an application, we employ our algorithm to investigate the superadditivity of quantum channel capacity. Numerical simulations reveal new examples of qubit channels exhibiting strict superadditivity of coherent information, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning to address quantum-native problems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Mutual Information in High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence between two variables, yet accurate estimation from finite data remains notoriously difficult. No estimator is universally reliable, and common approaches fail in the high-dimensional, undersampled regimes typical of modern experiments. Recent machine learning-based estimators show promise, but their accuracy depends sensitively on dataset size, structure, and hyperparameters, with no accepted tests to detect failures. We close these gaps through a systematic evaluation of classical and neural MI estimators across standard benchmarks and new synthetic datasets tailored to challenging high-dimensional, undersampled regimes. We contribute: (i) a practical protocol for reliable MI estimation with explicit checks for statistical consistency; (ii) confidence intervals (error bars around estimates) that existing neural MI estimator do not provide; and (iii) a new class of probabilistic critics designed for high-dimensional, high-information settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol with computational experiments, showing that it consistently matches or surpasses existing methods while uniquely quantifying its own reliability. We show that reliable MI estimation is sometimes achievable even in severely undersampled, high-dimensional datasets, provided they admit accurate low-dimensional representations. This broadens the scope of applicability of neural MI estimators and clarifies when such estimators can be trusted.</description>

      <title>Extended c-differential distinguishers of full 9 and reduced-round Kuznyechik cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces {\em truncated inner $c$-differential cryptanalysis}, a novel technique that for the first time enables the practical application of $c$-differential uniformity to block ciphers. While Ellingsen et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2020) established the notion of $c$-differential uniformity using $(F(x\oplus a), cF(x))$, a key challenge remained: multiplication by $c$ disrupts the structural properties essential for block cipher analysis, particularly key addition.
  We resolve this challenge by developing an \emph{inner} $c$-differential approach where multiplication by $c$ affects the input: $(F(cx\oplus a), F(x))$. We prove that the inner $c$-differential uniformity of a function $F$ equals the outer $c$-differential uniformity of $F^{-1}$, establishing a fundamental duality. This modification preserves cipher structure while enabling practical cryptanalytic applications.
  Our main contribution is a comprehensive multi-faceted statistical-computational framework, implementing truncated $c$-differential analysis against the full 9-round Kuznyechik cipher with no key pre-whitening (the inner $c$-differentials are immune to the key whitening at the backend). Through extensive computational analysis involving millions of differential pairs, we demonstrate statistically significant non-randomness across all tested round counts. For the full 9-round cipher, we identify multiple configurations triggering critical security alerts, with bias ratios reaching $1.7\times$ and corrected p-values as low as $1.85 \times 10^{-3}$, suggesting insufficient security margin against this new attack vector. This represents the first practical distinguisher against a full 9-round Kuznyechik variant.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>
