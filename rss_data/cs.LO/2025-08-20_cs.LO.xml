      <title>Arithmetics within the Linear Time Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify fragments of the arithmetic $S_1$ that enjoy nice closure properties and have exact characterization of their definable multifunctions. To do this, in the language of $S_1$, $L_1$, starting from the formula classes, $\Sigma^{\mathsf b}_{i}$, which ignore sharply bounded quantifiers when determining quantifier alternations, we define new syntactic classes by counting bounded existential sharply bounded universal quantifiers blocks. Using these, we define arithmetics: $\breve{S}^{i}_{1}$, $TLS^i_1$ and $TSC^i_1$. $\breve{S}^{i}_{1}$ consists of open axioms for the language symbols and length induction for one of our new classes, $SIUT_{i,1}^{\{p(|id|)\}}$. $TLS^i_1$ and $TSC^i_1$ are defined using axioms related to dependent choice sequences for formulas from two other classes within $\Sigma^{\mathsf b}_{i}$. We prove for $i \geq 1$ that $$TLS^i_1 \subseteq TSC^i_1 \subseteq \breve{S}^{i}_{1} \preceq_{\forall B(SITT_{i+1}^{\{p(|id|)\}})} TLS^{i+1}_1$$ and that the $SITT_{i}^{\{p(|id|)\}}$-definable in $TLS^i_1$ (resp. $SITT_{i}^{\{2^{p(||id||)}\}}$-definable in $TSC^i_1$) multifunctions are $L_1$-$FLOGSPACE^{SIT_{i,1}}[wit]$ (resp. $L_1$-$FSC^{SIT_{i,1}}[wit]$). These multifunction classes are respectively the logspace or $SC$ (poly-time, polylog-space) computable multifunctions whose output is bound by a term in $L_1$ and that have access to a witness oracle for another restriction on the $\Sigma^{\mathsf b}_{i}$ formulas, $SIT_{i,1}$. For the $i=1$ cases, this simplifies respectively to the functions in logspace and $SC$, Steve's Class, poly-time, polylog-space. We prove independence results related to the Matiyasevich Robinson Davis Putnam Theorem (MRDP) and to whether our theories prove simultaneous nondeterministic polynomial time, sublinear space is equal to co-nondeterministic polynomial time, sublinear space.</description>

      <title>A Formalization of the Reversible Concurrent Calculus CCSKP in Beluga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reversible concurrent calculi are abstract models for concurrent systems in which any action can potentially be undone. Over the last few decades, different formalisms have been developed and their mathematical properties have been explored; however, none have been machine-checked within a proof assistant.  This paper presents the first Beluga formalization of the Calculus of Communicating Systems with Keys and Proof labels (CCSKP), a reversible extension of CCS.  Beyond the syntax and semantics of the calculus, the encoding covers state-of-the-art results regarding three relations over proof labels -- namely, dependence, independence and connectivity -- which offer new insights into the notions of causality and concurrency of events.  As is often the case with formalizations, our encoding introduces adjustments to the informal proof and makes explicit details which were previously only sketched, some of which reveal to be less straightforward than initially assumed.  We believe this work lays the foundations for future reversible concurrent calculi formalizations.</description>

      <title>Modular Multiparty Sessions with Mixed Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MultiParty Session Types (MPST) provide a useful framework for safe concurrent systems. Mixed choice (enabling a participant to play at the same time the roles of sender and receiver) increases the expressive power of MPST as well as the difficulty in controlling safety of communications. Such a control is more viable when modular systems are considered and the power of mixed choice fully exploited only inside loosely coupled modules. We carry over such idea in a type assignment approach to multiparty sessions. Typability for modular sessions entails Subject Reductions, Session Fidelity and Lock Freedom.</description>

      <title>On a Second-Order Version of Russellian Theory of Definite Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Definite descriptions are first-order expressions that denote unique objects. In this paper, we propose a second-order counterpart, designed to refer to unique relations between objects. We investigate this notion within the framework of Russell's theory of definite descriptions. While full second-order logic is incomplete, its fragment defined by Henkin's general models admits completeness. We develop our theory within this fragment and formalize it using a cut-free sequent calculus.</description>

      <title>Bisimilarity and Simulatability of Processes Parameterized by Join Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Departing from Larsen's concept of parameterized bisimilarity of processes with respect to interaction with environments, we start an exploration of its natural weakening: bisimilarity of unrestricted join interactions with environments. Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect to an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining -- respectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates processes p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction processes p &amp; e and q &amp; e of p and q with e are bisimilar. (Hereby join interactions r &amp; f facilitate a step with label a to r' &amp; f' if and only if r and f permit a-steps to r' and f' , respectively.) Join-interaction parameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized bisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser equivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from ji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions. We show that by adaptation to simulatability (simulation preorder) the same concept arises: parameterized simulatability coincides with ji-parameterized simulatability. For the discrimination preorder of (ji-)parameterized simulatability on environments we obtain the same result as Larsen did for parameterized bisimilarity. Also, we give a modal-logic characterization of (ji-)parameterized simulatability. Finally we gather open problems, and provide an outlook on our current related work.</description>

      <title>Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations (e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic. Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition. We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation (mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits of current LLMs for default reasoning.</description>

      <title>Quantifier Instantiations: To Mimic or To Revolt?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based, conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities, aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.</description>

      <title>On matrix rank function over bounded arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Mulmuley, 1987], Mulmuley gave an algorithm reducing the computation of the matrix rank function to that of determinants, of which the proof for the verification is elementary. In this article, we formalize this argument in the bounded arithmetic $LAP$; that is, we show that \[\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)\] for matrices $A,B$ with $mathbb{F}(X)$-coefficients implies \[rank(M)=dim(im M),\] where $\mathbb{F}$ is the universe of the field-sort of the theory, $M$ is a matrix with $\mathbb{F}$-coefficients, and $rank(M)$ is the rank function computed by Mulmuley's algorithm. Furthermore, interpreting $LAP$ by $VNC^{2}$ with $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Q}$ and using the result of [Tzameret \&amp; Cook, 2021], we see that $VNC^{2}$ can formalize $rank(M)$ and prove $rank(M)=dim(im M)$. Lastly, we give several examples of combinatorial statements provable in $VNC^{2}$, using the formalized linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Boolean Matrix Logic Programming on the GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional logic programming relies on symbolic computation on the CPU, which can limit performance for large-scale inference tasks. Recent advances in GPU hardware enable high-throughput matrix operations, motivating a shift toward parallel logic inference. Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) introduces a novel approach to datalog query evaluation using Boolean matrix algebra, well-suited to GPU acceleration. Building on this paradigm, we present two GPU-accelerated BMLP algorithms for bottom-up inference over linear dyadic recursive datalog programs. We further extend the BMLP theoretical framework to support general linear recursion with binary predicates. Empirical evaluations on reachability queries in large directed graphs and the Freebase 15K dataset show that our methods achieve 1-4 orders of magnitude speed up over state-of-the-art systems. These results demonstrate that Boolean matrix-based reasoning can significantly advance the scalability and efficiency of logic programming on modern hardware.
