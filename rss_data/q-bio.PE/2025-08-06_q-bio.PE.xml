      <title>Fitness and Overfitness: Implicit Regularization in Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an increase in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of complexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning, where complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal complexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a mathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal complexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical isomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between the replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types corresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to likelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization prevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity matches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over to the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity evolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too simple organisms suffering from \textit{overfitness} and \textit{underfitness}, respectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal additional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments decrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both evolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between over-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient flexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of optimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers new ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential causes for it to increase or decrease in different environments.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Helminth Transmission Dynamics under WASH Program Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and to assess the impact of community-based water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program interventions. STH infections are a pressing public health issue in vulnerable populations, impairing children's growth and development. Our model explicitly incorporates WASH coverage and effectiveness as dynamic parameters, enabling analysis of their effects on the basic and effective reproduction numbers and the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. Through saddle-node bifurcation analysis, we identify the critical thresholds in the intervention parameters necessary for infection elimination. Numerical simulations show these thresholds and delineate the conditions under which WASH interventions alone may or may not suffice to eliminate transmission, even under widespread coverage. Our findings provide a mathematical framework to optimize helminth control strategies and provide evidence-based insights for public health policies aligned with the World Health Organization's Global Strategy for the elimination of STH infections by 2030.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10766v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological evolution is realised through the same mechanisms of birth and death that underlie change in population density. The deep interdependence between ecology and evolution is well-established, and recent models focus on integrating eco-evolutionary dynamics to demonstrate how ecological and evolutionary processes interact and feed back upon each other. Nevertheless, a gap remains between the logical foundations of ecology and evolution. Population ecology and evolution have fundamental equations that define how the size of a population (ecology) and the average characteristic within a population (evolution) change over time. These fundamental equations are a complete and exact description of change for any closed population, but how they are formally linked remains unclear. We link the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolution with an equation that sums how individual characteristics interact with individual fitness in a population. From this equation, we derive the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolutionary biology (the Price equation). We thereby identify an overlooked bridge between ecology and biological evolution. Our unification formally recovers the equivalence between mean population growth rate and evolutionary fitness and links this change to ecosystem function. We outline how our framework can be used to further develop eco-evolutionary theory.</description>

      <title>Mathematical epidemiology of infectious diseases: an ongoing challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present an, admittedly somewhat subjective, bird's eye view of the mathematical theory concerning the spread of an infectious disease in a susceptible host population with static structure, culminating in a future-oriented description of various modelling challenges.</description>
