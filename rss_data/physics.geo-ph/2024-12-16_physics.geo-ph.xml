      <title>Analysis of stress in the cohesive zone, dissipation and fracture energy during shear rupture experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse high resolution slip rate data obtained during dynamic shear rupture experiments by Berman et al. (2020). We use an inverse method to extract the details of strength evolution within the cohesive zone. The overall behaviour is slip-weakening at high rupture speeds ($&gt;0.76C_\mathrm{R}$, where $C_\mathrm{R}$ is the Rayleigh wavespeed), but non-monotonic at low rupture speeds ($&lt;0.76C_\mathrm{R}$), with a transient increase after an initial strong weakening. The slower ruptures are associated to more weakening in the cohesive zone. The fraction of breakdown work associated to the initial weakening, immediately behind the rupture tip, matches the fracture energy estimated by independent methods, but the total breakdown work can be much larger than fracture energy. Complex stress evolution in the cohesive zone is compatible with a well-defined fracture energy that explains rupture tip propagation, but the complexity is reflected in local slip rates that will impact radiated waves.</description>

      <title>Rotating convection with a melting boundary: an application to the icy moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A better understanding of the ice-ocean couplings is required to better characterise the hydrosphere of the icy moons. Using global numerical simulations in spherical geometry, we have investigated here the interplay between rotating convection and a melting boundary. To do so, we have implemented and validated a phase field formulation in the open-source code \texttt{MagIC}. We have conducted a parameter study varying the influence of rotation, the vigour of the convective forcing and the melting temperature. We have evidenced different regimes akin to those already found in previous monophasic models in which the mean axisymmetric ice crust transits from pole-ward thinning to equator-ward thinning with the increase of the rotational constraint on the flow. The derivation of a perturbative model of heat conduction in the ice layer enabled us to relate those mean topographic changes to the underlying latitudinal heat flux variations at the top of the ocean. The phase change has also been found to yield the formation of sizeable non-axisymmetric topography at the solid-liquid interface with a typical size close to that of the convective columns. We have shown that the typical evolution timescale of the interface increases linearly with the crest-to-trough amplitude and quadratically with the mean melt radius. In the case of the largest topographic changes, the convective flows become quasi locked in the topography due to the constructive coupling between convection and ice melting. The tentative extrapolation to the planetary regimes yields $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$ meters for the amplitude of non-axisymmetric topography at the base of the ice layer of Enceladus and $\mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$ meters for Titan.</description>

      <title>Sims: An Interactive Tool for Geospatial Matching and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring, processing, and visualizing geospatial data requires significant computing resources, especially for large spatio-temporal domains. This challenge hinders the rapid discovery of predictive features, which is essential for advancing geospatial modeling. To address this, we developed Similarity Search (Sims), a no-code web tool that allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and perform similarity search over defined regions of interest using Google Earth Engine as a backend. Sims is designed to complement existing modeling tools by focusing on feature exploration rather than model creation. We demonstrate the utility of Sims through a case study analyzing simulated maize yield data in Rwanda, where we evaluate how different combinations of soil, weather, and agronomic features affect the clustering of yield response zones. Sims is open source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/Sims</description>
