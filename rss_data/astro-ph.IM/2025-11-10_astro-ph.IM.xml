      <title>SGNL: Scalable Low-Latency Gravitational Wave Detection Pipeline for Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SGNL, a scalable, low-latency gravitational-wave search pipeline. It reimplements the core matched-filtering principles of the GstLAL pipeline within a modernized framework. The Streaming Graph Navigator library, a lightweight Python streaming framework, replaces GstLAL's GStreamer infrastructure, simplifying pipeline construction and enabling flexible, modular graph design. The filtering core is reimplemented in PyTorch, allowing SGNL to leverage GPU acceleration for improved computational scalability. We describe the pipeline architecture and introduce a novel implementation of the Low-Latency Online Inspiral Detection algorithm in which components are pre-synchronized to reduce latency. Results from a 40-day Mock Data Challenge show that SGNL's event recovery and sensitivity are consistent with GstLAL's within statistical and systematic uncertainties. Notably, SGNL achieves a median latency of 5.4 seconds, a 42\% reduction compared to GstLAL's 9.3 seconds.</description>

      <title>Blind Strong Gravitational Lensing Inversion: Joint Inference of Source and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution (and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.</description>

      <title>Optimizing broadband microwave absorbers for applications in the 70-200 GHz range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of an extensive suite of numerical simulations that probe square-tiled microwave absorber performance as a function of material properties, frequency, geometry, and unit cell size. The work, which probes both specular reflection and total absorption, highlights the critical importance of the absorber scale size relative to the incidence wavelength while suggesting that material properties have a comparatively weaker impact on overall performance. We show that some absorber designs can achieve 99.5-99.9% frequency-averaged absorption across the 70 to 200 GHz range for normal incidence and that low specular reflectance does not necessarily guarantee optimal absorption performance. Our results indicate that exponential, Klopfenstein, and linear impedance tapers provide comparable performance as long as a unit cell size of 1 to 4 mm is chosen. Simulation results are validated against measurements of specular reflectance.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Nested Sampling Database for Bayesian Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology. While parameter estimation is achievable with unnormalised posteriors traditionally obtained via MCMC methods, comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification require Bayesian evidences and normalised posteriors, which remain computationally prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we present $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing DiRAC-funded (DP192 and 264) pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains with their normalised posterior samples, computed using $\texttt{Cobaya}$ and the Boltzmann solver $\texttt{CAMB}$. $\texttt{unimpeded}$ delivers systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models (including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions) and 39 modern cosmological datasets (comprising individual probes and their pairwise combinations). The built-in tension statistics calculator enables rapid computation of six tension quantification metrics. All chains are hosted on Zenodo with permanent access via the unimpeded API, analogous to the renowned Planck Legacy Archive but utilising nested sampling in addition to traditional MCMC methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the Vega flight computer, and its corresponding ground station developed by CATS, a company producing open-source flight computers and tracking systems tailored for student-made rockets. These flight computers, designed to support rockets reaching altitudes of up to 30 km and possibly higher, play a crucial role in advancing educational rocketry and facilitating hands-on learning experiences in aerospace engineering. As the official sponsor of the European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC), these flight computers have become integral to the competition, providing reliable and sophisticated telemetry and control capabilities that enhance both safety and performance. The paper delves into the technical specifications and educational impact of these systems, highlighting their contribution to the broader European rocketry programmes. Through comprehensive field data and case studies from the recent European Rocketry Challenge, this study underscores the potential of open-source flight computers to inspire the next generation of aerospace professionals.</description>

      <title>Micrometeoroid Impact Rate Analysis for an Artemis-Era Lunar Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Artemis Mission aims to return astronauts to the Moon and establish a base at the lunar south pole. A key challenge is understanding the threat from micrometeoroid impacts, which are too small to monitor directly. Using NASA's Meteoroid Engineering Model 3 (\texttt{MEM~3}), we estimate micrometeoroid impact rates on a base comparable in size to the International Space Station (100\,m $\times$ 100\,m $\times$ 10\,m). We find that a lunar base would experience $\sim$15,000--23,000 incident impacts per year by micrometeoroids with a mass range of $10^{-6}$--$10^{1}$~g, depending on location -- with minima at the lunar poles, a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude, and a factor of $\sim$1.6 variation between the two. To assess the mitigating effect of protection systems, we present a functional relationship describing the number of impacts that penetrate the shielding as a function of the minimum meteoroid mass capable of penetrating the shield -- the ``critical mass.'' We estimate that state-of-the-art Whipple shields protect against $\sim$99.9997\% of micrometeoroids. By re-running \texttt{MEM~3} with a minimum mass equal to the critical mass of modern Whipple shields, we determine that a shielded lunar base would experience $\sim$0.024--0.037 penetrating impacts per year -- again with minima at the poles and a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude. These results indicate that (1) the lunar poles are optimal for sustained habitation, (2) gravitational focusing by Earth dominates over its geometric shielding for this micrometeoroid flux, and (3) current shielding technology can reduce micrometeoroid threats by nearly five orders of magnitude, making long-duration lunar habitation feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope has enabled detailed studies of high-energy astrophysical sources. To support analysis, we present FermiPhased, a flexible, open-source tool for phase-resolved studies of pulsars, binaries, and other periodically variable sources. Built on the Fermipy framework, FermiPhased offers three modes: standard, adaptive (fixed counts), and joint phase-resolved analysis, enabling users to flexibly bin data based on phase, count statistics, or jointly fit different epochs of interest. FermiPhased is optimized for parallel execution and use on computing clusters. It enables parallelized extraction of phase-resolved fluxes, spectra, and intermediary data products, with tutorials and documentation available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Detecting FRB by DANCE: a method based on DEnsity ANalysis and Cluster Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient signals exhibiting diverse strengths and emission bandwidths. Traditional single-pulse search techniques are widely employed for FRB detection; yet weak, narrow-band bursts often remain undetectable due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in integrated profiles. We developed DANCE, a detection tool based on cluster analysis of the original spectrum. It is specifically designed to detect and isolate weak, narrow-band FRBs, providing direct visual identification of their emission properties. This method performs density clustering on reconstructed, RFI-cleaned observational data, enabling the extraction of targeted clusters in time-frequency domain that correspond to the genuine FRB emission range. Our simulations show that DANCE successfully extracts all true signals with SNR~&gt;5 and achieves a detection precision exceeding 93%. Furthermore, through the practical detection of FRB 20201124A, DANCE has demonstrated a significant advantage in finding previously undetectable weak bursts, particularly those with distinct narrow-band features or occurring in proximity to stronger bursts.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on atmospheric abundances of KELT-11b and WASP-69b from a retrieval approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WASP-69b and KELT-11b are two low-density hot Jupiters, which are expected to show strong atmospheric features in their transmission spectra. Such features offer valuable insights into the chemical composition, thermal structure, and cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. High-resolution spectroscopic observations can be used to study the line-forming regions in exoplanet atmospheres and potentially detect signals despite the presence of clouds. We aimed to detect various molecular species and constrain the chemical abundances and cloud deck pressures using high-resolution spectroscopy. We observed multiple transits of these planets with CARMENES and applied the cross-correlation method to detect atmospheric signatures. Further, we used an injection-recovery approach and retrievals to place constraints on the atmospheric properties. We detected a tentative H$_2$O signal for KELT-11b but not for WASP-69b, and searches for other molecules such as H$_2$S and CH$_4$ resulted in non-detections for both planets. By investigating the signal strength of injected synthetic models, we constrained which atmospheric abundances and cloud deck pressures are consistent with our cross-correlation results. In addition, we show that a retrieval-based approach leads to similar constraints of these parameters.</description>

      <title>High-spectral Resolution, Multi-wavelength Center-to-limb Observations of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center-to-limb variations (CLVs) of photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines were obtained in 2025 July and August using drift scans from the echelle spectrograph of the 0.7 m Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (ODT) in Tenerife, Spain. This instrument can observe four spectral regions simultaneously, enabling multi-line spectroscopy with high spectral resolution of various activity features and the quiet Sun in the lower solar atmosphere. The initial results of Halpha observations demonstrate the diagnostic potential of drift scans obtained with a ground-based, high-resolution telescope. Data products include spectroheliograms and maps of physical parameters such as line-of-sight velocity, line width, and line-core intensity. The combination of the CLV from photospheric and chromospheric lines, as well as the wide range of formation heights of the selected lines, renders this dataset ideal for characterizing stellar and exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>EMPEROR I. Exoplanet MCMC parallel tempering for RV orbit retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{EMPEROR}, an open-source Python framework designed for efficient exoplanet detection and characterisation with radial velocities (RV). \texttt{EMPEROR} integrates Dynamic Nested Sampling (DNS) and Adaptive Parallel Tempering (APT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), supporting multiple noise models such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Moving Averages (MA). The framework enables systematic model comparison using statistical metrics, including Bayesian evidence ($\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while providing automated, publish-ready visualisations. \texttt{EMPEROR} is evaluated across three distinct systems to assess its capabilities in different detection scenarios. Sampling performance, model selection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51 Pegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard's Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an effective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter parameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation $P_{\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle $P_{\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the sensitivity of $\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard's star, several noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are successfully retrieved with all of them. The best model shows a period of 3.1536$\pm$0.0003~d, minimum mass of 0.38$\pm$0.03 M$_{\rm{\oplus}}$, and semi-major axis of 0.02315$\pm$0.00039~AU. Purely statistical inference might be insufficient on its own for robust exoplanet detection. Effective methodologies must integrate domain knowledge, heuristic criteria, and multi-faceted model comparisons. The versatility of \texttt{EMPEROR} in handling diverse noise structures, its systematic model selection, and its improved performance make it a valuable tool for RV exoplanetary studies.</description>

      <title>On the calculation of p-values for quadratic statistics in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) projects have reported various lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in their data. One key line of evidence involves a detection statistic sensitive to inter-pulsar correlations, such as those induced by GWs. A $p$-value is then calculated to assess how unlikely it is for the observed signal to arise under the null hypothesis $H_0$, purely by chance. However, PTAs cannot empirically draw samples from $H_0$. As a workaround, various techniques are used in the literature to approximate $p$-values under $H_0$. One such technique, which has been heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of "scrambling" transformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby simulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the detection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value methodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a specific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate $p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many analytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that scrambling methods are not model-independent and thus not completely empirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are advocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value approach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived to evaluate the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on real data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been calculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.</description>

Abstract: The POLAR-2 mission consists of 3 instruments designed with the combined aim of producing a deeper understanding of Gamma-Ray Bursts. To achieve this, POLAR-2 relies on polarisation measurements and, for the first time will provide these using 2 separate polarimeter detectors. The first of these is a payload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000 keV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The development of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned from the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design. In addition, its development included detailed characterization, space qualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large number of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design. We will present these along with an overview of the readout electronics. These electronics were developed with flexibility in mind, as well as low cost and low power consumption. As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is also used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read out an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a coded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and localization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use gas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy region. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these for wide field of view observations. The combination of the three instruments will allow to perform detailed spectral, localization and polarization measurements of these transient phenomena together for the first time. Here we provide an overview of the technologies employed in the mission along with detailed predictions on its capabilities after its launch currently foreseen in 2027.</description>

      <title>AppleCiDEr II: SpectraNet -- A Deep Learning Network for Spectroscopic Data</title>

Abstract: Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.</description>

      <title>Detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background with the space-borne gravitational-wave detector network</title>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is one of the main detection targets for future millihertz space-borne gravitational-wave observatories such as the \ac{LISA}, TianQin, and Taiji. For a single LISA-like detector, a null-channel method was developed to identify the SGWB by integrating data from the A and E channels with a noise-only T channel. However, the noise monitoring channel will not be available if one of the laser interferometer arms fails. By combining these detectors, it will be possible to build detector networks to search for SGWB via cross-correlation analysis.In this work, we developed a Bayesian data analysis method based on \ac{TDI} Michelson-type channel. We then investigate the detectability of the TianQin-LISA detector network for various isotropic SGWB. Assuming a three-month observation, the TianQin-LISA detector network could be able to confidently detect SGWB with energy density as low as $\Omega_{\rm PL} = 6.0 \times 10^{-13}$, $\Omega_{\rm Flat} = 2.0 \times 10^{-12}$ and $\Omega_{\rm SP} = 1.2 \times 10^{-12}$ for power-law, flat and single-peak models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Background stability and annual modulation test using PICOLON ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detector</title>

Abstract: The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85 purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by the PICOLON experiment.</description>

      <title>Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (&lt;100 days) experience X-ray and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets' upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency, multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster, and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g., 13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b, $R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation. However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be &gt;&gt;$R_P$, making it necessary to use $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at 1.25 km grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of 8192 GPUs on Alps and 20480 GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>
