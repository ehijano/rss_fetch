      <title>Precision measurement of the $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ $^3D_1$ microwave clock transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report precision measurement of the unperturbed ${^{3}}D_1$ microwave transition frequencies in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ to a fractional uncertainty of $4\times10^{-14}$. We find the $|F,m_F\rangle=|8,0\rangle$ to $|7,0\rangle$ hyperfine transition frequency to be $10\,491\,519\,945.228\,82(38)\,$Hz and the $|7,0\rangle$ to $|6,0\rangle$ transition frequency to be $11\,290\,004\,289.881\,61(36)\,$ Hz. At this precision we are able to observe the hyperfine-mediated effects in the ratio of the quadrupole shifts, from which we can directly infer the residual quadrupole moment after $^3D_1$ hyperfine averaging. We find a residual quadrupole moment of ${-2.48(23)\times10^{-4}}\,e a_0^2$, consistent with a previous assessment using a different and less direct method. With the unperturbed microwave frequencies accurately known, the residual quadrupole shift for a $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ ($^3D_1$) optical frequency standard can henceforth be readily evaluated to $&lt;10^{-20}$ uncertainty by routine ${^{3}}{D}_1$ microwave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A laser with instability reaching $4 \times 10^{-17}$ based on a 10-cm-long silicon cavity at sub-5-K temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06636</link>

Abstract: The realization of ultra-stable lasers with $10^{-17}$-level frequency stability has enabled a wide range of researches on precision metrology and fundamental science, where cryogenic single-crystalline cavities constitute the heart of such ultra-stable lasers. For further improvements in stability, increasing the cavity length at few-kelvin temperatures provides a promising alternative to utilizing relatively short cavities with novel coating, but has yet to be demonstrated with state-of-the-art stability. Here we report on the realization of a relatively long ultra-stable silicon cavity with a length of 10 cm and sub-5-K operating temperatures. We devise a dynamical protocol of cool-quiet quench measurement that reveals the inherent $10^{-17}$-level frequency instability of the silicon cavity despite the substantially larger frequency noise induced by the cryostat vibration. We further develop a method for suppressing the cryostat-vibration-induced frequency noise under continuous cooling, and observe an average frequency instability of $4.3(2) \times 10^{-17}$ for averaging times of 4 to 12 seconds. Using the measured noise power spectral density, we compute a median linewidth of 9.6(3) mHz for the silicon cavity laser at 1397 nm, which is supported by an empirically determined linewidth of 5.7(3) mHz based on direct optical beat measurements. These results establish a new record for optical cavities within a closed-cycle cryocooler at sub-5-K temperatures and provide a prototypical system for using long cryogenic cavities to enhance frequency stabilities to the low-$10^{-17}$ or better level.</description>

      <title>Observation of multiple time crystals in a driven-dissipative system with Rydberg gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals, and high-harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</description>

      <title>Role of plasma waves in rescattering processes in intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rescattering of the photoelectron at its parent ion underlie a number of phenomena in intense laser field interaction with matter, such as high harmonic generation, attosecond pulse production, non-sequential double ionization, and others. These processes are unavoidably accompanied by the medium photoionization. The interaction of the laser pulse with the photoionization-induced plasma excites wakefield waves, which are self-consistently coupled plasma density and Langmuir waves. We study theoretically the effect of the electric field of the plasma wave on the rescattering processes. We show that this field can compensate for the magnetic drift of the rescattering electron, which otherwise dramatically suppresses the rescattering efficiency in intense low-frequency laser fields. Moreover, the presence of the plasma wave field leads to new lines in the spectrum emitted due to the XUV free-induction decay (XFID). Observation of these lines can allow, in particular, the detection of forbidden transition frequencies, thus providing new perspectives for XFID spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a photonic time-frequency Fourier transform and temporal double slit using atomic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum memory for light is expected to play a crucial role in quantum communication protocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</description>
