      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition and Thermal Equilibrium in the Lattice Thirring Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases, and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as non-analyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Whereas the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>DMRG study of the theta-dependent mass spectrum in the 2-flavor Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependent mass spectrum of the massive $2$-flavor Schwinger model in the Hamiltonian formalism using the density-matrix renormalization group(DMRG). The masses of the composite particles, the pion and sigma meson, are computed by two independent methods. One is the improved one-point-function scheme, where we measure the local meson operator coupled to the boundary state and extract the mass from its exponential decay. Since the $\theta$ term causes a nontrivial operator mixing, we unravel it by diagonalizing the correlation matrix to define the meson operator. The other is the dispersion-relation scheme, a heuristic approach specific to Hamiltonian formalism. We obtain the dispersion relation directly by measuring the energy and momentum of the excited states. The sign problem is circumvented in these methods, and their results agree with each other even for large $\theta$. We reveal that the $\theta$-dependence of the pion mass at $m/g=0.1$ is consistent with the prediction by the bosonized model. We also find that the mass of the sigma meson satisfies the semi-classical formula, $M_{\sigma}/M_{\pi}=\sqrt{3}$, for almost all region of $\theta$. While the sigma meson is a stable particle thanks to this relation, the eta meson is no longer protected by the $G$-parity and becomes unstable for $\theta\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>New physical processes for extracting GPDs with a better sensitivity to partonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of exclusive processes for a better study of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), which we refer to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEPs). We advocate a two-stage framework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a clear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the sensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of GPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be readily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a photon beam, respectively. Both processes are capable of providing enhanced sensitivity to the $x$-dependence, overcoming the problem of shadow GPDs, and disentangling different types of GPDs with various spin asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the isospin eigenstate $\bar D \Sigma_c$, $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$, and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks by their electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the $\mathrm{P_{c}(4312)}$, $\mathrm{P_{c}(4380)}$, and $\mathrm{P_{c}(4440)}$ pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}$, $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, and $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2 $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>

      <title>Contact interaction study of proton parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) and treating the proton as a quark + interacting-diquark bound state, whose structure is obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, we provide a comprehensive, coherent set of predictions for unpolarised and polarised proton parton distribution functions (DFs): valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea. The results enable many themes to be addressed, including: the asymmetry of antimatter in the proton; the neutron:proton structure function ratio; helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the charm quark momentum fraction; the sign and size of the polarised gluon DF; and the origin of the proton spin. In all cases where sound analyses of data are available, SCI predictions are semiquantitatively in agreement with the results. Those mismatches which exist are typically attributable to the momentum-independence of the underlying interaction. Judiciously interpreted, the SCI delivers a sound and insightful explanation of proton structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Investigation of full-charm and full-bottom pentaquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous advancement of experimental techniques and investigations has led to observations of various exotic states in particle physics. Each addition to this family of states not only raises expectations for future discoveries but also focuses attention on such potential new states. Building upon this motivation and inspired by recent observations of various traditional and exotic particles containing an increased number of heavy quarks, our study provides a spectroscopic search for potential pentaquark states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^-$ and composed entirely of charm or bottom quarks. We predict the masses for full-charm and full-bottom pentaquark states as $m = 7628 \pm 112$~MeV and $m = 21982 \pm 144$~MeV, respectively. We also compute the current couplings of these states to vacuum, which are main inputs in investigations of their various possible decays.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation in fermionic thermal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>
