      <title>Gene Regulatory Network Inference in the Presence of Dropouts: a Causal View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) is a challenging problem, particularly owing to the presence of zeros in single-cell RNA sequencing data: some are biological zeros representing no gene expression, while some others are technical zeros arising from the sequencing procedure (aka dropouts), which may bias GRNI by distorting the joint distribution of the measured gene expressions. Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original data without dropouts. This particular test-wise deletion procedure, in which we perform CI tests on the samples without zeros for the conditioned variables, can be seamlessly integrated with existing structure learning approaches including constraint-based and greedy score-based methods, thus giving rise to a principled framework for GRNI in the presence of dropouts. We further show that the causal dropout model can be validated from data, and many existing statistical models to handle dropouts fit into our model as specific parametric instances. Empirical evaluation on synthetic, curated, and real-world experimental transcriptomic data comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Semi-Quantitative Analysis and Seroepidemiological Evidence of Past Dengue Virus Infection among HIV-infected patients in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its endemic nature as well as the recent outbreaks, information on the opportunistic DENV in Anambra state has been sparse. This study thus aimed to give seroepidemiological evidence of past dengue virus infection among HIV-infected patients in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria. Plasma from 94 HIV-infected patients who were attending Saint Charles Borromeo Hospital, Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria was tested for IgG antibodies specific to the dengue virus by IgG ELISA assay. The prevalence of past dengue virus infection was 61.7% (n = 58/94). This study showed age group 0-15 years (77.30%), female gender (65.1%), married (63.9%) and no formal level (100.0 %) as the highest seropositivity among the study participants. In terms of immunological and virological markers, greater IgG seroprevalence was observed in individuals with a viral load of &lt;40 copies/ml (64.0%) and a CD4 count of &gt;350 cells/ul (63.2%). The high IgG seropositivity of Dengue Virus (DENV) among HIV-infected individuals on Onitsha is cause for concern.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Training of Score-Conditioned Generator for Offline Design of Biological Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing biological sequences, e.g., proteins, DNA, and RNA, to maximize a black-box score function that is only evaluated in an offline dataset. We propose a novel solution, bootstrapped training of score-conditioned generator (BootGen) algorithm. Our algorithm repeats a two-stage process. In the first stage, our algorithm trains the biological sequence generator with rank-based weights to enhance the accuracy of sequence generation based on high scores. The subsequent stage involves bootstrapping, which augments the training dataset with self-generated data labeled by a proxy score function. Our key idea is to align the score-based generation with a proxy score function, which distills the knowledge of the proxy score function to the generator. After training, we aggregate samples from multiple bootstrapped generators and proxies to produce a diverse design. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms competitive baselines on biological sequential design tasks.

      <title>Density Estimation via Measure Transport: Outlook for Applications in the Biological Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One among several advantages of measure transport methods is that they allow for a unified framework for processing and analysis of data distributed according to a wide class of probability measures. Within this context, we present results from computational studies aimed at assessing the potential of measure transport techniques, specifically, the use of triangular transport maps, as part of a workflow intended to support research in the biological sciences. Scenarios characterized by the availability of limited amount of sample data, which are common in domains such as radiation biology, are of particular interest. We find that when estimating a distribution density function given limited amount of sample data, adaptive transport maps are advantageous. In particular, statistics gathered from computing series of adaptive transport maps, trained on a series of randomly chosen subsets of the set of available data samples, leads to uncovering information hidden in the data. As a result, in the radiation biology application considered here, this approach provides a tool for generating hypotheses about gene relationships and their dynamics under radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Volumetric Study for the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease from Structural MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of individuals today. The prognosis of the disease solely depends on treating symptoms as they arise and proper caregiving, as there are no current medical preventative treatments apart from newly developing drugs which can, at most, slow the progression. Thus, early detection of the disease at its most premature state is of paramount importance. This work aims to survey imaging biomarkers corresponding to the progression of AD and also reviews some of the existing feature extraction methods. A longitudinal study of structural MR images was performed for given temporal test subjects with AD selected randomly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. A pipeline was implemented to study the data, including modern pre-processing techniques such as spatial image registration, skull stripping, inhomogeneity correction and tissue segmentation using an unsupervised learning approach using intensity histogram information. The temporal data across multiple visits is used to study the structural change in volumes of these tissue classes, namely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM) as the patients progressed further into the disease. To detect changes in volume trends, we also analyse the data with a modified Mann-Kendall statistic. The segmented features thus extracted and the subsequent trend analysis provide insights such as atrophy, increase or intolerable shifting of GM, WM and CSF and should help in future research for automated analysis of Alzheimer's detection with clinical domain explainability.</description>
