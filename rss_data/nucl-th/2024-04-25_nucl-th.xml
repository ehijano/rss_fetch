      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors for Nucleons in Short-Range Correlations and the EMC effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between medium modifications of nucleon electromagnetic form factors and nucleon structure functions is examined using a model motivated by Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD). These modifications are closely connected with the influence of short-ranged correlations. The size of the modifications to nucleon form factors is shown to be about the same as the modifications to the structure functions. Thus, small limits on form factors modifications do not rule out an explanation of the EMC effect motivated by the influence of short range correlations, as claimed by a recent paper.</description>

      <title>Nuclear incompressibility and its enduring impact on fusion cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion mechanism of reactions involving even-even $^{112-124}$Sn, doubly magic $^{132}$Sn, $^{208}$Pb as targets, and $^{64}$Ni as the projectile is explored within the relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism. The main aim of choosing these nuclei is to explore the correlation between the nuclear incompressibility and the fusion cross-section. The nucleus-nucleus interaction potential is calculated by folding the axially deformed nuclear densities and the relativistic R3Y nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential obtained for the nonlinear sets of NL3$^*$, hybrid, and NL1, which yield different values for various characteristics of nuclear matter at saturation. The fusion barrier characteristics obtained for different RMF parameterizations are further used to calculate the cross-section within the $\ell$-summed Wong model. We found a decrease in the barrier height and consequently, an increase in the cross-section with a decrease in the incompressibility for all sets of parameters considered. The calculated cross section is satisfactorily consistent with the available experimental data for $^{64}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb system. In contrast, the nuclear potentials obtained for NL3$^*$ and the hybrid parameter sets underestimate the cross-section at below-barrier energies for $^{64}$Ni+$^{112-124,132}$Sn reactions. This discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{112-124,132}$Sn reactions can be correlated with the soft behaviour of the Sn isotopes. The compressible nature of Sn-isotopes is inferred to lower the barrier height, which further leads to enhancement of the experimental fusion and/or capture cross-section at below-barrier energies. Thus, the NL1 parameter set with a comparatively soft equation of state (EoS) is observed to be a better choice to describe the sub-barrier nuclear fusion dynamics of reactions involving the Sn-isotopes.</description>

      <title>The Coupling Constant of the Pseudovector Pion-nucleon Interaction for the Magnetic Moment of Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the suppression of the coupling constant in the pseudovector pion-nucleon interaction is examined to account for the calculation of the magnetic moment of nucleon. Among three kinds of the higher-order corrections the vacuum polarization of the pion propagator contributes to the numerical value considerably. On the other hand the lowest-order vertex correction for the pion-nucleon-nucleon vertex does not give large effect in the approximation of the on-shell momenta for nucleons.</description>

      <title>Primordial Nucleosynthesis with Non-Extensive Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional Big Bang model successfully anticipates the initial abundances of 2H(D), 3He, and 4He, aligning remarkably well with observational data. However, a persistent challenge arises in the case of 7Li, where the predicted abundance exceeds observations by a factor of approximately three. Despite numerous efforts employing traditional nuclear physics to address this incongruity over the years, the enigma surrounding the lithium anomaly endures. In this context, we embark on an exploration of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) of light element abundances with the application of Tsallis non-extensive statistics. A comparison is made between the outcomes obtained by varying the non-extensive parameter q away from its unity value and both observational data and abundance predictions derived from the conventional big bang model. A good agreement is found for the abundances of 4He, 3He and 7Li, implying that the lithium abundance puzzle might be due to a subtle fine-tuning of the physics ingredients used to determine the BBN. However, the deuterium abundance deviates from observations.</description>

      <title>Hadronic effects on $\Lambda$ polarization in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ hyperon spin flip and non-flip cross sections are calculated in a simple hadronic model by including both the $s$-channel process involving the spin 3/2, positive parity $\Sigma^*(1358)$ resonance and the $t$-channel process via the exchange of a scalar $\sigma$ meson. Although the $t$-channel process gives a thermally averaged cross section that is about a factor of 1.3 larger than that from the $s$-channel process, the $\Lambda$ spin flip to non-flip cross sections is negligibly small in the $t$-channel compared to the constant value of 1/3.5 in the $s$-channel process. With these cross sections included in a schematic kinetic model, the effects of hadronic scatterings on the $\Lambda$ spin polarization in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=7.7$ GeV are studied. It is found that the $\Lambda$ spin polarization only decreases by about 7\% during the hadronic stage of these collisions, which thus justifies the assumption in theoretical studies that compare the $\Lambda$ polarization calculated at the chemical freeze out to the measured one at the kinetic freeze out.</description>

      <title>Calculations of bound-state $\beta^-$-decay half-lives of highly ionized $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$, $^{187}$Re$^{75+}$ and $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method to calculate the bound-state $\beta$-decay half-lives of highly-ionized atoms, which is based on the combination of the Takahashi-Yokoi model and our recently-developed projected shell model that can take into account both allowed and first-forbidden transitions of nuclear $\beta$ decay. Three examples that are of much experimental interests, $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$, $^{187}$Re$^{75+}$ and $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$ are taken for calculations. The ground and low-lying states of related nuclei are described reasonably. The bound-state $\beta$-decay half-lives of $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$ and $^{187}$Re$^{75+}$ are described within a factor of two and four by our calculations without and with the quenching factors in allowed and first-forbidden transitions. The bound-state $\beta$-decay half-life of the last $s$-process branching point $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$ is predicted to be 58 and 305 days for cases without and with the quenching factors in calculations. The presented method provides a theoretical way to calculate systematically the bound-state $\beta$-decay half-lives of nuclei from light to heavy ones including odd-mass and even-mass cases for the first time.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole strength in $^{58}$Ni from forward-angle inelastic proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is a state-by-state analysis of possible E1 and M1 transitions in $^{58}$Ni with a high-resolution (p,p') experiment at 295 MeV and very forward angles including 0{\deg} and a comparison to results from studies of the dipole strength with the $(\gamma,\gamma')$ and (e,e') reactions. The E1 and M1 cross sections of individual peaks in the spectra are deduced with a multipole decomposition analysis and converted to reduced E1 and spin-M1 transition strengths using the virtual photon and the unit cross-section method, respectively. Despite the high level density good agreement is obtained for the deduced excitation energies of J = 1 states in the three types of experiments indicating that the same states are excited. The B(E1) and B(M1) strengths from the $(\gamma,\gamma^\prime)$ experiments are systematically smaller than in the present work because of the lack of information on branching ratios to lower-lying excited states and the competition of particle emission. Fair agreement with the B(M1) strengths extracted from the (e,e') data is obtained after removal of E1 transitions uniquely assigned in the present work, which belong to a low-energy toroidal mode with unusual properties mimicking M1 excitations in electron scattering. The experimental M1 strength distribution is compared to large-scale shell-model calculations with the effective GXPF1A and KB3G interactions. They provide a good description of the isospin splitting and the running sum of the M1 strength. A quenching factor 0.74 for the spin-isospin part of the M1 operator is needed to attain quantitative agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in particle physics: from nuclear isospin to the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concise pedagogic introduction to group representation theory motivated by the historical developments surrounding the advent of the Eightfold Way. Abstract definitions of groups and representations are avoided in favour of the physical intuition of symmetries of the nuclear interaction. The concept of nuclear isospin is used as a physical motivation to introduce SU(2) and discuss the main techniques of representation theory. The discovery of strange particles motivates extending the symmetry group to SU(3), at first in the context of the Sakata model. We highlight the successes in fitting mesons in the SU(3) octet, discuss the drawbacks of the Sakata model for baryonic classifications, and how the Eightfold Way finally led to the quark model. This approach has two major advantages: (i) the main concepts of the theory of Lie groups are introduced and discussed without ever losing touch with its applications in particle physics; (ii) it allows the beginner to study group theory while also becoming acquainted with the historical developments of particle physics that led to the concept of quarks. In particular, in this pedagogical path the quarks appear as yet another class of particles predicted from symmetry principles, rather than being introduced ad hoc for postulating an SU(3) symmetry, as usually done in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian study of quark models in view of recent astrophysical constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comparative analysis between the density-dependent quark model and the vector MIT bag model using Bayesian analysis. We use the equations of state generated by these two models to describe quark stars. We impose four recent observational astrophysical constraints on both models to determine their model-dependent parameters in an optimized manner assuming that the compact objects observed are composed entirely of self-bound quarks. The restrictions are aimed at producing stars with maximum masses $2 - 2.35$ M$_\odot$ and a mass-radii diagram compatible with the observed pulsars: PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, PSR J0030+0451 and the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518. With this analysis, the parameter dependence of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) of both models is restricted.</description>

      <title>Correlation of the hyperon potential stiffness with hyperon constituents in neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breaking of SU(6) symmetry to a more general flavor SU(3) symmetry could serve as a potential explanation for the "hyperon puzzle" of neutron stars by adjusting the hyperon potentials. Specifically, when the soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) $\Lambda$ hyperon potentials fall within the domains of chiral SU(3) interactions NLO13 with two-body forces, the maximum mass of neutron stars is expected to be lower than 2.0 $M_\odot$, whereas it can exceed $2.0M_\odot$ if the RMF $\Lambda$ hyperon potentials are sufficiently stiff to be consistent with those from chiral SU(3) interactions NLO13 with three-body forces. In our investigation involving these two types of $\Lambda$ hyperon potentials, we explore how the hyperon yields and flows are affected in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the inclusion of hyperon potentials results in better agreement of the $\Lambda$ directed flows with data but without clear differentiation in the stiffness of the hyperon potentials. Similarly negligent is the disparity in the rapidity distributions of the $\Lambda$ collective flows predicted by the stiff and soft hyperon potentials. In contrast, the $\Lambda$ collective flows beyond the central rapidity region turn out to be sensitive to the stiffness of the RMF equation of state (EOS) with the preference of a soft RMF EOS to a stiff one. Notably, the transverse momentum distributions of $\Lambda$ hyperon production are sensitive to both the stiffness of the RMF EOS and $\Lambda$ hyperon potential at high transverse momenta.</description>

      <title>Mass suppression effect in QCD radiation and hadron angular distribution in jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite mass of the heavy quark suppresses the collimated radiations, which is generally referred to as the dead cone effect. In this paper, we study the distribution of hadron multiplicity over the hadron opening angle with respect to the jet axis in various flavors of jets. The corresponding measurement can be the most straightforward and simplest to explore the dynamical evolution of the radiations in the corresponding jet, which can expose the mass effect. We also propose the transverse energy-weighted angular distribution which sheds light on the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects in the radiation. With Monte-Carlo simulations, our calculation shows that the dead cone effect can be clearly seen by taking the ratio between the b jet and the light-quark (inclusive) jet, promising to be measured at the LHC in the future.</description>

Abstract: We derive the modified L\"uscher equation in the presence of the long-range force caused by the exchange of a light particle. It is shown that the use of this equation enables one to circumvent the problems related to the strong partial-wave mixing and the t-channel sub-threshold singularities. It is also demonstrated that the present method is intrinsically linked to the so-called modified effective-range expansion (MERE) in the infinite volume. A detailed comparison with the two recently proposed alternative approaches is provided.</description>

      <title>Charge-conjugation asymmetry and molecular content: the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the modifications that a dense nuclear medium induces in the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)^\pm$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^\pm$. In the vacuum, we consider them as isoscalar $D^{(*)}K$ and $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ $S$-wave bound states, which are dynamically generated from effective interactions that lead to different Weinberg compositeness scenarios. Matter effects are incorporated through the two-meson loop functions, taking into account the self energies that the $D^{(*)}$, $\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$, $K$, and $\overline{K}$ develop when embedded in a nuclear medium. Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.</description>
