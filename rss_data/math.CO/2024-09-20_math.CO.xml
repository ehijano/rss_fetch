      <title>Lattice polytopes with the minimal volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a lattice polytope of dimension $d$. Let $b(\mathcal{P})$ denote the number of lattice points belonging to the boundary of $\mathcal{P}$ and $c(\mathcal{P})$ that to the interior of $\mathcal{P}$. It follows from the lower bound theorem of Ehrhart polynomials that, when $c &gt; 0$, \[ {\rm vol}(\mathcal{P}) \geq (d \cdot c(\mathcal{P}) + (d-1) \cdot b(\mathcal{P}) - d^2 + 2)/d!, \] where ${\rm vol}(\mathcal{P})$ is the (Lebesgue) volume of $\mathcal{P}$. Pick's formula guarantees that, when $d = 2$, the above inequality is an equality. In the present paper several classes of lattice polytopes for which the equality here holds will be presented.</description>

      <title>Anzahl theorems for disjoint subspaces generating a non-degenerate subspace II: quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve a classical counting problem for non-degenerate quadratic forms defined on a vector space in odd characteristic; given a subspace $\pi$, we determine the number of non-singular subspaces that are trivially intersecting with $\pi$ and span a non-singular subspace with $\pi$. Lower bounds for the quantity of such pairs where $\pi$ is non-singular were first studied in `Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Finite Fields Appl., 2022)', which was later improved for even-dimensional subspaces in `Glasby, Ihringer, Mattheus (Des. Codes Cryptogr., 2023)' and generalised in `Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Linear Algebra Appl., 2022)'. The explicit formulae, which allow us to give the exact proportion and improve the known lower bounds were derived in the symplectic and Hermitian case in `De Boeck and Van de Voorde (Linear Algebra Appl. 2024)'. This paper deals with the more complicated quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Condorcet cycle elections with influential voting blocs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Condorcet cycle election is an election (often called a Social Welfare Function, or SWF) between three candidates, where each voter ranks the three candidates according to a fixed cyclic order. Maskin showed that if such a SWF obeys the MIIA condition, and respects the complete anonymity of each voter, then it must be a Borda election, where each voter assigns two points to their preferred candidate, one to their second preference and none to their least preferred candidate.
  We introduce a relaxed anonymity condition called ``transitive anonymity'', whereby a group $G$ acting transitively on the set of voters $V$ maintains the outcome of the SWF. Elections across multiple constituencies of equal size are common examples of elections with transitive anonymity but without full anonymity. First, we demonstrate that under this relaxed anonymity condition, non-Borda elections do exist. On the other hand, by modifying Kalai's proof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which employs methods from the analysis of Boolean functions, we show that this can only occur when the number of voters is not a multiple of three, and we demonstrate that even these non-Borda elections are very close to being Borda.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Counting Group Colorings in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jaeger et al. in 1992 introduced group coloring as the dual concept to group connectivity in graphs. Let $\Gamma$ be an Abelian group, $ f: E(G)\to\Gamma$ and $D$ an orientation of a graph $G$. A vertex coloring $c:V(G)\to\Gamma$ is a $(\Gamma, f)$-coloring if $c(v)-c(u)\ne f(e)$ for each edge $e=uv$ and the corresponding arc $D(e)=(u,v)$ directed from $u$ to $v$. We introduce the concept of $\alpha$-compatible graphs and define the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G, \alpha; k)$ at $k$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs, where $\alpha$ is an assigning of $G$ from its cycles to $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $(\Gamma,f)$-colorings for any Abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $k$ and $f:E(G)\to\Gamma$ such that the assigning $\alpha_{D,f}$ induced by $f$ equals $\alpha$. In particular, $P(G,\alpha;k)$ is the classical chromatic polynomial if $\alpha(C)=0$ for any cycle $C$ of $G$. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles and interpret $P(G,\alpha;k)$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that do not contain $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles. This implies that the absolute value of the coefficient of $k^{r(G)-i}$ in $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that have $i$ edges and contain no $\alpha$-compatible broken cycles, which generalizes the Whitney's Broken Cycle Theorem. Based on the combinatorial explanation, we establish a unified order-preserving relation from assignings to cycle-assigning polynomials. Finally, we show that for any loopless graphs $G$, the coefficients of the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ are nonzero and alternate in sign, and further conjecture that the sequence of absolute values of its coefficients is unimodal and log-concave.</description>

      <title>Universal partial tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A De Bruijn cycle is a cyclic sequence in which every word of length $n$ over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ appears exactly once. De Bruijn tori are a two-dimensional analogue. Motivated by recent progress on universal partial cycles and words, which shorten De Bruijn cycles using a wildcard character, we introduce universal partial tori and matrices. We find them computationally and construct infinitely many of them using one-dimensional variants of universal cycles, including a new variant called a universal partial family.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for Gowers norms on discrete cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal dimensionless inequalities $$ \|f\|_{U^k} \leq \|f\|_{\ell^{p_{k,n}}} $$ that hold for all functions $f\colon\mathbb{Z}^d\to\mathbb{C}$ supported in $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^d$ and estimates $$ \|1_A\|_{U^k}^{2^k}\leq |A|^{t_{k,n}} $$ that hold for all subsets $A$ of the same discrete cubes. A general theory, analogous to the work of de Dios Pont, Greenfeld, Ivanisvili, and Madrid, is developed to show that the critical exponents are related by $p_{k,n} t_{k,n} = 2^k$. This is used to prove the three main results of the paper: an explicit formula for $t_{k,2}$, which generalizes a theorem by Kane and Tao, two-sided asymptotic estimates for $t_{k,n}$ as $n\to\infty$ for a fixed $k\geq2$, which generalize a theorem by Shao, and a precise asymptotic formula for $t_{k,n}$ as $k\to\infty$ for a fixed $n\geq2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the key map on crystals can be reduced to the simply-laced types by using virtualization of crystals. For this we use the original definition of virtualization coming from the dilation of crystals by Kashiwara. As a direct application we obtain algorithms to compute orthogonal evacuation, keys and Demazure atoms in type B in terms of Kasiwara-Nakashima tableaux. In particular, we are able to use type A and C methods. For type C, we apply the results obtained by Azenhas-Tarighat Feller-Torres, Azenhas-Santos and Santos.</description>

      <title>List Conflict-free Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by its application in the frequency assignment problem for cellular networks, conflict-free coloring was first studied by Even et al. in [Conflict-free colorings of simple geometric regions with applications to frequency assignment in cellular networks, SIAM Journal on Computing, 2004]. A \emph{conflict-free coloring} of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the \emph{conflict-free chromatic number} of $\mathcal{H}$. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph.
  In this paper, we study the list variant of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$. We prove upper bounds for the list conflict-free chromatic number of general hypergraphs and graphs.</description>

      <title>Exact Values and Bounds for Ramsey Numbers of $C_4$ Versus a Star Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 8 unknown values of the Ramsey numbers $R(C_4,K_{1,n})$ for $n \leq 37$ are determined, showing that $R(C_4,K_{1,27}) = 33$ and $R(C_4,K_{1,n}) = n + 7$ for $28 \leq n \leq 33$ or $n = 37$. Additionally, the following results are proven:
  $\bullet$ If $n$ is even and $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$ is odd, then $R(C_4,K_{1,n}) \leq n + \left\lceil\sqrt{n-\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil+2}\right\rceil + 1$.
  $\bullet$ If $m \equiv 2 \,(\text{mod } 6)$ with $m \geq 8$, then $R(C_4,K_{1,m^2+3}) \leq m^2 + m + 4$.
  $\bullet$ If $R(C_4,K_{1,n}) &gt; R(C_4,K_{1,n-1})$, then $R(C_4,K_{1,2n+1-R(C_4,K_{1,n})}) \geq n$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of weighted quadrant walks: criteria for algebraicity and D-finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of enumeration of weighted walks confined to the quarter plane, it is known that the generating functions behave very differently depending on the chosen step set; in practice, the techniques used in the literature depend on the complexity of the counting series. In this paper we introduce a unified approach based on the theory of elliptic functions, which allows us to have a common proof of the characterisation of the algebraicity and D-finiteness of the generating functions.</description>

      <title>Graphs with constant links and induced Tur\'an numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of constant link $L$ is a graph in which the neighborhood of any vertex induces a graph isomorphic to $L$. Given two different graphs, $H$ and $G$, the induced Tur\'an number ${\rm ex}(n; H, G{\rm -ind})$ is defined as the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph having no subgraph isomorphic to $H$ and no copy from $G$ as an induced subgraph.
  Our main motivation in this paper is to establish a bridge between graphs with constant link and induced Tur\'an numbers via the class of $t$-regular, $k$-uniform (linear) hypergraphs of girth at least $4$, as well as to present several methods of constructing connected graphs with constant link.
  We show that, for integers $t \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$, ${\rm ex}(n; C_k, K_{1,t}{\rm -ind}) \leq (k - 2)(t - 1)n/2$ and that equality holds for infinitely many values of $n$. This result is built upon the existence of graphs with constant link $tL$ with restricted cycle length, which we prove in another theorem. More precisely, we show that, given a graph $F$ with constant link $L$ and circumference $c$, then, for all integers $t \geq 2$ and $g &gt; c$, there exists a graph with constant link $tL$ which is free of cycles of length $l$, for all $c &lt; l &lt; g$. We provide two proofs of this result using distinct approaches. We further present constructions of graphs with constant links $tL$, $t \geq 2$, and restricted cycle length based on Steiner Systems. Finally, starting from a connected graph of constant link $tL$, for $t \geq 2$, having order $n$ and restricted cycle lengths, we provide a method to construct an infinite collection of connected graphs of constant link $tL$ that preserves the cycle length restriction, and whose orders form an arithmetic progression $qn$, $q \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>On $e$-positivity of trees and connected partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a tree with a vertex of degree at least five must be missing a connected partition of some type and therefore its chromatic symmetric function cannot be $e$-positive. We prove that this also holds for a tree with a vertex of degree four as long as it is not adjacent to any leaf. This brings us very close to the conjecture by Dahlberg, She, and van Willigenburg of non-$e$-positivity for all trees with a vertex of degree at least four. We also prove that spiders with four legs cannot have an $e$-positive chromatic symmetric function.</description>

      <title>Maximum shattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ shatters a set $A \subseteq [n]$ if for every $A' \subseteq A$ there is an $F \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $F \cap A=A'$. What is the maximum possible number of subsets of $[n]$ of size $d$ that can be shattered by a family of size $k$? Denote this number by $f(n,k,d)$. We determine $f(n,2^d,d)$ precisely whenever $2^d-1$ divides $n$, showing that this number is $\frac{c_d}{d!}n^d$, where $c_d$ is the probability that $d$ independent uniformly random vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$ are linearly independent. We also show that if $d$ and $n$ grow, with both $d$ and $n-d$ tending to infinity, then $f(n,2^d,d)=(1+o(1))c\binom{n}{d}$, where $c$, roughly $0.289$, is the limit of $c_d$ as $d$ tends to infinity. The case $k&gt;2^d$ is considered as well; for $d \leq 2$ we determine $f(n,k,d)$ precisely for all $n$ and $k$, but the case $d \geq 3$ and $k&gt;2^d$ is much less understood.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Metric Dimensions of Leafless Cacti Graphs with Application in Supply Chain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A resolving set for a simple graph $G$ is a subset of vertex set of $G$ such that it distinguishes all vertices of $G$ using the shortest distance from this subset. This subset is a metric basis if it is the smallest set with this property. A resolving set is a fault tolerant resolving set if the removal of any vertex from the subset still leaves it a resolving set. The smallest set satisfying this property is the fault tolerant metric basis, and the cardinality of this set is termed as fault tolerant metric dimension of $G$, denoted by $\beta'(G)$. In this article, we determine the fault tolerant metric dimension of bicyclic graphs of type-I and II and show that it is always $4$ for both types of graphs. We then use these results to form our basis to consider leafless cacti graphs, and calculate their fault tolerant metric dimensions in terms of \textit{inner cycles} and \textit{outer cycles}. We then consider a detailed real world example of supply and distribution center management, and discuss the application of fault tolerant metric dimension in such a scenario. We also briefly discuss some other scenarios where leafless cacti graphs can be used to model real world problems.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new proof of a theorem of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il [J. Comb. Theory B, 48(1):92-110, 1990] using tools from topological combinatorics based on ideas of Lov\'asz [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 25(3):319-324, 1978]. The Hell-Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il Theorem provides a dichotomy of the graph homomorphism problem. It states that deciding whether there is a graph homomorphism from a given graph to a fixed graph $H$ is in P if $H$ is bipartite (or contains a self-loop), and is NP-complete otherwise. In our proof we combine topological combinatorics with the algebraic approach to constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we provide a perspective of Knapp's example and treat our Diophantine approximation as its analog in $\mathbb{R}$, that naturally leads to the sharpness of Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. These are alternatives of recent examples due to Fraser-Hambrook-Ryou. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

Abstract: In 2017, Walter Taylor showed that there exist $2$-dimensional simplicial complexes which admit the structure of topological modular lattice but not topological distributive lattice. We give a positive answer to his question as to whether $n$-dimensional simplicial complexes with the same property exist. We do this by giving, for each $n\ge2$, an infinite family of compact simplicial complexes which admit the structure of topological modular lattice but not topological distributive lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the set defined by a M\"obius transformation of positive integers is a set of multiplicative recurrence. A Khinchin-type lower bound is also established. This not only answers a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun but also strengthens their result. The key input in our proof is Tao's logarithmically averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Self-adhesivity in lattices of abstract conditional independence models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic concept of the frame for abstract conditional independence (CI) models, together with basic operations with respect to which such a frame should be closed: copying and marginalization. Three standard examples of such frames are (discrete) probabilistic CI structures, semi-graphoids and structural semi-graphoids. We concentrate on those frames which are closed under the operation of set-theoretical intersection because, for these, the respective families of CI models are lattices. This allows one to apply the results from lattice theory and formal concept analysis to describe such families in terms of implications among CI statements.
  The central concept of this paper is that of self-adhesivity defined in algebraic terms, which is a combinatorial reflection of the self-adhesivity concept studied earlier in context of polymatroids and information theory. The generalization also leads to a self-adhesivity operator defined on the hyper-level of CI frames. We answer some of the questions related to this approach and raise other open questions.
  The core of the paper is in computations. The combinatorial approach to computation might overcome some memory and space limitation of software packages based on polyhedral geometry, in particular, if SAT solvers are utilized. We characterize some basic CI families over 4 variables in terms of canonical implications among CI statements. We apply our method in information-theoretical context to the task of entropic region demarcation over 5 variables.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>Weight Enumerators of codes over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and over $\mathbb{Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weight enumerators are important tools for deciphering the algebraic structure of the related code spaces and for understanding group actions on these spaces. Our study focuses on symmetrized weight enumerators of pairs of Type II codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ and the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$. These pairs have been examined as invariants for a specified group. In particular, we concentrate on the scenarios where the space of the invariant ring is of degree 8 and 16. Our findings show that in certain situations, the ring produced by the symmetrized weight enumerators precisely matches with the invariant ring of the designated group. This coincidence points to a profound relationship between the invariant ring's structure and the algebraic characteristics of the weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Towards an optimal hypergraph container lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypergraph container lemma is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics that has found many applications since it was first proved a decade ago. Roughly speaking, it asserts that the family of independent sets of every uniform hypergraph can be covered by a small number of almost-independent sets, called containers. In this article, we formulate and prove two new versions of the lemma that display the following three attractive features. First, they both admit short and simple proofs that have surprising connections to other well-studied topics in probabilistic combinatorics. Second, they use alternative notions of almost-independence in order to describe the containers. Third, they yield improved dependence of the number of containers on the uniformity of the hypergraph, hitting a natural barrier for second-moment-type approaches.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.</description>

      <title>On the Reduced Gr\"obner Bases of Blockwise Determinantal Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockwise determinantal ideals are those generated by the union of all the minors of specified sizes in certain blocks of a generic matrix, and they are the natural generalization of many existing determinantal ideals like the Schubert and ladder ones. In this paper we establish several criteria to verify whether the Gr\"obner bases of blockwise determinantal ideals with respect to (anti-)diagonal term orders are minimal or reduced. In particular, for Schubert determinantal ideals, while all the elusive minors form the reduced Gr\"obner bases when the defining permutations are vexillary, in the non-vexillary case we derive an explicit formula for computing the reduced Gr\"obner basis from elusive minors which avoids all algebraic operations. The fundamental properties of being normal and strong for W-characteristic sets and characteristic pairs, which are heavily connected to the reduced Gr\"obner bases, of Schubert determinantal ideals are also proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hilbert polynomials have positivity properties under favorable conditions. We establish a similar "K-theoretic positivity" for matroids. As an application, for a multiplicity-free subvariety of a product of projective spaces such that the projection onto one of the factors has birational image, we show that a transformation of its K-polynomial is Lorentzian. This partially answers a conjecture of Castillo, Cid-Ruiz, Mohammadi, and Montano. As another application, we show that the h*-vector of a simplicially positive divisor on a matroid is a Macaulay vector, affirmatively answering a question of Speyer for a new infinite family of matroids.</description>

Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{D_n}{m^n} $$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(-1)^nA_n$ modulo $p^3$, where $p$ is an odd prime representable by some suitable binary quadratic form, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$, $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$, $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}k\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ and $A_n$ is the Ap\'ery number given by $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
