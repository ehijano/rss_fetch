      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of molten salts: insights from molecular dynamics simulations and fundamental bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in two common molten salts, LiF and KCl. Our analysis includes the total thermal conductivity and intrinsic conductivity involving mass currents measured experimentally. The latter shows good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate their key thermodynamic properties such as constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats. We subsequently compare the results to the lower bound for thermal diffusivity expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. Using this comparison and recent theoretical insights into thermodynamic and transport properties in liquids, we interpret thermal properties on the basis of atomistic dynamics and phonon excitations. We finally find that thermal diffusivity of molten salts is close to their kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>Free-energy landscape of a polymer in the presence of two nanofluidic entropic traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, nanofluidics experiments have been used to characterize the behavior of single DNA molecules confined to narrow slits etched with arrays of nanopits. Analysis of the experimental data relies on analytical estimates of the underlying free-energy landscape. In this study we use computer simulations to explicitly calculate the free energy and test the approximations employed in such analytical models. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations were used to study a polymer confined to complex geometry consisting of a nanoslit with two square nanopits embedded in one of the surfaces. The two-dimensional Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM2D) is used to calculate the free energy, $F$, as a function of the sum ($\lambda_1$) and the difference ($\lambda_2$) of the length of the polymer contour contained in the two nanopits. We find the variation of the free-energy function with respect to confinement dimensions to be comparable to the analytical predictions that employ a simplistic theoretical model. However, there are some noteworthy quantitative discrepancies, particularly between the predicted and observed variation of $F$ with respect to $\lambda_1$. Our study provides a useful lesson on the limitations of using simplistic analytical expressions for polymer free-energy landscapes to interpret results for experiments of DNA confined to a complex geometry and points to the value of carrying out accurate numerical calculations of the free energy instead.</description>

      <title>Freely Suspended Nematic and Smectic Films and Free-Standing Smectic Filaments in the Ferroelectric Nematic Realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that stable, freely suspended liquid crystal films can be made from the ferroelectric nematic ($\mathrm{N_F}$) phase and from the recently discovered polar, lamellar $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ and $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phases. The $\mathrm{N_F}$ films display two-dimensional, smectic-like parabolic focal conic textures comprising director/polarization bend that are a manifestation of the electrostatic suppression of director splay in the film plane. In the $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ and $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phases, the smectic layers orient preferentially normal to the film surfaces, a condition never found in typical thermotropic or lyotropic lamellar LC phases, with the $\mathrm{SmZ_A}$ films exhibiting focal-conic fan textures mimicking the appearance of typical smectics in glass cells when the layers are oriented normal to the plates, and the $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ films showing a texture of plaquettes of uniform in-plane orientation where both bend and splay are suppressed, separated by grain boundaries. The $\mathrm{SmA_F}$ phase can also be drawn into thin filaments, in which X-ray scattering reveals that the smectic layer planes are normal to the filament axis. Remarkably, the filaments are mechanically stable even if they break, forming free-standing, fluid filaments supported only at one end. The unique architectures of these films and filaments are stabilized by the electrostatic self-interaction of the liquid crystal polarization field, which enables the formation of confined, fluid structures that are fundamentally different from those of their counterparts made using previously known liquid crystal phases.</description>

      <title>Controlled formation of multi-scale porosity in ionosilica templated by ionic liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoporous systems are ubiquitous in membrane science and applications due to their high internal surface area and tunable pore size. A new synthesis pathway of hydrolytic ionosilica films with mesopores formed by ionic liquid (IL) templating is proposed and compared to the traditional non-hydrolytic strategy. For both pathways, the multi-scale formation of pores has been studied as a function of IL content, combining results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nitrogen sorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The combination of TGA and nitrogen sorption provides access to ionosilica and pore volume fractions, with contributions of meso- and macropores. We then elaborate an original and quantitative geometrical model to analyze the SAXS data based on small spheres (Rs = 1 -- 2 nm) and cylinders (Lcyl = 10 -- 20 nm) with radial polydispersity provided by the nitrogen sorption isotherms. As a main result, we found that for a given incorporation of templating IL, both synthesis pathways produce very similar pore geometries, but the better incorporation efficacy of the new hydrolytic films provides a higher mesoporosity. Our combined study provides a coherent view of mesopore geometry, and thereby an optimization pathway of porous ionic membranes in terms of accessible mesoporosity contributing to the specific surface. Possible applications include electrolyte membranes of improved ionic properties, e.g., in fuel cells and batteries, as well as molecular storage.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Brownian Barrier: Models and Manifestations of Molecular Diffusion in Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a century ago, Einstein formulated a precise mathematical model for describing Brownian motion. While this model adequately explains the diffusion of micron-sized particles in fluids, its limitations become apparent when applied to molecular self-diffusion in fluids. The foundational principles of Gaussianity and Markovianity, central to the Brownian diffusion paradigm, are insufficient for describing molecular diffusion, particularly in complex fluids characterized by intricate intermolecular interactions and hindered relaxation processes. This perspective delves into the nuanced behavior observed in diverse complex fluids, including molecular self-assembly, deep eutectic solvents, and ionic liquids, with a specific focus on modeling self-diffusion within these media. We explore the potential of extending diffusion models to incorporate non-Gaussian and non-Markovian effects by augmenting the Brownian model using non-local diffusion equations. Further, we validate the applicability of these models by utilizing them to describe results from quasielastic neutron scattering and MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic thinning of a coating film induced by a small solid defect: evidence of a time-minimum thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During coating processes, dust deposition can lead to an uneven thickness in the resulting film, posing significant problems in industrial processes. Our study explores the effects of solid defects using a vertical cylindrical fiber deposited on a silicone oil film coating a horizontal solid substrate. We use a hyperspectral camera to measure the film thickness by interferometry in the vicinity of the defect. As predicted and observed in many studies in various geometries, a circular groove appears around the fiber because of the capillary suction induced by the meniscus that grows at the bottom of the fiber. We measure the evolution of the thickness of the film at the groove over time. The thickness decreases before increasing again leading to the healing of the perturbation at long time. We propose that healing is due to the arrest of the suction when the meniscus reaches its equilibrium shape. By combining geometric analysis with the thin film equation, we have developed scaling laws that predict both the minimum thickness of the groove, that we call the time-minimum thickness, and the time required to reach this minimum. If the time-minimum thickness reaches the thickness at which intermolecular forces begin to play a role prior to healing, the thickness of the groove will stop decreasing and saturate due to the competition between drainage and repulsive intermolecular forces. Based on the previous scaling law, we developed a scaling law accounting for the critical initial thickness of the film below which the intermolecular repulsion will start to have an effect, which is in good agreement with our experiments. These results thus offer valuable insights into predicting and preventing defects in coating processes, thereby improving the quality and reliability of coated products in various industries.</description>

      <title>Collective chemotactic search strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotactic biological or synthetic active matter shapes its environment by secretions of chemical signals from its self-propelled constituents, like cells, organisms or active colloids. From this indirect interaction collective effects emerge that can be used by the agents to migrate collectively, to form patterns or to search for targets more efficiently. Here, we use paradigmatic models to study the efficiency of collective search strategies of a large group of motile agents that release during their movement repulsive auto-chemotactic signals forcing them to move away from high concentrations of the chemical clue. We show that the repulsive chemotactic interactions improve the search efficiency, measured by the mean first passage time to find a randomly located target, by orders of magnitude depending on the strength of the chemotactic coupling. The mechanism for this improvement relies on two factors: the increase of the persistence length due to the agent's self-interaction with its own chemotactic field and by a more homogeneous distribution of the agents due to their mutual indirect repulsion mediated by the chemotactic field. At stronger particle-field coupling the chemotactic searchers self-organize into ballistically moving bands reminiscent of search-chains formed in search and rescue operations, whose efficiency depends on the number of searchers involved. Our comprehensive study of collective search strategies of large groups of interacting agents is not only relevant for chemotactic active matter but also for a wide range of fields like ethology, information engineering, robotics, and social engineering.</description>

      <title>Why Static Friction Decreases From Single to Multi-asperity Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key parameter for describing frictional strength at the onset of sliding is the static friction coefficient. Yet, how the static friction coefficient at the macroscale emerges from contacting asperities at the microscale is still an open problem. Here, we present friction experiments in which the normal load was varied over more than three orders of magnitude, so that a transition from a single asperity contact at low loads to multi-asperity contacts at high loads was achieved. We find a remarkable drop in static friction coefficient with increasing normal load. Using a simple stick-slip transition model we identify the presence of pre-sliding and subcritical contact points as the cause of smaller static friction coefficient at increased normal loads. Our measurements and model bridge the gap between friction behavior commonly observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments at microscopic forces, and industrially relevant multi-asperity contact interfaces loaded with macroscopic forces.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant percolation in active Brownian hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium clustering and percolation are investigated in an archetypal model of two-dimensional active matter using dynamic simulations of self-propelled Brownian repulsive particles. We concentrate on the single-phase region up to moderate levels of activity, before motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) sets in. Weak activity promotes cluster formation and lowers the percolation threshold. However, driving the system further out of equilibrium partly reverses this effect, resulting in a minimum in the critical density for the formation of system-spanning clusters and introducing re-entrant percolation as a function of activity in the pre-MIPS regime. This non-monotonic behaviour arises from competition between activity-induced effective attraction (which eventually leads to MIPS) and activity-driven cluster breakup. Using an adapted iterative Boltzmann inversion method, we derive effective potentials to map weakly active cases onto a passive (equilibrium) model with conservative attraction, which can be characterised by Monte Carlo simulations. While the active and passive systems have practically identical radial distribution functions, we find decisive differences in higher-order structural correlations, to which the percolation threshold is highly sensitive. For sufficiently strong activity, no passive pairwise potential can reproduce the radial distribution function of the active system.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover via confinement in the lattice Lorentz gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a lattice model in which a tracer particle moves in the presence of randomly distributed immobile obstacles. The crowding effect due to the obstacles interplays with the quasi-confinement imposed by wrapping the lattice onto a cylinder. We compute the velocity autocorrelation function and show that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover from two- to one-dimensional as time progresses. A pulling force is switched on and we characterize analytically the stationary state in terms of the stationary velocity and diffusion coefficient. Stochastic simulations are used to discuss the range of validity of the analytic results. Our calculation, exact to first order in the obstacle density, holds for arbitrarily large forces and confinement size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice model describing the non-equilibrium dynamics emerging from the pulling of a tracer particle through a disordered medium occupied by randomly placed obstacles. The model is considered in a restricted geometry pertinent for the investigation of confinement-induced effects. We analytically derive exact results for the characteristic function of the moments valid to first order in the obstacle density. By calculating the velocity autocorrelation function and its long-time tail we find that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover. This picture is further confirmed by the approach of the drift velocity to its terminal value attained in the non-equilibrium stationary state. At large times the diffusion coefficient is affected by both the driving and confinement in a way that we quantify analytically. The force-induced diffusion coefficient depends sensitively on the presence of confinement. The latter is able to modify qualitatively the non-analytic behavior in the force observed for the unbounded model. We then examine the fluctuations of the tracer particle along the driving force. We show that in the intermediate regime superdiffusive anomalous behavior persists even in the presence of confinement. Stochastic simulations are employed in order to test the validity of the analytic results, exact to first order in the obstacle density and valid for arbitrary force and confinement.</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Onsager's variational principle (OVP) provides us with a systematic way to derive dynamical equations for various soft matter and active matter. By reformulating the Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP), which is a time-global principle, we propose a new method to incorporate thermal fluctuations. To demonstrate the utility of the statistical formulation of OMVP (SOMVP), we obtain the diffusion constant of a Brownian particle embedded in a viscous fluid only by maximizing the modified Onsager-Machlup integral for the surrounding fluid. We also apply our formulation to a Brownian particle in a steady shear flow, which is a typical example of a non-equilibrium system. Possible extensions of our formulation to internally driven active systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Physical phenomena during nanoindentation deformation of amorphous glassy polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify for visco-elasto-plastic (VEP) glassy polymers, physical phenomena during Berkovich nanoindentation, a locally imposed deformation. Live visuals via in situ nanoindentation indicate mainly sink-in during loading, with pile-up after unloading. Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) indicates significant volume conserving upflow below the tip, for these high nu, compliant materials, with compliance correlated high geometric fractional contact (including blunt height, h_b), (h_c+h_b)/(h_m+h_b)~0.86-0.95. We adapt the ideal conical indentation framework to VEP Berkovich nanoindentation, to calculate the contact area and visually depict the upflow and the displacement paths, in the material. The combination of SPM and P-h data, indicates a mixed comparison with uniaxial modulus and yield stress, with conventionally defined hardness, H&lt;3*sig_y, and nanoindentation modulus E_N&gt;E. By rationally removing viscoelastic (VE) effects from the loading P-h data, we find instant, zero-time hardness, H_L0&gt;3*sig_y. We apply the power law model to only the recovery onset, to estimate pure elastic recovery. We then deconvolute the VEP nanoindentation into the conventional EP and elastic contributions, isolating the VE component. Constraint-induced sink-in, pile-up and VE recovery of the highly yielded tip-apex region, mirror the converse constrained deformation effects, governing the trends in conventionally defined H_L0 and E_N for glassy polymers.</description>

Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$ -- one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data. The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>
