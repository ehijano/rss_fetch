      <title>C3NN-SBI: Learning Hierarchies of $N$-Point Statistics from Cosmological Fields with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological analyses are moving past the well understood 2-point statistics to extract more information from cosmological fields. A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example. We view our approach as an exciting new avenue for physics-informed simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>The Sign-Switching of the Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models in which the cosmological constant evolves from negative values in the early Universe to a positive value at low redshifts. This framework includes a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as smooth-transition scenarios, providing a unified description of sign-changing cosmological constants. We analyse the theoretical construction and background dynamics of these models using cosmographic diagnostics. Extending this study to the linear perturbation regime, we solve the perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era with adiabatic initial conditions. We examine the evolution of the matter density contrast, gravitational potential, and the $f\sigma_8$ observable. Our results are compared against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and confronted with current observational data, illustrating the phenomenological viability of sign-changing dark energy models and revealing distinctive imprints on cosmic structure formation arising from the transition of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Analytical Estimates of Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies from Shot Noise and Large-Scale Structure in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important next step for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is to measure anisotropies in the gravitational wave background (GWB) at $\sim$ nano-Hz frequencies. We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance-duality relation with localized fast radio bursts: a cosmological model-independent study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR), by comparing Type Ia supernova (SNIa) luminosity-distance information from the Pantheon+ compilation with an angular-diameter-distance reconstructed from localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The core of our methodology is a data-driven reconstruction from FRBs using artificial neural networks (ANNs): we infer a smooth mean extragalactic dispersion-measure relation and use its redshift derivative to recover $H(z)$ and hence $D_\mathrm{A}^{\rm FRB}(z)$ without assuming a parametric form for the expansion history. Possible deviations from CDDR are parameterized through three one-parameter models of $\eta(z)\equiv D_\mathrm{L}/[(1+z)^2D_\mathrm{A}]$. We implement two complementary likelihoods: (i) a direct approach using individual SNIa with the full Pantheon+ covariance, and (ii) a machine-learning approach in which we reconstruct the SN Hubble diagram on the FRB redshift grid, propagating SN and FRB uncertainties into non-diagonal covariance matrices via Monte Carlo and bootstrap realizations. Within the FRB reconstruction, we anchor the mean extragalactic dispersion measure at $z=0$, which yields a data-driven constraint on the average host/near-source contribution $\mathrm{DM}_{\rm host}=128.8\pm 34.1\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ ($3\sigma$ of statistical confidence). We find that both likelihood implementations give consistent posteriors and no statistically significant evidence for departures from CDDR at the current precision.</description>

      <title>The Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data II: Smooth Component Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\parallel} \ge [k_\parallel]_f=0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp},k_{3\perp},k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \perp},k_{2 \perp},k_{3 \perp})\leq 0.026~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel},k_{3\parallel})&gt;0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\Delta^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\Delta^3_{\rm LL}=-(1.25\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\Delta^3_{\rm UL}=(1.22\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids evolution in modified gravity via hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models.</description>

      <title>Rescuing Overabundant Dark Matter with a Strongly First Order Phase Transition in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dark sector consisting of fermionic dark matter (DM) charged under a broken dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, interacting with the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift &gt; 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data in cosmology indicate a small, positive, and nonvanishing cosmological constant that dominates the energy budget of the present universe. The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic galactic supernova flux of semi-relativistic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Light dark sector via thermal decays of Dark Matter: the case of a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental observations, most notably those reported by the ATOMKI and Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) collaborations, have hinted anomalies that may indicate the presence of a new resonance with a mass around $17\,\text{MeV}$, potentially interacting with both nucleons and electrons. Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$.
  Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Precision Inflationary Predictions: Impact of Accurate End-of-Inflation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision era of cosmology demands accurate theoretical predictions from inflationary models. In quantitative reheating analyses, inflationary observables depend sensitively on the number of e-folds between horizon exit and the end of inflation, $N_k$, whose determination relies on slow-roll approximations near the end of inflation. Since inflation ends when the first slow-roll parameter reaches unity, even modest inaccuracies in this approximation can shift the end of inflation and thereby alter $N_k$, leading to modifications in predicted observables -- including those evaluated at leading order. While such effects are implicit in standard treatments, their quantitative impact on observable constraints has not been systematically assessed. In this work, we first re-evaluate leading-order slow-roll predictions using an improved determination of $N_k$ within a simple quantitative reheating framework, and then incorporate higher-order slow-roll corrections consistently with the revised background evolution. Applying this framework to the Starobinsky model, we find that improved end-of-inflation dynamics alone can induce shifts of order $\Delta n_s \sim 10^{-3}$, while higher-order slow-roll corrections provide additional refinements at the $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$ level. The cumulative effect results in a maximum shift of $\Delta n_s \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ within the allowed reheating range. These results demonstrate that an accurate determination of the end of inflation is essential for precision tests of inflationary models.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scatter off the free-electron gas in galaxies and clusters, allowing us to use the CMB as a backlight to probe the gas in and around low-redshift galaxies. The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, sourced by hot electrons in high-density environments, measures the thermal pressure of the target objects, shedding light on halo thermodynamics and galaxy formation and providing a path toward understanding the baryon distribution around cosmic structures. We use a combination of high-resolution CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and photometric luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in four redshift bins from $z=0.4$ to $z=1.2$, with a combined detection significance of 19$\sigma$ when stacking on the fiducial CMB Compton-$y$ map. We discuss possible sources of contamination, finding that residual dust emission associated with the target galaxies is important and limits current analyses. We discuss several mitigation strategies and quantify the residual modelling uncertainty. This work complements closely related measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and weak lensing of the same galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Constraint on Dark Matter Self-Interaction from Combined Strong Lensing and Stellar Kinematics in MACS J0138-2155</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20179</link>

Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m &lt; 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\langle v_\text{pair}\rangle &lt; 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting the hidden population of low-mass haloes in strong lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are degenerate with the population signal. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history.
  We show that even mild departures from $\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past.
  We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Constraints from NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\Omega_1\Omega_2}$-$\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM: A promising phenomenological extension of the standard model of cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a phenomenological extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers $\Lambda$CDM and introduces two additional terms, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, in the dark energy sector alongside the cosmological constant, leading to a physically interpretable and observationally testable effective dark energy dynamics. Using Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find that the model allows additional freedom in the late-time expansion history while preserving standard early-universe physics. When DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data are included, the inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 69.74 \pm 0.77~\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), consistent with Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) measurements from the Carnegie--Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP). The reconstructed dark energy equation of state exhibits a smooth transition across the phantom divide followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior, modifying late-time dynamics while maintaining standard early-time cosmology. Overall, controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM improve cosmological concordance.</description>

      <title>Redshift-binned constraints on the Hubble constant under $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and Pad\'e cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent claims of a possible redshift dependence in late-Universe determinations of the Hubble constant (H_0), we test the robustness of this behavior using multiple cosmological probes. We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of H_0 across eight bins using late-Universe probes including Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers under three cosmological frameworks: flat Lambda cold dark matter, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, and Pade cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar low-amplitude variation in the per-bin H_0 estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behavior, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about 1.71-1.94 sigma, with similar behavior observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (supernova-only, cosmic chronometer-only, BAO-only) yield ratios H_0,i / H_0,global mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for {H_0, Omega_m, M, r_d}, we find that a baselinelike oscillatory pattern reemerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only H_0 is bin dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behavior of H_0(z) in late time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed, focusing on first-order phase transitions from spontaneous lepton number breaking.</description>

      <title>OzDES Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei: Final Data Release, Black-Hole Mass Results, &amp; Scaling Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range 0.13-3.85 and bolometric luminosity range 44.3 - 47.5 erg/s. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the H\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the H\b{eta} and MgII lines with a scatter of ~0.25 dex, the tightest yet identified, fit specifically for consistency with high redshift AGN. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects arising from finite survey length. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN with single epoch methods. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the H\b{eta}, MgII and CIV emitting regions. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and a set of significantly improved radius-luminosity relations for use with high-redshift populations.</description>
