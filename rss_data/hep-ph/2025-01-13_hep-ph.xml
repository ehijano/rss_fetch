      <title>Piezoelectric Bulk Acoustic Resonators For Dark Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetically mixed dark photon is a simple, testable dark matter candidate with strong theoretical motivation. Detecting the feeble electric field dark photon dark matter produces requires extremely sensitive detectors. Bulk acoustic resonators (BARs), with their exceptionally high-quality phonon modes, are capable of achieving incredible sensitivity to gravitational waves in the MHz to GHz frequency range. The BAR phonons are typically read out by detecting the electric field generated by the BAR materials' piezoelectricity. Here we show that this piezoelectricity also rewards such detectors sensitivity to dark photon dark matter, as the dark electric field can resonantly excite BAR phonons. A single 10 g piezoelectric BAR in a large, cold, environment can be orders of magnitude more sensitive to the kinetic mixing parameter than any current experiment, with only a month-long exposure and thermally-limited backgrounds.</description>

      <title>On the Atomki nuclear anomaly after the MEG-II result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$ with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>On the extraction of $\alpha_\textit{em}(m_Z^2)$ at Tera-$Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current projected sensitivity on the electromagnetic coupling $\alpha_\textit{em}(m_Z^2)$ represents a bottleneck for the precision electroweak program at FCC-ee. We propose a novel methodology to extract this coupling directly from $Z$-pole data. By comparing the differential distribution of electrons, muons and positrons in the forward region, the approach achieves a projected statistical sensitivity below the $10^{-5}$ level, representing a significant improvement over other methods. We assess the impact of leading parametric uncertainties including that of the top quark mass.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-${\alpha_{ C}}$: Learning point cloud calorimeter simulations using generative transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the first use of generative transformers for generating calorimeter showers as point clouds in a high-granularity calorimeter. Using the tokenizer and generative part of the OmniJet-${\alpha}$ model, we represent the hits in the detector as sequences of integers. This model allows variable-length sequences, which means that it supports realistic shower development and does not need to be conditioned on the number of hits. Since the tokenization represents the showers as point clouds, the model learns the geometry of the showers without being restricted to any particular voxel grid.</description>

      <title>CP violation analysis of $D^0\to M^0 K \to M^0(\pi^\pm \ell^\mp \nu)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in the charm sector is highly sensitive to new physics due to its small predicted value within the standard model. By this work, we investigated the CP violation in the cascade decay process $D^0(t_1) \to \pi^0 K(t_2) \to \pi^0(\pi^\pm \ell^\mp \nu)$. Our results indicate that the CP violation induced by the interference of unmixed $D$-meson decay amplitudes dominates, with a peak value reaching $5 \times 10^{-3}$. This is one order of magnitude larger than the sub-leading contribution, namely the double-mixing CP violation. Furthermore, the CP violation in the decay channel with the semileptonic final state $\pi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ is one to two orders of magnitude larger than that in the channel with $ \pi^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$. We propose that the CP asymmetry of the combined two decay channels can be measured experimentally. The resulting value is approximately half of the CP violation observed in the $\pi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ channel, with the dominant contribution still reaching the order of $10^{-3}$. This approach offers the advantage of eliminating the need for flavor tagging of the initial $D$ meson, thereby avoiding associated efficiency losses.</description>

      <title>Dark matter stabilized by a non-abelian group: lessons from the $\Sigma(36)$ 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When building dark matter (DM) models, one often imposes conserved discrete symmetries to stabilize DM candidates. The simplest choice is ${\mathbb Z}_2$ but models with larger stabilizing groups have also been explored. Can a conserved non-abelian group lead to a viable DM model? Here, we address this question within the three-Higgs-doublet model based on the group $\Sigma(36)$, in which DM stabilization by a non-abelian group is not only possible but inevitable. We show that the tight connections between the Higgs, fermion, and DM sectors repeatedly drive the model into conflict with the LHC results and DM observations, with the most recent LZ results playing a decisive role. We believe that the lessons learned from this study help chart the limits of what can be achieved within multi-Higgs-doublet DM models with large symmetry groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor-changing signatures of Lorentz and CPT violation involving muon-electron conversions in muonic atoms are studied using effective field theory. Constraints on coefficients for Lorentz violation at parts in $10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for flavor-changing electromagnetic muon decays and parts in $10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-2}$ for flavor-changing 4-point quark-lepton interactions are extracted using existing data from the SINDRUM II experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Estimates are provided for sensitivities attainable in the forthcoming experiments Mu2e at Fermilab and COMET at the Japan Proton Accelerator Complex.</description>

      <title>The all-charm tetraquark and its contribution to two-photon processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompted by several potential tetraquark states that have been reported by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS collaborations in the di-$J/\Psi$ and $J/\Psi \Psi(2S)$ spectra, we investigate their contribution to two-photon processes. Within a non-relativistic potential model for the all-charm tetraquark states, we calculate the two-photon decay widths of these states, and test model independent sum rule predictions. Imposing such sum rule constraints allows us to predict the light-by-light scattering cross sections in a consistent way and check if any excess, in comparison to the Standard Model prediction, as reported by ongoing ATLAS experiments can be attributed to intermediate exotic states.</description>

      <title>Scattering with depletion in strong, focussed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical approaches to QED scattering in strong fields typically treat the field as a fixed background with simple spacetime dependence, such as a plane wave. Two major challenges are therefore the inclusion of effects due to backreaction (depletion of the field) and spatial geometry (e.g. focussing). We show here that a solution to one problem can solve the other: even if particle wavefunctions in a chosen focussed background are not known, we show that they can be constructed once depletion is accounted for. We demonstrate this by giving the exact wavefunctions in a depleting flying focus beam. We then calculate and analyse the amplitude of non-linear Compton scattering, comparing with the plane wave case. Our methods thus open a new avenue of investigation in which two previously challenging effects are simultaneously brought under analytic control.</description>

      <title>Late-time Cosmology without Dark Sector but with Closed String Massless Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of solving the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that \textit{the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating}. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector or coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Learning for Inverse Problems in Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning techniques and physics-driven designs is reforming the way we address inverse problems, in which accurate physical properties are extracted from complex data sets. This is particularly relevant for quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, with its inherent limitations in observational data and demanding computational approaches. This perspective highlights advances and potential of physics-driven learning methods, focusing on predictions of physical quantities towards QCD physics, and drawing connections to machine learning(ML). It is shown that the fusion of ML and physics can lead to more efficient and reliable problem-solving strategies. Key ideas of ML, methodology of embedding physics priors, and generative models as inverse modelling of physical probability distributions are introduced. Specific applications cover first-principle lattice calculations, and QCD physics of hadrons, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. These examples provide a structured and concise overview of how incorporating prior knowledge such as symmetry, continuity and equations into deep learning designs can address diverse inverse problems across different physical sciences.</description>

      <title>Automatizing the search for mass resonances using BumpNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for resonant mass bumps in invariant-mass distributions remains a cornerstone strategy for uncovering Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Traditional methods often rely on predefined functional forms and exhaustive computational and human resources, limiting the scope of tested final states and selections. This work presents BumpNet, a machine learning-based approach leveraging advanced neural network architectures to generalize and enhance the Data-Directed Paradigm (DDP) for resonance searches. Trained on a diverse dataset of smoothly-falling analytical functions and realistic simulated data, BumpNet efficiently predicts statistical significance distributions across varying histogram configurations, including those derived from LHC-like conditions. The network's performance is validated against idealized likelihood ratio-based tests, showing minimal bias and strong sensitivity in detecting mass bumps across a range of scenarios. Additionally, BumpNet's application to realistic BSM scenarios highlights its capability to identify subtle signals while managing the look-elsewhere effect. These results underscore BumpNet's potential to expand the reach of resonance searches, paving the way for more comprehensive explorations of LHC data in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Features of Amplitudes in Planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planar three-gluon form factor for the chiral stress tensor operator in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is an analog of the Higgs-to-three-gluon scattering amplitude in QCD. The amplitude (symbol) bootstrap program has provided a wealth of high-loop perturbative data about this form factor, with results up to eight loops available. The symbol of the form factor at $L$ loops is given by words of length $2L$ in six letters with associated integer coefficients. In this paper, we analyze this data, describing patterns of zero coefficients and relations between coefficients. We find many sequences of words whose coefficients are given by closed-form expressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order. Moreover, motivated by our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion relations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of particular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for understanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Classification of $T^2/Z_m$ orbifold boundary conditions in $SO(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generally classify the equivalence classes of the $T^2/Z_m$ $(m=2,3,4,6)$ orbifold boundary conditions (BCs) for the $SO(N)$ gauge group. Higher-dimensional gauge theories are defined by gauge groups, matter field contents, and the BCs. The numerous patterns of the BCs are classified into the finite equivalence classes, each of which consists of the physically equivalent BCs. In this paper, we reconstruct the canonical forms of the BCs for the $SO(N)$ gauge group through the ``re-orthogonalization method."

      <title>Searches for Top-associated Dark Matter Production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent searches for dark matter (DM) produced in association with top quarks from the ATLAS and CMS experiments using data collected between 2015 and 2018 are presented. These comprise searches from both experiments for DM in association with a single top quark; an improved ATLAS search for DM in single lepton $t\bar{t}$ final states; an ATLAS search stop squarks decaying to a top quark, a charm quark and neutralinos, and a CMS search for DM produced in association with a pair of top quarks or a single top. These analyses feature novel machine learning and advanced background estimation techniques. No statistically significant excess is observed in any of these searches.</description>

      <title>Detecting LHC Neutrinos at Surface Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC not only marks the beginning of a novel collider neutrino program at CERN but also motivates considering additional neutrino detectors to fully exploit the associated physics potential. We investigate the feasibility and physics potential of neutrino experiments located at the surface-level. A topographic desk study was performed to identify all points at which the LHC's neutrino beams exit the earth. The closest location lies about 9 km east of the CMS interaction point, at the bottom of Lake Geneva. Several detectors to be placed at this location are considered, including a water Cherenkov detector and an emulsion detector. The detector concepts are introduced, and projections for their contribution to the LHC forward neutrino program and searches for dark sector particles are presented. However, the dilution of the neutrino flux over distance reduces the neutrino yield significantly, limiting the physics potential of surface-level detectors compared to ones closer to the interaction point, including the proposed FPF.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson decays to a fermion pair and a polarized $Z$ boson at NLO accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.04858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Higgs boson decay process $H\to f\bar{f}Z\to f\bar{f}\mu^-\mu^+$, where $f$ denotes any light fermions, at the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. The calculation is performed within the framework of single-pole approximation, in which the contributions of different polarization states of the $Z$ boson are considered separately. Numerical results show that, by taking appropriate cut, the non-resonant background is negligible, and the NLO corrections are $1\%$--$4\%$ of the LO contributions. We also find that the inclusion of NLO corrections can greatly reduce the dependence on the electroweak coupling scheme, and enhance the prediction reliability. We formulate a method for the extraction of the pseudo-observable $\Gamma^{H\to ffZ}$ from the $f\bar{f}\mu^-\mu^+$ signal.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of neutrino mass ordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03463v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the mixing phenomenon of a neutral meson formed by a fictitious massive quark will disappear, if the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) is restored at a high energy scale. This disappearance is taken as the high-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the width difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the dispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then connects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark masses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is demonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$ and $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured values. In particular, the known numerical relation $V_{us}\approx \sqrt{m_s/m_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m_s$ ($m_b$) can be derived analytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing of the $\mu^- e^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with intermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the normal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate spectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements. The lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of the inequality $m_2^2/m_3^2\gg m_s^2/m_b^2$, $m_{2,3}$ being the neutrino masses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\tau^-e^+$-$\tau^+e^-$ mixing specifies the mixing angle $\theta_{23}\approx 45^\circ$, leading to the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry. Our work suggests that the fermion masses and mixing parameters are constrained dynamically, and the neutrino mass orderings can be discriminated by the internal consistency of the SM.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Vector-Like Top-Quark Models in the Alignment Limit of the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive extension of the ordinary 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), supplemented by Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs), in the "alignment limit" is presented. In such a scenario, we study the possibility that Large Hadron Collider (LHC) searches for VLQs can profile their nature too, i.e., whether they belong to a singlet, doublet, or triplet representation. To achieve this, we exploit both Standard Model (SM) decays of VLQs with top-(anti)quark Electromagnetic (EM) charge ($T$), i.e., into $b,t$ quarks and $W^\pm, Z,h$ bosons (which turn out to be suppressed and hence $T$ states can escape existing limits) as well as their exotic decays, i.e., into $b,t$ (and possibly $B$) quarks and $H^\pm, H, A$ bosons. We show that quite specific decay patterns emerge in the different VLQ representations so that, depending upon which $T$ signals are accessed at the LHC, one may be able to ascertain the underlying Beyond Standard Model (BSM) structure, especially if mass knowledge of the new fermionic and bosonic sectors can be inferred from (other) data.</description>

      <title>Thermal axion production at hard and soft momenta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot axions, thermally produced in the Early Universe, would contribute to dark radiation and are thus subject to present and future constraints from $N_{\rm eff}$. In this paper we quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ and its uncertainty in models with axion-gluon couplings from thermal dynamics above the QCD transition. In more detail, we determine the leading-order thermal axion production rate for axion momenta of the order of the temperature adopting three different schemes for the incorporation of the collective dynamics of soft gluons. We show how these three schemes extrapolate differently into the regime of softer axion production, thus giving us a first quantitative handle on the theory uncertainty of the rate. Upon solving the Boltzmann equation, we find that this theory uncertainty translates to an uncertainty of order 0.002 for the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ prior to the QCD crossover. The uncertainty from common momentum-averaged approximations to the Boltzmann equation is smaller. We also discuss how QCD transition dynamics would need to be integrated into our results and we show how existing rate determinations in the literature based on gauge-dependent resummations are problematic.</description>

      <title>A Partially Fixed Background Field Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the incorporation of gauge symmetries in the modern effective field theory (EFT) matching paradigm with a particular focus on spontaneously broken symmetries. The presence of gauge symmetries entails the introduction of gauge-fixing terms in matching calculations, which may prevent (partial) cancellation between loops from the underlying theory and those of the EFT, thereby preventing the establishment of a hard-region matching formula. While this is not an issue when using the background field (BF) gauge for unbroken gauge theories, we find ourselves unable to demonstrate the cancellation with the ordinary BF gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theories when the massive vectors are heavy and decouple from the theory. As a convenient alternative, we construct a partially fixed BF gauge that, in addition to being simpler than the ordinary BF gauge, allows us to prove a hard-region matching formula.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical $x$-space solution for parton evolution -- Application to non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-analytical method for parton evolution. It is based on constructing a family of analytic functions spanning $x$-space which is closed under the considered evolution equation. Using these functions as a basis, the original integro-differential evolution equation transforms into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically by restriction to a suitably chosen finite subsystem. The evolved distributions are obtained as analytic functions in $x$ with numerically obtained coefficients, providing insight into the analytic behavior of the evolved parton distributions. As a proof-of-principle, we apply our method to the leading order non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation. Comparing our results to traditional Mellin-space methods, we find good agreement. The method is implemented in the code $\texttt{POMPOM}$ in $\texttt{Mathematica}$ as well as in $\texttt{Python}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiquark nuggets are hypothetical compact composite objects conjectured to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the Universe. In contrast to quark nuggets, these objects consist of antimatter. They may remain undetected if they possess a sufficiently small cross section relative to their mass. In this paper, we investigate the allowed region in the parameter space of this model that is consistent with the observed neutrino flux from the Sun and the Earth, and the non-observation of seismic events with specific signatures of dark matter particles. We found the allowed values of the antibaryon charge number in this model to be in the interval $2\times 10^{24}&lt;A&lt;8\times 10^{25}$, while the probability of nucleon annihilation upon collisions with the antiquark core is constrained by $0.1\lesssim \kappa&lt;0.25$. Although very large values of the antibaryon charge, $A&gt;10^{33}$, are not fully excluded by the present study, we show that they conflict with the non-observation of rare catastrophic explosion-like events on the Earth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central nucleus--nucleus as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>

      <title>Neutron Tagging Can Greatly Reduce Spallation Backgrounds in Super-Kamiokande</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande's spallation backgrounds - the delayed beta decays of nuclides following cosmic-ray muons - are nearly all produced by the small fraction of muons with hadronic showers. We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Describing Hadronization via Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for extracting a fragmentation model directly from experimental data without requiring an explicit parametric form, called Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting (HOMER), consisting of three steps: the training of a classifier between simulation and data, the inference of single fragmentation weights, and the calculation of the weight for the full hadronization chain. We illustrate the use of HOMER on a simplified hadronization problem, a $q\bar{q}$ string fragmenting into pions, and extract a modified Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$. We then demonstrate the use of HOMER on three types of experimental data: (i) binned distributions of high level observables, (ii) unbinned event-by-event distributions of these observables, and (iii) full particle cloud information. After demonstrating that $f(z)$ can be extracted from data (the inverse of hadronization), we also show that, at least in this limited setup, the fidelity of the extracted $f(z)$ suffers only limited loss when moving from (i) to (ii) to (iii).

      <description>arXiv:2501.00678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.</description>

Abstract: The Landau states of electrons with orbital angular momentum in magnetic fields are important in the quantum theories of metals and of synchrotron radiation at storage rings, in relativistic astrophysics of neutron stars, and in many other areas. In realistic scenarios, electrons are often born inside the field or injected from a field-free region, requiring nonstationary quantum states to account for boundary or initial conditions. This study presents nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) states in a longitudinal magnetic field, characterizing vortex electrons after their transfer from vacuum to the field. Comparisons with Landau states and calculations of observables such as mean energy and r.m.s. radius show that the r.m.s. radius of the electron packet in the NSLG state oscillates in time around a significantly larger value than that of the Landau state. This quantum effect of oscillations is due to boundary conditions and can potentially be observed in various problems, particularly when using magnetic lenses of electron microscopes and linear accelerators. Analogies are drawn between a quantum wave packet and a classical beam of many particles in phase space, including the calculation of mean emittance of the NSLG state as a measure of their quantum nature.</description>

      <title>A Calabi-Yau-to-Curve Correspondence for Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the maximal cut of the equal-mass four-loop banana integral is a period of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds that depends on the kinematic variable $z=m^2/p^2$. We show that it can also be interpreted as a period of a family of genus-two curves. We do this by introducing a general Calabi-Yau-to-curve correspondence, which in this case locally relates the original period of the family of Calabi-Yau threefolds to a period of a family of genus-two curves that varies holomorphically with the kinematic variable $z$. In addition to working out the concrete details of this correspondence for the equal-mass four-loop banana integral, we outline when we expect a correspondence of this type to hold.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition in dynamical 3-flavor QCD at imaginary isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit QCD with three mass-degenerate quark flavors at an imaginary isospin chemical potential set to 4 pi T/3. This choice corresponds to a special point in the parameter space, where the theory possesses an exact Z(3) center symmetry. Through a finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate that in this case the finite temperature QCD transition is of first order and entails singular behavior both in the Polyakov loop and in the quark condensate. Our results are based on simulations with stout-smeared staggered quarks and a dedicated multi-histogram analysis.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>
