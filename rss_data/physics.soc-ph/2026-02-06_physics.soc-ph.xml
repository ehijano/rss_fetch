      <title>Is Innovation Becoming Less Disruptive? An Inventory of the Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing literature has examined whether innovation is becoming less disruptive, spanning diverse domains and data sources and using a range of methodologies. This paper provides an inventory of 105 studies exploring this question. The evidence is largely consistent in direction. Studies spanning scientific papers, patents, products, legal cases, music, and visual art consistently report evidence of a decline. This pattern holds not only for citation-based measures, but also for text-based approaches, firm displacement rates, product similarity networks, and audio and visual embeddings. The literature has also identified notable exceptions, including rebounds in specific domains and predictable variation across field lifecycles. We catalog each study's data, methods, and findings to provide a resource for researchers and policymakers seeking to understand the current state of the evidence.</description>

      <title>Modelling Pedestrian Behaviour in Autonomous Vehicle Encounters Using Naturalistic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how pedestrians adjust their movement when interacting with autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for improving safety in mixed traffic. This study examines micro-level pedestrian behaviour during midblock encounters in the NuScenes dataset using a hybrid discrete choice-machine learning framework based on the Residual Logit (ResLogit) model. The model incorporates temporal, spatial, kinematic, and perceptual indicators. These include relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and directional collision risk proximity (CRP) measures. Results suggest that some of these variables may meaningfully influence movement adjustments, although predictive performance remains moderate. Marginal effects and elasticities indicate strong directional asymmetries in risk perception, with frontal and rear CRP showing opposite influences. The remaining distance exhibits a possible mid-crossing threshold. Relative speed cues appear to have a comparatively less effect. These patterns may reflect multiple behavioural tendencies driven by both risk perception and movement efficiency.</description>

      <title>Higher-order adaptive behaviors outperform pairwise strategies in mitigating contagion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When exposed to a contagion phenomenon, individuals may respond to the perceived risk of infection by adopting behavioral changes, aiming to reduce their exposure or their risk of infecting others. The social cost of such adaptive behaviors and their impact on the contagion dynamics have been investigated in pairwise networks, with binary interactions driving both contagion and risk perception. However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes. By numerical simulations and a mean-field analytic approach, we show that adaptive behaviors driven by higher-order information are more effective in limiting the spread of a contagion, than similar mechanisms based on pairwise information. Meanwhile, they also entail a lower social cost, measured as the reduction of the intensity of interactions in the population. Indeed, adaptive mechanisms based on higher-order information lead to a heterogeneous risk perception within the population, producing a higher alert on nodes with large hyperdegree (i.e., participating in many groups), on their neighborhoods, and on large groups. This in turn prevents the spreading process to exploit the properties of these nodes and groups, which tend to drive and sustain the dynamics in the absence of adaptive behaviors.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia and Grokipedia: A Comparison of Human and Generative Encyclopedias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia to examine how generative mediation alters content selection, textual rewriting, narrative structure, and evaluative framing in encyclopedic content. We model page inclusion in Grokipedia as a function of Wikipedia page popularity, density of reference, and recent editorial activity. Inclusion is non-uniform: pages with higher visibility and greater editorial conflict in Wikipedia are more likely to appear in Grokipedia. For included pages, we distinguish between verbatim reproduction and generative rewriting. Rewriting is more frequent for pages with higher reference density and recent controversy, while highly popular pages are more often reproduced without modification. We compare editing activity across the two platforms and estimate page complexity using a fitness-complexity framework to assess whether generative mediation alters patterns of editorial participation. To assess narrative organization, we construct actor-relation networks from article texts using abstract meaning representation. Across multiple topical domains, including U.S. politics, geopolitics, and conspiracy-related narratives, narrative structure remains largely consistent between the two sources. Analysis of lead sections shows broadly correlated framing, with localized shifts in laudatory and conflict-oriented language for some topics in Grokipedia. Overall, generative systems preserve the main structural organization of encyclopedic content, while affecting how content is selected, rewritten, and framed.</description>

      <title>An FWCI decomposition of Science Foundation Ireland funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the 2008 global financial crisis, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), now Research Ireland, pivoted to research with potential socioeconomic impact. Given that the latter can encompass higher technology readiness levels, which typically correlates with lower academic impact, it is interesting to understand how academic impact holds up in SFI funded research. Here we decompose SFI \textit{Investigator Awards} - arguably the most academic funding call - into $3,243$ constituent publications and field weighted citation impact (FWCI) values searchable in the SCOPUS database. Given that citation counts are skewed, we highlight the limitation of FWCI as a paper metric, which naively restricts one to comparisons of average FWCI ($\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$) in large samples. Neglecting publications with $\textrm{FWCI} &lt; 0.1$ ($8.8\%$), SFI funded publications are well approximated by a lognormal distribution with $\mu = -0.0761^{+0.017}_{-0.0039}$ and $ \sigma = 0.933^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ at $95 \%$ confidence level. This equates to an $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}} = 1.433^{+0.029}_{-0.015}$ well above $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}=1$ internationally. Broken down by award, we correct $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$ for small samples using simulations and find $\sim 67\%$ exceed \textit{median} international academic interest, thus exhibiting a positive correlation between the potential for socioeconomic impact and academic interest.</description>

      <title>Measuring the dynamical evolution of the United States lobbying network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lobbying networks constitute complex political systems that mobilize vast human and financial resources to influence governmental decision-making, often with profound national and global consequences. A comprehensive understanding of lobbying strategies and dynamics requires time-resolved, system-wide data, which are largely unavailable for most political systems. In the United States (U.S.), the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 mandates public reporting of all federal lobbying activities in detailed quarterly filings. However, extracting structured, quantitative information from these filings has remained technically challenging and labor-intensive. Here we present and analyze LobbyView, a relational database that integrates and disambiguates data from more than 1.6 million LDA reports. LobbyView provides access to detailed lobbying disclosures, reconciled corporate entities, and tools for linking LDA data to external legislative and corporate databases. We demonstrate the utility of LobbyView by examining both macro-level and highly granular lobbying dynamics. Specifically, we reconstruct the connectivity patterns of the U.S. lobbying network, and we show how they evolve over time, we identify organizational principles such as the accumulation of professional contacts within a small set of firms, and reveal how lobbying activity is synchronized with electoral cycles. Moreover, we introduce a probabilistic framework for analyzing lobbying behavior at the scale of individual bills, issues, or firms. We envision LobbyView as a resource not only for political scientists, but also for quantitative interdisciplinary research, enabling the application of methods from statistical physics, systems biology, and machine learning to the study of lobbying systems.</description>

      <title>Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</description>

      <title>On the design of a profession-oriented course on Theoretical Mechanics for physics education students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a profession-oriented course we offered at the University of Vienna, aimed at physics education teacher students. The course on Theoretical Classical Mechanics has been conceived and designed from its outset with the explicit goal of bridging the gap between the abstract, mathematical notions employed in Theoretical Physics with the concrete future needs of prospective teachers in their profession. We aimed at countering both the negative attitudes of students towards Theoretical Physics and the interrelated skepticism of professors regarding the students mathematical proficiency. Our main findings are that these goals can indeed be achieved through a careful selection of course material and the associated mathematical tools, by closely interwoven lecture topics and exercises, and thorough planning according to principles for high-school teaching known from science education research. Establishing close connections between the material taught in the course and the students future occupation as high-school teachers has proven to be of utmost importance. This is possible without any sacrifice of mathematical rigor or of the quality of Physics presented.</description>

      <title>Link Fraction Mixed Membership Reveals Community Diversity in Aggregated Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a critical tool for understanding the mesoscopic structure of large-scale networks. However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detect communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves community membership sums at different scales. The method is utilized to study a population-scale social network of the Netherlands, aggregated at different resolutions. Experiments reveal variation in community membership across different geographical regions and evolution over the last decade. In particular, we show how our method identifies large urban hubs that act as the melting pots of diverse, spatially remote communities.</description>
