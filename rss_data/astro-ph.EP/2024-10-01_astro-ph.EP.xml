      <title>A search for water vapor plumes on Europa by spatially resolved spectroscopic observation using Subaru/IRCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of Europa using the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) onboard the Subaru Telescope, seeking direct evidence of water plumes on Europa and exploring spatial variations in plume activity. Using high spectral/spatial resolution and sensitivity of Subaru/IRCS, our observations have enabled a spatially resolved search for water plumes on Europa. Within our detection limits and time of observation, we found no evidence for the presence of water emission. For a rotation temperature of 50 K, we derived an upper limit on the H$_{2}$O abundance of 9.46$\times$10$^{19}$ - 5.92$\times$10$^{20}$ m$^{-2}$ in each divided slit area and 4.61$\times$10$^{19}$ m$^{-2}$ in the entire area covered by the slit. This upper limit lies below the inferred water abundance from previous UV observations by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), while being less sensitive by a factor of three compared to the Keck telescope and by one order of magnitude or more than the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Our results align with previous studies and demonstrate that using Subaru/IRCS is an effective strategy for searching for water plumes on Europa with high spatial resolution. Continued observations across different surface areas and orbital phases are essential to fully characterize Europa's plume activity and complement upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>The origin of free-floating objects in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky way Galaxy is brimming with free-floating objects, including stars, planets and planetesimals. For the purpose of this chapter, we define a free-floating object as a solid body that is not orbited by a considerably more massive body. A planet then is considered free floating if it is not orbiting a star but it may be orbiting another planet. A binary planet, or planet-moon pair that is not orbiting a star, is then considered free floating.
  Most free-floating objects are not born as such because most objects form in some sort of coordinated environmental effort, such as a star forming region or a circum-stellar disk. Free-floating stars then originate from dissolved clusters. Free floating planets are ejected from their parent star in an internal dynamical encounter with another planet or stripped from the star by other means such as a supernova or a nearby passing star. Free floating (interstellar) planetesimals probably form in a similar fashion as free-floating planets.
  The number of free-floating objects in the Galaxy can be large. With billions of stars and planets, and trillions of interstellar planetesimals. Although free-floating planets appear to be quite common (a few hundred have been observed), only two interstellar planetesimals have been discovered so far. The expectation, however, is that they outnumber the stars in the Galaxy by a considerable margin. We expect them to be found more frequently once large new instruments come online, such as the Vera Cooper Rubin Observatory.</description>

Abstract: We present HZ_evolution, a Python package to characterize the habitable histories of exoplanets. Given inputs of a planet's current effective flux and host star properties, HZ_evolution calculates its instellation history, the evolution of the star's Habitable Zone, and the duration the planet spends inside or outside the Habitable Zone.</description>

      <title>Promise and Peril: Stellar Contamination and Strict Limits on the Atmosphere Composition of TRAPPIST-1c from JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19333v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to probe the atmospheres of rocky planets around M dwarfs present both promise and peril. While their favorable planet-to-star radius ratios enable searches for even thin secondary atmospheres, their high activity levels and high-energy outputs threaten atmosphere survival. Here, we present the 0.6--2.85$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 1.1 Earth-radius, ~340K rocky planet TRAPPIST-1c obtained over two JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observations. Each of the two spectra displays 100--500 ppm signatures of stellar contamination. Despite being separated by 367 days, the retrieved spot and faculae properties are consistent between the two visits, resulting in nearly identical transmission spectra. Jointly retrieving for stellar contamination and a planetary atmosphere rules out with high confidence (&gt;3-$\sigma$) not only clear hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, but even thin, 1-bar high-mean molecular weight atmospheres rich in H$_2$O, NH$_3$, or CO (at the 2-$\sigma$ level). We find that the only atmosphere scenarios which our spectrum cannot rule out are CH$_4$- or CO$_2$-rich atmospheres, which are both unlikely to be retained when considering the photodestruction of CH$_4$ and the susceptibility of even a CO$_2$-rich atmosphere to escape given the cumulative high-energy irradiation experienced by the planet. Our results further stress the importance of robustly accounting for stellar contamination when analyzing JWST observations of exo-Earths around M dwarfs, as well as the need for high-fidelity stellar models to search for the potential signals of thin secondary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LIX. High-temperature line list for N$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New hot line lists for five isotopologues of N$_2$O are presented, for the parent $^{14}$N$_2^{16}$O and 4 singly substituted species $^{14}$N$_2^{17}$O, $^{14}$N$_2^{18}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$N$^{16}$O and $^{15}$N$^{14}$N$^{16}$O. The line lists have been computed with the variational program TROVE using a new empirical potential energy surface (PES) and an accurate ab initio dipole moment surface of N$_2$O Ames-1. The PES was obtained by fitting to experimentally derived energies of N$_2$O compiled using the well established MARVEL procedure. Here we also introduce an `artificial symmetry group' $C_{\rm ns}$(AEM) for an efficient construction of rotation-vibrational basis set of a linear non-symmetric triatomic molecule of the XYZ type. The line lists cover the rotational excitations up to $J=160$ and the wavenumber range up to 20000 cm$^{-1}$. MARVEL energies are also used to improve predicted line positions resulting in excellent agreement with the available experimental spectra, as demonstrated. An extensive comparison with existing line lists for N$_2$O HITRAN, HITEMP, NOSL-296, NOSD-1000 and Ames-296K is provided. The line lists are freely accessible from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Perspectives and challenges in bolide infrasound processing and interpretation: A focused review with case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing plays a critical role in the detection and analysis of bolides, offering passive, cost-effective global monitoring capabilities. Key objectives include determining the timing, location, and yield of these events. Achieving these goals requires a robust approach to detect, analyze, and interpret rapidly moving elevated sources such as bolides (also re-entry and space debris). In light of advancements in infrasonic methodologies, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of the characteristics that distinguish bolides from other infrasound sources, and methodologies for bolide infrasound analysis. This paper provides a focused review of key considerations and presents a unified framework to enhance infrasound processing approaches specifically tailored for bolides. Three representative case studies are presented to demonstrate the practical application of infrasound processing methodologies and deriving source parameters, while exploring challenges associated with bolide-generated infrasound. These case studies underscore the effectiveness of infrasound in determining source parameters and highlight interpretative challenges, such as variations in signal period measurements across different studies. Future research should place emphasis on improving geolocation and yield accuracy. This can be achieved through rigorous and systematic analyses of large, statistically significant samples of such events. aiming to resolve interpretative inconsistencies and explore the causes for variability in signal periods and back azimuths. The topic described here is also relevant to space exploration involving planetary bodies with atmospheres, such as Venus, Mars, and Titan.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Earth Magnetosphere Science Orbit via Earth-Moon Resonance Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates long-term orbits within the Earth's magnetosphere, specifically focusing on orbits where the argument of periapsis is synchronized with changes induced by lunar gravity assists and the Earth's argument of latitude over a complete orbital period in Earth-Moon resonance. In the Earth-Moon rotating frame, resonance orbits appear repetitive; however, the argument of periapsis shifts due to the third-body effects from lunar flybys. The extent of this shift is influenced by the Jacobi integral associated with the resonance orbit. To identify feasible resonance orbits and the optimal Jacobi integral, we map the argument of periapsis change against the Jacobi integral for each prospective orbit. This synchronization allows the spacecraft to remain within a confined region in space when observed from the Sun-Earth rotating frame. Finally, the article discusses the applications of these long-term Earth magnetosphere science orbits, including orbit-orientation reconfiguration (station keeping) and stability.</description>

      <title>2019 UO$_{14}$: A Transient Trojan of Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn has long been the only giant planet in our solar system without any known Trojan members. In this paper, with serendipitous archival observations and refined orbit determination, we report that 2019 UO$_{14}$ is a Trojan of the gas giant. However, the object is only a transient Trojan currently librating around the leading Lagrange point $L_4$ of the Sun-Saturn system in a period of $\sim\!0.7$ kyr. Our N-body numerical simulation shows that 2019 UO$_{14}$ was likely captured as a Centaur and became trapped around $L_4$ $\sim\!2$ kyr ago from a horseshoe coorbital. The current Trojan state will be maintained for another millennium or thereabouts before transitioning back to a horseshoe state. Additionally, we characterize the physical properties of 2019 UO$_{14}$. Assuming a linear phase slope of $0.06 \pm 0.01$ mag/deg, the mean $r$-band absolute magnitude of the object was determined to be $H_r = 13.11 \pm 0.07$, with its color measured to be consistent with those of Jupiter and Neptune Trojans and not statistically different from Centaurs. Although the short-lived Saturn Trojan exhibited no compelling evidence of activity in the observations, we favour the possibility that it could be an active Trojan. If confirmed, 2019 UO$_{14}$ would be marked as the first active Trojan in our solar system. We conservatively determine the optical depth of dust within our photometric aperture to be $\lesssim\!10^{-7}$, corresponding to a dust mass-loss rate to be $\lesssim\!1$ kg s$^{-1}$, provided that the physical properties of dust grains resemble Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1.</description>

      <title>Redshifted Sodium Transient near Exoplanet Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral sodium (Na I) is an alkali metal with a favorable absorption cross section such that tenuous gases are easily illuminated at select transiting exoplanet systems. We examine both the time-averaged and time-series alkali spectral flux individually, over 4 nights at a hot Saturn system on a $\sim$ 2.8 day orbit about a Sun-like star WASP-49 A. Very Large Telescope/ESPRESSO observations are analyzed, providing new constraints. We recover the previously confirmed residual sodium flux uniquely when averaged, whereas night-to-night Na I varies by more than an order of magnitude. On HARPS/3.6-m Epoch II, we report a Doppler redshift at $v_{ \Gamma, \mathrm{NaD}} =$ +9.7 $\pm$ 1.6 km/s with respect to the planet's rest frame. Upon examining the lightcurves, we confirm night-to-night variability, on the order of $\sim$ 1-4 % in NaD rarely coinciding with exoplanet transit, not readily explained by stellar activity, starspots, tellurics, or the interstellar medium. Coincident with the $\sim$+10 km/s Doppler redshift, we detect a transient sodium absorption event dF$_{\mathrm{NaD}}$/F$_{\star}$ = 3.6 $\pm$ 1 % at a relative difference of $\Delta F_{\mathrm{NaD}} (t) \sim$ 4.4 $\pm$ 1 %, enduring $\Delta t_{\mathrm{NaD}} \gtrsim$ 40 minutes. Since exoplanetary alkali signatures are blueshifted due to the natural vector of radiation pressure, estimated here at roughly $\sim$ -5.7 km/s, the radial velocity is rather at +15.4 km/s, far larger than any known exoplanet system. Given that the redshift magnitude v$_{\Gamma}$ is in between the Roche limit and dynamically stable satellite orbits, the transient sodium may be a putative indication of a natural satellite orbiting WASP-49 A b.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging in Meteorite Craters on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteorite craters on the asteroid surface obstruct the horizontal flow of solar wind, forming a plasma wake that modulates the particle fluxes and the electrostatic environment far downstream. In this study, surface charging properties of asteroids with nontrivial terrain are simulated based on neural network and the finite element method. Key factors such as the location, size and depth-to-width ratio of craters are all considered. Under normal conditions, as the latitude of the crater increases, the potential variation at its floor during a rotation gradually becomes smoother, finally stabilizing around -3V with minor fluctuations as the crater approaches the poles. For craters with a depth-to-width ratio greater than 0.5, because of the diverging motions of electrons and the less deflected trajectories of ions, completely different charging results are observed under parallel and perpendicular solar wind incidence, the potential around the crater floor decreases and increases with the rising depth-to-width ratio, respectively. While the surface potential appears indifferent to changes in crater size, only during solar storms, the floor of large-scale craters, such as those with a diameter of 800m, perform a 9.13V decrease in potential compared to small craters of 50m. Both studies of localized plasma flow field and the surface charging phenomenon of asteroids have substantial influence on the future safe landing and exploration missions.</description>

      <title>A general machine learning model of aluminosilicate melt viscosity and its application to the surface properties of dry lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period exoplanets like K2-141 b likely have magma oceans on their dayside, which play a critical role in redistributing heat within the planet. This could lead to a warm nightside surface, measurable by the James Webb Space Telescope, offering insights into the planet's structure. Accurate models of properties like viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude, are essential for such studies.
  We present a new model for predicting molten magma viscosity, applicable in diverse scenarios, including magma oceans on lava planets. Using a database of 28,898 viscosity measurements on phospho-alumino-silicate melts, spanning superliquidus to undercooled temperatures and pressures up to 30 GPa, we trained a greybox artificial neural network, refined by a Gaussian process. This model achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE $\approx 0.4 \log_{10}$ Pa$\cdot$s) and can handle compositions from SiO$_2$ to multicomponent magmatic and industrial glasses, accounting for pressure effects up to 30 GPa for compositions such as peridotite.
  Applying this model, we calculated the viscosity of K2-141 b's magma ocean under different compositions. Phase diagram calculations suggest that the dayside is fully molten, with extreme temperatures primarily controlling viscosity. A tenuous atmosphere (0.1 bar) might exist around a 40{\deg} radius from the substellar point. At higher longitudes, atmospheric pressure drops, and by 90{\deg}, magma viscosity rapidly increases as solidification occurs. The nightside surface is likely solid, but previously estimated surface temperatures above 400 K imply a partly molten mantle, feeding geothermal flux through vertical convection.</description>

      <title>Physical Parameters and Properties of 20 Cold Brown Dwarfs in JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 T and Y dwarfs using spectroscopy from the NIRSpec CLEAR/PRISM and MIRI LRS instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. To characterize the atmospheric parameters, we utilize two atmospheric model grids: the Sonora Elf Owl and ATMO2020++. The effective temperatures derived from the two models are relatively consistent, and metallicities are both close to solar values. However, significant discrepancies are found in other parameters, particularly in surface gravity, with the values obtained from the Sonora Elf Owl models typically being about 1 dex lower than those from the ATMO2020++ models. Further comparisons using the ATMO2020 models highlight that the adiabatic convective process introduced in the ATMO2020++ models has a significant impact on the determination of surface gravity. Using the fitted effective temperatures and absolute parallaxes from the literature, we derive radii for the brown dwarfs, which range from approximately 0.8 to 1.2 $R_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. The estimated masses and ages, derived using evolutionary tracks, indicate that most brown dwarfs in our sample have masses below 30 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and are younger than 6 Gyr. Specifically, Y dwarfs have masses ranging from 2 to 20 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and ages between 0.1 and 6.7 Gyr. In addition, We discuss the determination of atmospheric parameters using only NIRSpec or MIRI spectra. Comparisons with results from the combined spectra show that the effective temperatures and surface gravities derived solely from NIRSpec spectra are largely consistent with those obtained from the combined spectra.</description>

Abstract: Meteors carry important and indispensable information about the interplanetary environment, which can be used to understand the origin and evolution of our solar system. We have developed a Multi-station Meteor Monitoring ($\rm M^3$) system that can observe almost the entire sky and detect meteors automatically, and it determines their trajectories. They are highly extensible to construct a large-scale network. Each station consists of a waterproof casing, a wide field-of-view lens with a CMOS camera, and a supporting computer. The camera has a built-in GPS module for accurately timing the meteoroid entry into the atmosphere (accurate to 1 $\mu$s), which is the most prominent characteristic compared with other existing meteor monitoring devices. We have also developed a software package that can efficiently identify and measure meteors appearing in the real-time video stream and compute the orbits of meteoroids in the solar system via multi-station observations. During the Geminid meteor shower in 2021, the M$^3$ system was tested at two stations ($\sim$55 km apart) in the suburbs of Beijing. The test results show that the astrometric accuracy is about 0.3-0.4 arcmin. About 800 meteors were detected by these two stations. A total of 473 meteors have their orbits calculated by our software, and 377 of them belong to the Geminid meteoroid stream. Our M$^3$ system will be further tested and upgraded, and it will be used to construct a large monitoring network in China in the future.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneity of Forbush decreases: the simultaneous effects of interplanetary parameters and geomagnetic activity indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forbush decreases (Fd) are transient, short-term reductions in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth's surface. When this reduction is observed at multiple locations at the same time, it is referred to as simultaneous Forbush decreases (SFd). Identifying Fd events in daily averaged Cosmic ray (CR) raw data is always tedious, but the task has gone minimal through an algorithm (automated Fd detection). We deployed an automated Fd location algorithm on daily-averaged CR data from five neutron monitor stations covering the period 1998 to 2006. We identified 80 days with the most simultaneous events. While there exists extensive research on the subject using a case study approach, the current study is statistical. Whereas most of the previous investigations employed a small sample of Fds manually selected from a single CR station, large samples of Fds, selected after disentangling the Sun's influence on CR data from multiple neutron monitors (MNs) are used. The connection between the Fds and many solar-terrestrial variables is tested. The beautiful and consistent results obtained between the space weather variables and Fds at the five NM stations call the attention of space weather researchers to the need for rigorous, detailed, and accurate cataloging of Fds. Solar cycle oscillation significantly impacts the amplitude and timing of Fds. Its influence should be removed before Fd selection.</description>

      <title>KISS: instrument description and performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) have been proven as reliable systems for astrophysical observations, especially in the millimetre range. Their compact size enables to optimally fill the focal plane, thus boosting sensitivity. The KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) instrument is a millimetre camera that consists of two KID arrays of 316 pixels each coupled to a Martin-Puplett interferometer (MPI). The addition of the MPI grants the KIDs camera the ability to provide spectral information in the 100 and 300 GHz range. In this paper we report the main properties of the KISS instrument and its observations. We also describe the calibration and data analysis procedures used. We present a complete model of the observed data including the sky signal and several identified systematics. We have developed a full photometric and spectroscopic data analysis pipeline that translates our observations into science-ready products. We show examples of the results of this pipeline on selected sources: Moon, Jupiter and Venus. We note the presence of a deficit of response with respect to expectations and laboratory measurements. The detectors noise level is consistent with values obtained during laboratory measurements, pointing to a sub-optimal coupling between the instrument and the telescope as the most probable origin for the problem. This deficit is large enough as to prevent the detection of galaxy clusters, which were KISS main scientific objective. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated the feasibility of this kind of instrument, in the prospect for other KID interferometers (such as the CONCERTO instrument). As this regard, we have developed key instrumental technologies such as optical conception, readout electronics and raw calibration procedures, as well as, adapted data analysis procedures.</description>

      <title>Statistical view of orbital circularisation with 14 000 characterised TESS eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipsing binaries are crucial for understanding stellar physics, allowing detailed studies of stellar masses, radii, and orbital dynamics. Recent space missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) have significantly expanded the catalogue of observed eclipsing binaries with uninterrupted time series photometry, providing an opportunity for large-scale ensemble studies. This study aims to analyse the statistical properties of circularisation in a large sample of intermediate-to-high mass eclipsing binaries observed by TESS. We explore the dependence of orbital circularisation on stellar properties and orbital parameters to improve our understanding of the physical processes affecting these systems. We further aim to assess the role of stellar pulsations in circularisation. We compiled a catalogue of O- to F-type stars to search for eclipsing binary signals in the TESS data. Using automated classification and data analysis methodologies, we arrive at a well-characterised sample of 14,573 eclipsing binaries. We investigate the statistical characteristics of the sample as a function of temperature, orbital period, and scaled orbital separation. The orbital circularisation was measured with statistical methods to obtain three distinct measurements of the critical period and separation in four temperature ranges. Pulsations were identified in the g- and p-mode regimes and a reduced fraction of eccentric systems was found among them. Our analysis confirmed and expanded upon previous findings that additional dissipation is needed as compared to the predictions of turbulent viscosity and non-resonant radiative damping. We speculate that pulsations may play a role in the circularisation of close binaries. Our study highlights the need for dissipative mechanisms that can produce a wide range of critical periods from a range of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparing the dynamics of Jupiter-family Comets and comet-like fireballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), which originate from the Kuiper belt and scattered disk, exhibit low-inclination and chaotic trajectories due to close encounters with Jupiter. Despite their typically short incursions into the inner solar system, a notable number of them are on Earth-crossing orbits, with fireball networks detecting many objects on ``JFC-like'' (2 &lt; TJ &lt; 3) orbits. Aims. This investigation aims to examine the orbital dynamics of JFCs and comet-like fireballs over 10,000 yr timescales, focusing on the trajectories and stability of these objects in the context of gravitational interactions within the solar system. Methods. We employed an extensive fireball dataset from the Desert Fireball Network (DFN), European Fireball Network (EFN), Fireball Recovery and InterPlanetary Observation Network (FRIPON), and Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP), alongside telescopically observed cometary ephemeris from the NASA HORIZONS database. The study integrates 646 fireball orbits with 661 JFC orbits for a comparative analysis of their orbital stability and evolution. Results. The analysis confirms frequent Jupiter encounters among most JFCs, inducing chaotic orbital behavior with limited predictability and short Lyapunov lifetimes (about 120 years), underscoring Jupiter`s significant dynamical influence. In contrast, ``JFC-like'' meteoroids detected by fireball networks largely exhibit dynamics divergent from genuine JFCs, with 79-92% on ``JFC-like'' orbits shown not to be prone to frequent Jupiter encounters; in particular, only 1-5% of all fireballs detected by the four networks exhibit dynamics similar to that of actual JFCs. In addition, 22% (16 of 72) of near-Earth JFCs are on highly stable orbits, suggesting a potential main belt origin for some of the bodies.</description>

      <title>Geophysical Observations of the 24 September 2023 OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule Re-Entry</title>

Abstract: Sample Return Capsules (SRCs) entering Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity from interplanetary space are a valuable resource for studying meteor phenomena. The 24 September 2023 arrival of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC provided an unprecedented chance for geophysical observations of a well-characterized source with known parameters, including timing and trajectory. A collaborative effort involving researchers from 16 institutions executed a carefully planned geophysical observational campaign at strategically chosen locations, deploying over 400 ground-based sensors encompassing infrasound, seismic, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and GPS technologies. Additionally, balloons equipped with infrasound sensors were launched to capture signals at higher altitudes. This campaign (the largest of its kind so far) yielded a wealth of invaluable data anticipated to fuel scientific inquiry for years to come. The success of the observational campaign is evidenced by the near-universal detection of signals across instruments, both proximal and distal. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the collective scientific effort, field deployment, and preliminary findings. The early findings have the potential to inform future space missions and terrestrial campaigns, contributing to our understanding of meteoroid interactions with planetary atmospheres. Furthermore, the dataset collected during this campaign will improve entry and propagation models as well as augment the study of atmospheric dynamics and shock phenomena generated by meteoroids and similar sources.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey II: The 12C/13C ratios of three young brown dwarfs with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>3D Radiation-Hydrodynamical Simulations of Shadows on Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadows are often observed in transition disks, which can result from obscuring by materials closer to the star, such as a misaligned inner disk. While shadows leave apparent darkened emission as observational signatures, they have significant dynamical impact on the disk. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to study shadows in transition disks and find that the temperature drop due to the shadow acts as an asymmetric driving force, leading to spirals in the cavity. These spirals have zero pattern speed following the fixed shadow. The pitch angle is given by tan$^{-1}$($c_s$/$v_\phi$) (6$^{\circ}$ if $h/r$=0.1). These spirals transport mass through the cavity efficiently, with $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$ in our simulation. Besides spirals, the cavity edge can also form vortices and flocculent streamers. When present, these features could disturb the shadow-induced spirals. By carrying out Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, we show that these features resemble those observed in near-infrared scattered light images. In the vertical direction, the vertical gravity is no longer balanced by the pressure gradient alone. Instead, an azimuthal convective acceleration term balances the gravity-pressure difference, leading to azimuthally periodic upward and downward gas motion reaching 10% of the sound speed, which can be probed by ALMA line observations.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial planet formation during giant planet formation and giant planet migration I: The first 5 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrestrial planet formation (TPF) is a difficult problem that has vexed researchers for decades. Numerical models are only partially successful at reproducing the orbital architecture of the inner planets, but have generally not considered the effect of the growth of the giant planets. I dynamically model TPF as the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are growing using GENGA. The evolution of the masses, radii and orbital elements of the gas giants are precomputed and read and interpolated within GENGA. The terrestrial planets are formed by planetesimal accretion from tens of thousands of self-gravitating planetesimals spread between 0.5 au and 8.5 au. The total mass of the inner planetesimal disc and outer disc are typically 2 and 3 Earth masses respectively, and the composition of the planetesimals changes from non-carbonaceous-like to carbonaceous-like at a prescribed distance, ranging from 2 au to 5 au. After 5 Myr of evolution approximately 10% to 25% of the mass of planetesimals in the Jupiter-Saturn region is implanted in the inner solar system, which is more than what cosmochemical models predict. The implantation initially sets up a composition gradient in the inner solar system, with the fraction of outer solar system material increasing with increasing distance to the Sun. The planetesimals that remain in the inner solar system have a mixed composition. The growth of the gas giants scatters planetesimals in their vicinity into the inner solar system, which changes the isotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. The planetesimal disc in the vicinity of the gas giants may not have been very massive, ~1 ME. The inner planetesimal disc may not have extended much farther than 2 au otherwise embryos do not grow fast enough to produce Mars analogues. This could mean that the region of the current asteroid belt never contained much mass to begin with.</description>

      <title>SNAD catalogue of M-dwarf flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the stars in the Universe are M spectral class dwarfs, which are known to be the source of bright and frequent stellar flares. In this paper, we propose new approaches to discover M-dwarf flares in ground-based photometric surveys. We employ two approaches: a modification of a traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm based on active anomaly detection. The algorithms are applied to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data release 8, which includes the data from the ZTF high-cadence survey, allowing us to reveal flares lasting from minutes to hours. We analyze over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinize 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and other types of known variable objects. The result of this analysis is the largest catalogue of ZTF flaring stars to date, representing 134 flares with amplitudes ranging from -0.2 to -4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we assign a spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves and available geometric distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate the bolometric energy. This research shows that the proposed methods combined with the ZTF's cadence strategy are suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>
