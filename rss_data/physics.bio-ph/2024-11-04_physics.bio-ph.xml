      <title>Adaptive Node Positioning in Biological Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological transport networks are highly optimized structures that ensure power-efficient distribution of fluids across various domains, including animal vasculature and plant venation. Theoretically, these networks can be described as space-embedded graphs, and rich structures that align well with observations emerge from optimizing their hydrodynamic energy dissipation. Studies on these models typically use regular grids and focus solely on edge width optimization. Here, we present a generalization of the hydrodynamic graph model which permits additional optimization of node positioning. We achieve this by defining sink regions, accounting for the energy dissipation of delivery within these areas, and optimizing by means of differentiable physics. In the context of leaf venation patterns, our method results in organic networks that adapt to irregularities of boundaries and node misalignment, as well as overall improved efficiency. We study the dependency of the emergent network structures on the capillary delivery conductivity and identify a phase transition in which the network collapses below a critical threshold. Our findings provide insights into the early formation of biological systems and the efficient construction of transport networks.</description>

      <title>Comment on Lubineau et al. (2023) 'Does word flickering improve reading? Negative evidence from four experiments using low and high frequencies'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>Molecular sorting on a fluctuating membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular sorting in biological membranes is essential for proper cellular function. It also plays a crucial role in the budding of enveloped viruses from host cells. We recently proposed that this process is driven by phase separation, where the formation and growth of sorting domains depend primarily on short-range intermolecular interactions. In addition to these, Casimir-like forces -- arising from entropic effects in fluctuating membranes and acting on longer ranges -- may also play a significant role in the molecular distillation process. Here, using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore how these forces contribute to sorting, particularly in the biologically relevant regime where short-range intermolecular interactions are weak. Our results show that Casimir-like forces enhance molecular distillation by reducing the critical radius for the formation of new sorting domains and facilitating the capture of molecules within these domains. We identify the relative rigidity of the membrane and supermolecular domains as a key parameter controlling molecular sorting efficiency, offering new insights into the physical principles underlying molecular sorting in biological systems.</description>
