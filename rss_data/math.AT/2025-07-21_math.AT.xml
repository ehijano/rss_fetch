      <title>Prismatic Steenrod operations and arithmetic duality on Brauer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze the "syntomic Steenrod algebra", which acts on the mod $p$ syntomic cohomology (also known as etale-motivic cohomology) of algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. We then apply the resulting theory to resolve the last open cases of a 1966 Conjecture of Tate, concerning the existence of a symplectic form on the Brauer groups of smooth proper surfaces over finite fields. More generally, we exhibit symplectic structure on the higher Brauer groups of even dimensional varieties over finite fields.
  Although the applications are classical, our methods rely on recent advances in perfectoid geometry and prismatic cohomology, which we employ to define a theory of "spectral syntomic cohomology" with coefficients in motivic spectra. We then organize the resulting cohomology theories into a category of "spectral prismatic $F$-gauges", generalizing the prismatic $F$-gauges of Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie, for which we establish a ``spectral Serre duality'' extending classical coherent duality. These abstract constructions are leveraged to explicitly compute the syntomic Steenrod operations.</description>

      <title>Continuous six-functor formalism on locally compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the functor sending a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the $\infty$-category of spectral sheaves $\mathrm{Shv}(X; \mathrm{Sp})$ is initial among all continuous six-functor formalisms on the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Here, continuous six-functor formalisms are those valued in dualizable presentable stable $\infty$-categories and satisfying canonical descent, profinite descent, and hyperdescent. As an application, we generalize Efimov's computation of the algebraic $K$-theory of sheaves to all localizing invariants on continuous six-functor formalisms. Our results show that localizing invariants behave analogously to compactly supported sheaf cohomology theories when evaluated on continuous six-functor formalisms on locally compact Hausdorff spaces.</description>

      <title>Borel--Serre type bordifications and Canonical Pairs for Loop groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the symmetric space of the (positive half) of a real loop group, we attach a Borel--Serre type bordification and equip it with a Hausdorff topology. The attached boundary, indexed by certain rational parabolics of the loop group, is shown to be homotopic to an affine, rational Tits building. A loop analogue of an arithmetic group is also shown to act continuously on the bordification and its quotient by this action is studied using the reduction theory of H. Garland. While the quotient is no longer compact (as in the Borel--Serre construction from finite-dimensions) we relate the non-compactness to the center of the loop group. We also introduce a notion of semi-stability for loop groups, following works of Harder--Narasimhan, Behrend, and most recently Chaudouard, and use this to describe a partition of our loop symmetric space. This partition is then related to the rational bordification and its quotient.</description>

      <title>Formal Concept Analysis and Homotopical Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis makes the fundamental observation that any complete lattice $(L, \leq)$ is determined up to isomorphism by the restriction of the relation ${\leq} \subseteq L \times L$ to the set $J(L) \times M(L)$, where $J(L)$ is the set of join-irreducible elements of $L$ and $M(L)$ is the set of meet-irreducible elements of $L$.
  For any finite lattice $L$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$, we explicitly describe this restricted relation for the lattice of transfer systems $\mathsf{Tr}(L)$ in terms of $L$ only. We apply this to give new computations of the number of transfer systems for certain finite groups, and to produce bounds on the number of transfer systems on certain families of abelian finite groups. We also provide computer code to enable other researchers' use of these techniques.</description>

      <title>On the determination of the Singer transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.07895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_k$ be the graded polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ with the degree of each generator $x_i$ being 1, where $\mathbb F_2$ denote the prime field of two elements, and let $GL_k$ be the general linear group over $\mathbb F_2$ which acts regularly on $P_k$. We study the algebraic transfer constructed by Singer using the technique of the Peterson hit problem. This transfer is a homomorphism from the homology of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A$, $\text{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$, to the subspace of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $d$. In this paper, by using the results on the Peterson hit problem we present the proof of the fact that the Singer algebraic transfer is an isomorphism for $k \leqslant 3$. We also explicitly determine the fourth Singer algebraic transfer in some degrees.</description>

      <title>Invariants of persistence modules defined by order-embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of topological data analysis is the study of discrete invariants for persistence modules, in particular when dealing with multiparameter persistence modules. In many cases, the invariants studied for these non-totally ordered posets $P$ can be obtained from restricting a given module to a subposet $X$ of $P$ that is totally ordered (or more generally, of finite representation type), and then computing the barcode (or the general direct sum decomposition) over $X$.
  We consider in this paper general order-preserving embeddings of representation-finite subposets $X$ into $P$ and study systematically the invariants obtained by decomposing the restriction of a given $P$-module $M$ to $X$ into its indecomposable summands. The restriction functor from $\mathrm{mod}\ P$ to $\mathrm{mod}\ X$ is well-studied, and it is known to be exact and admits both left and right adjoint functors, known as induction and co-induction functors. This allows us to obtain new homological insights, and also to re-interpret previous results. We use this approach also to determine bases of the image of these invariants, thus generalizing the concept of signed barcodes which is considered in the literature in relation to stability results.
  It turns out that considering only order-embeddings of one fixed poset $X$ into the poset $P$, and studying the set of all indecomposables obtained from $X$ introduces a lot of redundancy. We therefore also study iterated embeddings of several posets of increasing sizes, while limiting attention to only some indecomposables (that have not been obtained from embedding of smaller posets previously).</description>

      <title>Real Topological Hochschild Homology of Perfectoid Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine several results of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze on THH to THR. In particular, we compute THR of perfectoid rings. This will be useful for establishing motivic filtrations on real topological Hochschild and cyclic homology of quasisyntomic rings. We also establish a real refinement of the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem.</description>
