      <title>On optimal periodic dividend and capital injection strategies for general L\'evy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a version of de Finetti's dividend problem, with the bail-out contraint to keep the surplus non-negative, and where dividend payments can only be made at the arrival times of an independent Poisson process. For a general L\'evy process with positive and negative jumps, we show the optimality of a periodic-classical reflection strategy that pays the excess above a given level at each Poisson arrival time, and also reflects below at 0 in the classical sense.</description>

      <title>On Mixed Time-Changed Erlang Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-changed variant of the Erlang queue by taking the first hitting time of a mixed stable subordinator as the time-changing component. We call it the mixed time-changed Erlang queue. We derive the system of fractional differential equations that governs its state probabilities. The explicit expressions for the state probabilities of mixed time-changed Erlang queue and their Laplace transform are derived. Equivalently, it is represented in terms of phases and its mean queue length is obtained. Also, some distributional properties of the mixed time-changed Erlang queue such as the distribution of its inter-arrival times, inter-phase times, service times and busy period are derived. Later, its conditional waiting time is discussed and two plots of sample paths simulation are presented.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a random asset exchange model with probabilistic cheaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of the standard Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) game \cite{dragulescu_statistical_2000} inspired by the very recent work \cite{blom_hallmarks_2024}, where agents involving in a money exchange dynamics are classified into two distinct types which are termed as probabilistic cheaters and honest players, respectively. A probabilistic cheater has a positive probability of declaring to have no money to give to other agents in the system, resulting in a potential financial benefits from being dishonest about his/her financial status. We provide a mean-field description of the agent-based model (in terms of a coupled infinite dimensional system of nonlinear ODEs), in the large population limit where the number of players is sent to infinity, and proves convergence of the coupled mean-field system to its stationary distribution (provided by a mixture of geometric distributions). In particular, the model gives rise to a novel formulation involving a mixture of probability distributions, thereby motivating the introduction of a unusual (generalized) entropy functional tailored to the associated mean-field system.</description>

      <title>A proof of Onsager's conjecture for the stochastic 3D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations on a periodic domain, driven by an additive stochastic forcing of trace class. First, for any $\vartheta&lt;1/3$, we construct global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C_tC^{\vartheta}_x$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability. In addition, we provide a brief proof of energy conservation for $\vartheta&gt;1/3$ based on \cite{CET94}, thereby confirming the Onsager theorem for the stochastic 3D Euler equations. Second, let $0&lt;\bar{\vartheta}&lt;\bar{\beta}&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C_tC_x^{\bar{\vartheta}}$ for any given divergence-free initial condition in $C^{\bar{\beta}}_x$. Our construction relies on the convex integration method developed in the deterministic setting by \cite{Ise18}, adapting it to the stochastic context by combining stochastic analysis and pathwise analysis arguments.</description>

      <title>Stretched non-local Pearson diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a novel class of time changed Pearson diffusions, termed stretched non local Pearson diffusions, where the stochastic time change model has the Kilbas Saigo function as its Laplace transform. Moreover, we introduce a stretched variant of the Caputo fractional derivative and prove that its eigenfunction is, in fact, the Kilbas Saigo function. Furthermore, we solve fractional Cauchy problems involving the generator of the Pearson diffusion and the Fokker Planck operator, providing both analytic and stochastic solutions, which connect the newly defined process and fractional operator with the Kilbas Saigo function. We also prove that stretched non local Pearson diffusions share the same limiting distributions as their standard counterparts. Finally, we investigate fractional hyperbolic Cauchy problems for Pearson diffusions, which resemble time fractional telegraph equations, and provide both analytical and stochastic solutions. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel representation and an asymptotic formula for the Kilbas Saigo function with complex argument, which, to the best of our knowledge, are not currently available in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Nonamenable Poisson zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Poisson zoo on an infinite Cayley graph $G$, we take a probability measure $\nu$ on rooted finite connected subsets, called lattice animals, and place i.i.d. Poisson($\lambda$) copies of them at each vertex. If the expected volume of the animals w.r.t. $\nu$ is infinite, then the whole $G$ is covered for any $\lambda&gt;0$. If the second moment of the volume is finite, then it is easy to see that for small enough $\lambda$ the union of the animals has only finite clusters, while for $\lambda$ large enough there are also infinite clusters. Here we show that:
  1. If $G$ is a nonamenable free product, then for ANY $\nu$ with infinite second but finite first moment and any $\lambda&gt;0$, there will be infinite clusters, despite having arbitrarily low density.
  2. The same result holds for ANY nonamenable $G$, when the lattice animals are worms: random walk pieces of random finite length.
  It remains open if the result holds for ANY nonamenable Cayley graph with ANY lattice animal measure $\nu$ with infinite second moment.
  3. We also give a Poisson zoo example $\nu$ on $\mathbb{T}_d \times \mathbb{Z}^5$ with finite first moment and a UNIQUE infinite cluster for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness in law of stochastic 3d navierstokes equations with general multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the three dimensional navier-stokes equations driven by a general multiplicative noise. For every divergence free and mean free initial condition in L2, we establish existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions, which implies non-uniqueness in law. Moreover, we prove the existence of infinitely many ergodic stationary solutions. Our results are based on a stochastic version of the convex integration and the Ito calculus.</description>

      <title>Rough Burger-like SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$. In this paper, we extend Hairer's result by lowering the spatial regularity to the range $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{3}]$. Specifically, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this lower spatial regularity regime.</description>

      <title>On Berry Esseen type estimates for randomized Martingales in the non stationary setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider partial sums of triangular martingale differences weighted by random variables drawn uniformly on the sphere, and globally independent of the martingale differences. Starting from the so-called principle of conditioning and using some arguments developed by Klartag-Sodin and Bobkov-Chistyakov-G{\"o}tze, we give some upper bounds for the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of these weighted sums and a Normal distribution. Under some conditions on the conditional variances of the martingale differences, the obtained rates are always faster than those obtained in case of usual partial sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an inequality for the spectral norm of matrix valued stochastic integrals. This inequality can be seen either as a non-commutative version of the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality or as an extension of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality of Lust-Piquard to stochastic integrals. The proof relies on a version of Freedman's inequality for matrix valued martingales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic moments dynamics: a flexible finite-dimensional random perturbation of Wasserstein gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For optimizing a non-convex function in finite dimension, a method is to add Brownian noise to a gradient descent, allowing for transitions between basins of attractions of different minimizers. To adapt this for optimization over a space of probability distributions requires a suitable noise. For this purpose, we introduce here a simple stochastic process where a number of moments of the distribution are following a chosen finite-dimensional diffusion process, generalizing some previous studies where the expectation of the measure is subject to a Brownian noise. The process may explode in finite time, for instance when trying to force the variance of a distribution to behave like a Brownian motion. We show, up to the possible explosion time, well-posedness and propagation of chaos for the system of mean-field interacting particles with common noise approximating the process.</description>

Abstract: We consider the products $G_n = A_n \cdots A_1$ of independent and identical distributed nonnegative $d \times d$ matrices $(A_i)_{i \geq 1}$. For any starting point $x \in \mathbb{R}_+^d$ with unit norm, we establish the convergence to a stable law for the norm cocycle $\log | G_nx |$, jointly with its direction $G_n \cdot x = G_n x / | G_n x |$. We also prove a local limit theorem for the couple $ (\log |G_nx|, G_n \cdot x)$, and find the exact rate of its convergence.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of SDEs for reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction networks are widely applied across scientific disciplines to model complex dynamic systems. We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Langevin Diffusion Approximation to Same Marginal Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approximation to the same marginal Schr\"{o}dinger bridge using the Langevin diffusion. As $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, it is known that the barycentric projection (also known as the entropic Brenier map) of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge converges to the Brenier map, which is the identity. Our diffusion approximation is leveraged to show that, under suitable assumptions, the difference between the two is $\varepsilon$ times the gradient of the marginal log density (i.e., the score function), in $\mathbf{L}^2$. More generally, we show that the family of Markov operators, indexed by $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, derived from integrating test functions against the conditional density of the static Schr\"{o}dinger bridge at temperature $\varepsilon$, admits a derivative at $\varepsilon=0$ given by the generator of the Langevin semigroup. Hence, these operators satisfy an approximate semigroup property at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Markov Modelling Approach for Queues with Correlated Service Times -- the $M/M_D/2$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand for studying queueing systems with multiple servers providing correlated services was created about 60 years ago, motivated by various applications. In recent years, the importance of such studies has been significantly increased, supported by new applications of greater significance to much larger scaled industry, and the whole society. Such studies have been considered very challenging.
  In this paper, a new Markov modelling approach for queueing systems with servers providing correlated services is proposed. We apply this new proposed approach to a queueing system with arrivals according to a Poisson process and two positive correlated exponential servers, referred to as the $M/M_D/2$ queue. We first prove that the queueing process (the number of customers in the system) is a Markov chain, and then provide an analytic solution for the stationary distribution of the process, based on which it becomes much easier to see the impact of the dependence on system performance compared to the performance with independent services.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</description>

In this framework, individuals from all species are equally susceptible to infection by two distinct pathogens transmitted via person-to-person contact. We assume antagonistic mortality, where the simultaneous occurrence of coinfection reduces the probability of host mortality due to complications arising from either coexisting disease. Specifically, we explore two scenarios: global antagonism, where the presence of one pathogen inhibits the progression of the other in coinfected hosts, and uneven antagonism, where only one pathogen affects the development of the other. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the characteristic length scale of the spatial patterns emerging from random initial conditions diminishes as antagonism becomes more significant. We find that antagonism enhances species population growth and reduces the average probability of healthy organisms becoming infected. Additionally, introducing individuals' mobility restrictions significantly decreases both organisms' infection risk and selection pressures. Our results demonstrate that combining mobility restrictions with antagonistic coinfection can increase organisms' life expectancy by up to $54\%$. Our findings show that integrating antagonistic coinfection and mobility restriction strategies into ecological models may provide insights into designing interventions for managing concurrent epidemics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling" problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently encountered in Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Some Observations about the "Generalized Abundancy Index"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}(\ell,n) \subset S_n^{\ell}$ denote the set of all $\ell$-tuples $(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$, for $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \in S_n$ satisfying: $\forall i&lt;j$ we have $\pi_i\pi_j=\pi_j\pi_i$. Considering the action of $S_n$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $\kappa(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$ be equal to the number of orbits of the action of the subgroup $\langle \pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \rangle \subset S_n$. There has been interest in the study of the combinatorial numbers $A(\ell,n,k)$ equal to the cardinalities $|\{(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell}) \in \mathcal{A}(\ell,n)\, :\, \kappa(\pi_1,\dots\pi_{\ell})=k\}|$. If one defines $B(\ell,n)=A(\ell,n,1)/(n-1)!$, then it is known that $B(\ell,n) = \sum_{(f_1,\dots,f_{\ell}) \in \mathbb{N}^{\ell}} \mathbf{1}_{\{n\}}(f_1\cdots f_{\ell}) \prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1} f_r^{\ell-r}$. A special case, $\ell=2$, is $B(2,n) = \sum_{d|n} d = \sigma_1(n)$ the sum-of-divisors function. Then $A(2,n,1)/n!=B(2,n)/n$ is called the abundancy index: $\sigma_1(n)/n$. We call $B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ the ``generalized abundancy index.'' Building on work of Abdesselam, using the probability model, we prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ equals $\zeta(2)\cdots \zeta(\ell)$. Motivated by this we state a more precise conjecture for the asymptotics of $-\zeta(2) + N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} (B(2,n)/n)$.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak quantitative estimates in slow-fast diffusions using filtering techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of slow-fast diffusions as the separation of scale diverges is a well-studied problem in the literature. In this short paper, we revisit this problem and obtain a new shorter proof of existing strong quantitative convergence estimates (in particular, $L^2$ estimates) and weak convergence estimates in terms of $n$ (the parameter associated with the separation of scales). In particular, we obtain the rate of $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ in the strong convergence estimates and the rate of $n^{-1}$ for weak convergence estimate which are already known to be optimal in the literature. We achieve this using nonlinear filtering theory where we represent the evolution of faster diffusion in terms of its conditional distribution given the slower diffusion. We then use the well-known Kushner-Stratanovich equation which gives the evolution of the conditional distribution of the fast diffusion given the slow diffusion and establish that this conditional distribution approaches the invariant measure of the ``frozen" diffusion (obtained by freezing the slow variable in the evolution equation of the fast diffusion). At the heart of the analysis lies a key estimate of a weighted total variation distance between a generic measure and the unique invariant measure (of the ``frozen" diffusion). This estimate is in terms of the operator norm of the dual of the infinitesimal generator of the ``frozen" diffusion.</description>

      <title>Property FA for random $\ell$-gonal groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the binomial $\ell$-gonal model for random groups, where the random relations all have fixed length $\ell\geq 3$ and the number of generators goes to infinity, we establish a double threshold near density $d=\frac{1}{\ell}$ where the group goes from being free to having Serre's property FA.
  As a consequence, random $\ell$-gonal groups at densities $\frac{1}{\ell} &lt; d&lt; \frac{1}{2}$ have boundaries homeomorphic to the Menger sponge, and $\frac{1}{\ell}$ is also the threshold for finiteness of $\mathrm{Out}(G)$. We also see that the thresholds for property FA and Kazhdan's property (T) differ when $\ell \geq 4$.
  Our methods are inspired by work of Antoniuk-Luczak-\'Swi\k{a}tkowski and Dahmani-Guirardel-Przytycki.</description>

      <title>Improved Mixing of Critical Hardcore Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hardcore model is one of the most classic and widely studied examples of undirected graphical models. Given a graph $G$, the hardcore model describes a Gibbs distribution of $\lambda$-weighted independent sets of $G$. In the last two decades, a beautiful computational phase transition has been established at a precise threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta)$ where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree, where the task of sampling independent sets transfers from polynomial-time solvable to computationally intractable. We study the critical hardcore model where $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$ and show that the Glauber dynamics, a simple yet popular Markov chain algorithm, mixes in $\tilde{O}(n^{7.44 + O(1/\Delta)})$ time on any $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta\geq3$, significantly improving the previous upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{12.88+O(1/\Delta)})$ by the recent work arXiv:2411.03413. The core property we establish in this work is that the critical hardcore model is $O(\sqrt{n})$-spectrally independent, improving the trivial bound of $n$ and matching the critical behavior of the Ising model. Our proof approach utilizes an online decision-making framework to study a site percolation model on the infinite $(\Delta-1)$-ary tree, which can be interesting by itself.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Time-Averaged Mean Field Gradient Descent Dynamics for Continuous Multi-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>Singular Control in Inventory Management with Smooth Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider singular control in inventory management under Knightian uncertainty, where decision makers have a smooth ambiguity preference over Gaussian-generated priors. We demonstrate that continuous-time smooth ambiguity is the infinitesimal limit of Kalman-Bucy filtering with recursive robust utility. Additionally, we prove that the cost function can be determined by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth. With a sufficient condition and utilising variational inequalities in a viscosity sense, we derive the value function and optimal control policy. By the change-of-coordinate technique, we transform the problem into two-dimensional singular control, offering insights into model learning and aligning with classical singular control free boundary problems. We numerically implement our theory using a Markov chain approximation, where inventory is modeled as cash management following an arithmetic Brownian motion. Our numerical results indicate that the continuation region can be divided into three key areas: (i) the target region; (ii) the region where it is optimal to learn and do nothing; and (iii) the region where control becomes predominant and learning should inactive. We demonstrate that ambiguity drives the decision maker to act earlier, leading to a smaller continuation region. This effect becomes more pronounced at the target region as the decision maker gains confidence from a longer learning period. However, these dynamics do not extend to the third region, where learning is excluded.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a study of large deviations for block model random graphs in the dense regime. Following Chatterjee-Varadhan(2011), we establish an LDP for dense block models, viewed as random graphons. As an application of our result, we study upper tail large deviations for homomorphism densities of regular graphs. We identify the existence of a "symmetric" phase, where the graph, conditioned on the rare event, looks like a block model with the same block sizes as the generating graphon. In specific examples, we also identify the existence of a "symmetry breaking" regime, where the conditional structure is not a block model with compatible dimensions. This identifies a "reentrant phase transition" phenomenon for this problem -- analogous to one established for Erdos-Renyi random graphs (Chatterjee-Dey(2010), Chatterjee-Varadhan(2011)). Finally, extending the analysis of Lubetzky-Zhao(2015), we identify the precise boundary between the symmetry and symmetry breaking regime for homomorphism densities of regular graphs and the operator norm on Erdos-Renyi bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the empirical distribution along a geodesic in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In first-passage percolation, we assign i.i.d.~nonnegative weights $(t_e)$ to the nearest-neighbor edges of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and study the induced pseudometric $T = T(x,y)$. In this paper, we focus on geodesics, or optimal paths for $T$, and estimate the empirical distribution of weights along them. We prove an upper bound for the expected number of edges with weight $\geq M$ in the union of all geodesics from $0$ to $x$ of the form $q(M) \mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M)|x|$, where $q(M) \leq e^{-cM}$. This shows that the tail of the expected empirical distribution along a geodesic is lighter than that of the original weight distribution by an exponential factor. We also give a lower bound for the expected minimal number of edges with weight $\geq M$ in any geodesic from $0$ to $x$ in terms of $\mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M)$ and $\mathbb{P}(t_e \in [M,2M])$. For example, these two imply that if $t_e$ has a power law tail of the form $\mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M) \sim M^{-\alpha}$, then the tail of the expected empirical distribution asymptotically lies between $e^{-CM \log M}$ and $e^{-cM}$. We also provide estimates for the expected number of edges in a geodesic with weight in a set $A$ for (a) arbitrary $A$, (b) $A$ an interval separated from the infimum of the support of $t_e$ and (c) $A=[0,a]$ for some $a \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Multiple points on the boundaries of Brownian loop-soup clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Brownian loop soup with intensity $c\in(0,1]$ in the unit disk, we show that almost surely, the set of simple (resp. double) points on any portion of boundary of any of its clusters has Hausdorff dimension $2-\xi_c(2)$ (resp. $2-\xi_c(4)$), where $\xi_c(k)$ is the generalized disconnection exponent computed in arxiv:1901.05436. As a consequence, when the dimension is positive, such points are a.s. dense on every boundary of every cluster. There are a.s. no triple points on the cluster boundaries.
  As an intermediate result, we establish a separation lemma for Brownian loop soups, which is a powerful tool for obtaining sharp estimates on non-intersection and non-disconnection probabilities in the setting of loop soups. In particular, it allows us to define a family of generalized intersection exponents $\xi_c(k, \lambda)$, and show that $\xi_c(k)$ is the limit as $\lambda\searrow 0$ of $\xi_c(k, \lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of slow-fast systems driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a multiscale system of stochastic differential equations in which the slow component is perturbed by a small fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&gt;1/2$ and the fast component is driven by an independent Brownian motion. Working in the framework of Young integration, we use tools from fractional calculus and weak convergence arguments to establish a Large Deviation Principle in the homogenized limit, as the noise intensity and time-scale separation parameters vanish at an appropriate rate. Our approach is based in the study of the limiting behavior of an associated controlled system. We show that, in certain cases, the non-local rate function admits an explicit non-variational form. The latter allows us to draw comparisons to the case $H=1/2$ which corresponds to the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. Moreover, we study the asymptotics of the rate function as $H\rightarrow{1/2}^+$ and show that it is discontinuous at $H=1/2.$</description>

      <title>Triangle processes on graphs with given degree sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The switch chain is a well-studied Markov chain which generates random graphs with a given degree sequence and has uniform stationary distribution. Motivated by the high number of triangles seen in some real-world networks, we study a variant of the switch chain which is more likely to produce graphs with higher numbers of triangles. Specifically, we apply a Metropolis scheme designed to have the following stationary distribution: graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{\min\{t(G),\nu\}}$, where $t(G)$ is the number of triangles in $G$ and $\nu$ is a cut-off value introduced to moderate the impact of graphs with a very high number of triangles. We assume that the ``activity'' $\lambda$ satisfies $\lambda\geq 1$, and call the resulting chain the modified Metropolis switch chain. We prove that the modified Metropolis switch chain is rapidly mixing whenever the (standard) switch chain is rapidly mixing, provided that the activity and maximum degree are not too large.
  The triangle switch (or ``$\triangle$-switch'') chain is a restriction of the switch chain which only performs switches that change the set of triangles in the graph. We prove that the $\triangle$-switch chain is irreducible for any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 3, and prove a rapid mixing result for the modified Metropolis $\triangle$-switch chain.
  Finally, we investigate the distribution of triangles in random graphs with given degrees, under both the uniform distribution and the distribution in which graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{t(G)}$. Our analysis implies that the imposition of the cut-off $\nu$ does not significantly impact the behaviour of these modified Metropolis chains over polynomially many steps</description>

      <title>Estimation of the lifetime distribution from fluctuations in Bellman-Harris processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of a population is often modeled as branching process where each individual at the end of its life is replaced by a certain number of offspring. An example of these branching models is the Bellman-Harris process, where the lifetime of individuals is assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Here, we are interested in the estimation of the parameters of the Bellman-Harris model, motivated by the estimation of cell division time. Lifetimes are distributed according a Gamma distribution and we follow a population that starts from a small number of individuals by performing time-resolved measurements of the population size. The exponential growth of the population size at the beginning offers an easy estimation of the mean of the lifetime. Going farther and describing lifetime variability is a challenging task however, due to the complexity of the fluctuations of non-Markovian branching processes. Using fine and recent results on these fluctuations, we describe two time-asymptotic regimes and explain how to estimate the parameters. Then, we both consider simulations and biological data to validate and discuss our method. The results described here provide a method to determine single-cell parameters from time-resolved measurements of populations without the need to track each individual or to know the details of the initial condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study diffusion processes on the p-Wasserstein space $\mathscr P_p$ for $p\in [1,\infty)$ over a separable, reflexive Banach space $X$, we present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms in $L^2(\mathscr P_p,\Lambda)$ for a reference probability $\Lambda$ on $\mathscr P_p$. It is formulated in terms of an upper bound condition with the uniform norm of the intrinsic derivative. We find a versatile class of quasi-regular local Dirichlet forms on $\mathscr P_p$ by using images of Dirichlet forms on the tangent space $L^p(X\to X,\mu_0)$ at a reference point $\mu_0\in\mathscr P_p$. The Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type Dirichlet form and process on $\mathscr P_2$ are an important example in this class. We derive an $L^2$-estimate for the corresponding heat kernel and an integration by parts formula for the invariant measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cover times quantify the speed of exhaustive search. In this work, we compute exactly the mean cover time associated with a one-dimensional Brownian search under exponentially distributed resetting. We also approximate the moments of cover times of a wide range of stochastic search processes in $d$-dimensional continuous space and on an arbitrary discrete network under frequent stochastic resetting. These results hold for a large class of resetting time distributions and search processes including diffusion and Markov jump processes.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Cover Time of Tori in Dimensions $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider large deviations of the cover time of the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^d$, $d \geq 3$ by simple random walk. We prove a lower bound on the probability that the cover time is smaller than $\gamma\in (0,1)$ times its expected value, with exponents matching the upper bound from [Goodman-den Hollander, Probab. Theory Related Fields (2014)] and [Comets-Gallesco-Popov-Vachkovskaia, Electron. J. Probab. (2013)]. Moreover, we derive sharp asymptotics for $\gamma \in (\frac{d+2}{2d},1)$. The strong coupling of the random walk on the torus and random interlacements developed in a recent work [Pr\'evost-Rodriguez-Sousi, arXiv:2309.03192] serves as an important ingredient in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Iterated Poisson Processes for Catastrophic Risk Modeling in Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of the Multiply Iterated Poisson Process (MIPP), a stochastic process constructed by repeatedly time-changing a Poisson process, and its applications in ruin theory. Like standard Poisson processes, MIPPs have exponentially distributed sojourn times (waiting times between jumps). We explicitly derive the probabilities of all possible jump sizes at the first jump and obtain the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of the first jump time and its corresponding jump size. In ruin theory, the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg model assumes that claims arrive independently according to a Poisson process. In contrast, our model employs an MIPP to allow for clustered arrivals, reflecting real-world scenarios, such as catastrophic events. Under this new framework, we derive the corresponding scale function in closed form, facilitating accurate calculations of the probability of ruin in the presence of clustered claims. These results improve the modeling of extreme risks and have practical implications for insurance solvency assessments, reinsurance pricing, and capital reserve estimation.</description>

      <title>Anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations and their applications to nonzero-sum stochastic differential games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Wen, Y. Shi, Stat. Probab. Lett. 156 (2020) 108599] the authors first introduced a kind of anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (anticipated BSVIEs, for short). By virtue of the duality principle, it is found in this paper that the anticipated BSVIEs can be applied to the study of stochastic differential games. For this in this paper we deeply investigate a more general class of anticipated BSVIEs whose generator includes both pointwise time-advanced functions and average time-advanced functions. In theory, the well-posedness and the comparison theorem of anticipated BSVIEs are established, and some regularity results of adapted M-solutions are proved by applying Malliavin calculus, which cover the previous results for BSVIEs. Further, using linear ABSVIEs as the adjoint equation, we present the maximum principle for the nonzero-sum differential game system of stochastic delay Volterra integral equations (SDVIEs, for short) for the first time. As one of the applications of the theorem, a Nash equilibrium point of the linear-quadratic differential game problem of SDVIEs is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mesoscopic fluctuations at edges of orthogonal polynomial ensembles with both continuous and discrete measures. Our main result is a Central limit Theorem (CLT) for linear statistics at mesoscopic scales. We show that if the recurrence coefficients for the associated orthogonal polynomials are slowly varying, a universal CLT holds. Our primary tool is the resolvent for the truncated Jacobi matrices associated with the orthogonal polynomials. While the Combes-Thomas estimate has been successful in obtaining bulk mesoscopic fluctuations in the literature, it is too rough at the edges. Instead, we prove an estimate for the resolvent of Jacobi matrices with slowly varying entries. Particular examples to which our CLT applies are Jacobi, Laguerre and Gaussian unitary ensembles as well as discrete ensembles from random tilings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. Corresponding higher-order results are also derived in the form of higher-order correlation estimates. The approach is new and easily adaptable: we start from suboptimal correlation estimates obtained from an elementary use of It\^o's calculus on moments of the empirical measure, together with ergodic properties of the mean-field dynamics, and these bounds are then made optimal after combination with PDE estimates on the BBKY hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>

We prove that if $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ are two families whose cross intersections forbid $\ell$ -- that is, they satisfy $|A\cap B|\neq \ell$ for every $A\in\mathcal{F}$ and every $B\in\mathcal{G}$ -- then, setting $t:=\min\{\ell,pn-\ell\}$, we have the subgaussian bound \[ \mu_p(\mathcal{F})\, \mu_{p'}(\mathcal{G})\leqslant 2\exp\Big( - \frac{t^2}{58^2\,pn}\Big), \] where $\mu_p$ and $\mu_{p'}$ denote the $p$-biased and $p'$-biased measures on $\{0,1\}^n$ respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Estimates for Markov Transition Matrices with Rigorous Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for the classical Maximal Likelihood Estimation of the transition matrix of a given Markov chain. Meanwhile, in the reversible case, we propose a new reversibility-preserving online Symmetric Counting Estimation of the transition matrix with non-asymptotic deviation bounds. Our analysis is based on a convergence study of certain Markov chains on the length-2 path spaces induced by the original Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed.
  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Is Stochastic Gradient Descent Effective? A PDE Perspective on Machine Learning processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the behaviour of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a widely used method in supervised learning for optimizing neural network weights via a minimization of non-convex loss functions. Since the pioneering work of E, Li and Tai (2017), the underlying structure of such processes can be understood via parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, which are at the core of our analysis. Even if Fokker-Planck equations have a long history and a extensive literature, almost nothing is known when the potential is non-convex or when the diffusion matrix is degenerate, and this is the main difficulty that we face in our analysis.
  We identify two different regimes: in the initial phase of SGD, the loss function drives the weights to concentrate around the nearest local minimum. We refer to this phase as the drift regime and we provide quantitative estimates on this concentration phenomenon. Next, we introduce the diffusion regime, where stochastic fluctuations help the learning process to escape suboptimal local minima. We analyze the Mean Exit Time (MET) and prove upper and lower bounds of the MET. Finally, we address the asymptotic convergence of SGD, for a non-convex cost function and a degenerate diffusion matrix, that do not allow to use the standard approaches, and require new techniques. For this purpose, we exploit two different methods: duality and entropy methods.
  We provide new results about the dynamics and effectiveness of SGD, offering a deep connection between stochastic optimization and PDE theory, and some answers and insights to basic questions in the Machine Learning processes: How long does SGD take to escape from a bad minimum? Do neural network parameters converge using SGD? How do parameters evolve in the first stage of training with SGD?</description>

      <title>Definable expansions on countable groups and countable Borel equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study expansion problems on countable structures in the setting of descriptive combinatorics. We consider both expansions on countable Borel equivalence relations and on countable groups, in the Borel, measure and category settings, and establish some basic correspondences between the two notions. We also prove some general structure theorems for measure and category. We then explore in detail many examples, including finding spanning trees in graphs, finding monochromatic sets in Ramsey's Theorem, and linearizing partial orders.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</description>
