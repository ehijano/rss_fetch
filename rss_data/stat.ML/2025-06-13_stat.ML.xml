      <title>Fundamental Limits of Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in $\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance. We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2) e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3 \sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge \Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge \Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.</description>

      <title>Momentum Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g., single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies, opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.</description>

      <title>Distributionally-Constrained Adversaries in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary within learnable distribution classes.</description>

      <title>Measuring Semantic Information Production in Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions" are located at different intermediate times.</description>

      <title>Box-Constrained Softmax Function and Its Application for Post-Hoc Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities, which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax ($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets, achieving improvements in calibration metrics.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Smoothing for Adaptive PAC-Bayesian Off-Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.</description>

      <title>Practical Improvements of A/B Testing with Off-Policy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved. We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Spectral Feature Learning for Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument. Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario, weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate this taxonomy.</description>

      <title>Probably Approximately Correct Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.</description>

      <title>What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance (CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength $w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution. Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation ($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.</description>

      <title>Identifying critical residues of a protein using meaningfully-thresholded Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of 156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues, and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained with the three distinct criticality parameters, against experimentally-ascertained critical residues.</description>

      <title>Textual Bayes: Quantifying Uncertainty in LLM-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source, black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts. This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text. To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based systems.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis as Imprecise Classification with Trainable Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning Representations for Learning from Multiple Annotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However, sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data, the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks. The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and real-world crowdsourcing datasets.</description>

      <title>VQC-MLPNet: An Unconventional Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture for Scalable and Robust Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation, uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework, advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Min-Max Regret in Grouped Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets [Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret, defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups, providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over each group learning their best action independently.</description>

      <title>Air in Your Neighborhood: Fine-Grained AQI Forecasting Using Mobile Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries. While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2 neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Discovering Hierarchical Latent Capabilities of Language Models via Causal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges, including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings: specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, based on the notion of geometric mean of probability measures, in the setting of Gaussian measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. On the set of all Gaussian measures equivalent to a fixed one, we present a closed form expression for this divergence that directly generalizes the finite-dimensional version. Using the notion of Log-Determinant divergences between positive definite unitized trace class operators, we then define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence that is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and that recovers the exact Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence between two equivalent Gaussian measures when the regularization parameter tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals, precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive) error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying degrees of data availability and intersectionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey on the use of low-degree polynomials to predict and explain the apparent statistical-computational tradeoffs in a variety of average-case computational problems. In a nutshell, this framework measures the complexity of a statistical task by the minimum degree that a polynomial function must have in order to solve it. The main goals of this survey are to (1) describe the types of problems where the low-degree framework can be applied, encompassing questions of detection (hypothesis testing), recovery (estimation), and more; (2) discuss some philosophical questions surrounding the interpretation of low-degree lower bounds, and notably the extent to which they should be treated as evidence for inherent computational hardness; (3) explore the known connections between low-degree polynomials and other related approaches such as the sum-of-squares hierarchy and statistical query model; and (4) give an overview of the mathematical tools used to prove low-degree lower bounds. A list of open problems is also included.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.</description>

      <title>Learning a Gaussian Mixture for Sparsity Regularization in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverse problems, it is widely recognized that the incorporation of a sparsity prior yields a regularization effect on the solution. This approach is grounded on the a priori assumption that the unknown can be appropriately represented in a basis with a limited number of significant components, while most coefficients are close to zero. This occurrence is frequently observed in real-world scenarios, such as with piecewise smooth signals. In this study, we propose a probabilistic sparsity prior formulated as a mixture of degenerate Gaussians, capable of modeling sparsity with respect to a generic basis. Under this premise, we design a neural network that can be interpreted as the Bayes estimator for linear inverse problems. Additionally, we put forth both a supervised and an unsupervised training strategy to estimate the parameters of this network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a numerical comparison with commonly employed sparsity-promoting regularization techniques, namely LASSO, group LASSO, iterative hard thresholding, and sparse coding/dictionary learning. Notably, our reconstructions consistently exhibit lower mean square error values across all $1$D datasets utilized for the comparisons, even in cases where the datasets significantly deviate from a Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normalizing flows are a flexible class of probability distributions, expressed as transformations of a simple base distribution. A limitation of standard normalizing flows is representing distributions with heavy tails, which arise in applications to both density estimation and variational inference. A popular current solution to this problem is to use a heavy tailed base distribution. We argue this can lead to poor performance due to the difficulty of optimising neural networks, such as normalizing flows, under heavy tailed input. We propose an alternative, "tail transform flow" (TTF), which uses a Gaussian base distribution and a final transformation layer which can produce heavy tails. Experimental results show this approach outperforms current methods, especially when the target distribution has large dimension or tail weight.</description>

Abstract: Causal mediation analyses investigate the mechanisms through which causes exert their effects, and are therefore central to scientific progress. The literature on the non-parametric definition and identification of mediational effects in rigourous causal models has grown significantly in recent years, and there has been important progress to address challenges in the interpretation and identification of such effects. Despite great progress in the causal inference front, statistical methodology for non-parametric estimation has lagged behind, with few or no methods available for tackling non-parametric estimation in the presence of multiple, continuous, or high-dimensional mediators. In this paper we show that the identification formulas for six popular non-parametric approaches to mediation analysis proposed in recent years can be recovered from just two statistical estimands. We leverage this finding to propose an all-purpose one-step estimation algorithm that can be coupled with machine learning in any mediation study that uses any of these six definitions of mediation. The estimators have desirable properties, such as $\sqrt{n}$-convergence and asymptotic normality. Estimating the first-order correction for the one-step estimator requires estimation of complex density ratios on the potentially high-dimensional mediators, a challenge that is solved using recent advancements in so-called Riesz learning. We illustrate the properties of our methods in a simulation study and illustrate its use on real data to estimate the extent to which pain management practices mediate the total effect of having a chronic pain disorder on opioid use disorder.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Smoothed Online Learning without Knowledge of the Base Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical results in statistical learning typically consider two extreme data-generating models: i.i.d. instances from an unknown distribution, or fully adversarial instances, often much more challenging statistically. To bridge the gap between these models, recent work introduced the smoothed framework, in which at each iteration an adversary generates instances from a distribution constrained to have density bounded by $\sigma^{-1}$ compared to some fixed base measure $\mu$. This framework interpolates between the i.i.d. and adversarial cases, depending on the value of $\sigma$. For the classical online prediction problem, most prior results in smoothed online learning rely on the arguably strong assumption that the base measure $\mu$ is known to the learner, contrasting with standard settings in the PAC learning or consistency literature. We consider the general agnostic problem in which the base measure is unknown and values are arbitrary. Along this direction, Block et al. showed that empirical risk minimization has sublinear regret under the well-specified assumption. We propose an algorithm R-Cover based on recursive coverings which is the first to guarantee sublinear regret for agnostic smoothed online learning without prior knowledge of $\mu$. For classification, we prove that R-Cover has adaptive regret $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT/\sigma})$ for function classes with VC dimension $d$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. For regression, we establish that R-Cover has sublinear oblivious regret for function classes with polynomial fat-shattering dimension growth.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Watermarks for Large Language Models via Maximal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking language models is essential for distinguishing between human and machine-generated text and thus maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of digital communication. We present a novel green/red list watermarking approach that partitions the token set into ``green'' and ``red'' lists, subtly increasing the generation probability for green tokens. To correct token distribution bias, our method employs maximal coupling, using a uniform coin flip to decide whether to apply bias correction, with the result embedded as a pseudorandom watermark signal. Theoretical analysis confirms this approach's unbiased nature and robust detection capabilities. Experimental results show that it outperforms prior techniques by preserving text quality while maintaining high detectability, and it demonstrates resilience to targeted modifications aimed at improving text quality. This research provides a promising watermarking solution for language models, balancing effective detection with minimal impact on text quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the diffusion model as a method to generate new samples. Generative models have been recently adopted for tasks such as art generation (Stable Diffusion, Dall-E) and text generation (ChatGPT). Diffusion models in particular apply noise to sample data and then "reverse" this noising process to generate new samples. We will formally define these noising and denoising processes, then present algorithms to train and generate with a diffusion model. Afterward, we will explore a potential application of diffusion models in improving classifier performance on imbalanced data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bernstein Normalizing Flows for Flexible Multivariate Density Regression with Interpretable Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Second-order Conditional Gradient Sliding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08907v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to their local quadratic convergence. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. We present the \emph{Second-Order Conditional Gradient Sliding} (SOCGS) algorithm, which uses a projection-free algorithm to solve the constrained quadratic subproblems inexactly. When the feasible region is a polytope the algorithm converges quadratically in primal gap after a finite number of linearly convergent iterations. Once in the quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log 1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log (1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although possible, is costly.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Discretization against an Adversary: Lipschitz bandits, Dynamic Pricing, and Auction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.12367v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipschitz bandits is a prominent version of multi-armed bandits that studies large, structured action spaces such as the $[0,1]$ interval, where similar actions are guaranteed to have similar rewards. A central theme here is the adaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually ``zooms in'' on the more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of ``nicer'' problem instances, while retaining near-optimal worst-case performance. While the stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version with adversarial rewards is not.
  We provide the first algorithm (\emph{Adversarial Zooming}) for adaptive discretization in the adversarial version, and derive instance-dependent regret bounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the adversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic version.
  We apply our algorithm to several fundamental applications -- including dynamic pricing and auction reserve tuning -- all under adversarial reward models. While these domains often violate Lipschitzness, our analysis only requires a weaker version thereof, allowing for meaningful regret bounds without additional smoothness assumptions. Notably, we extend our results to multi-product dynamic pricing with non-smooth reward structures, a setting which does not even satisfy one-sided Lipschitzness.</description>

      <title>Noise Balance and Stationary Distribution of Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is the algorithm we use to train neural networks. However, it remains poorly understood how the SGD navigates the highly nonlinear and degenerate loss landscape of a neural network. In this work, we show that the minibatch noise of SGD regularizes the solution towards a noise-balanced solution whenever the loss function contains a rescaling parameter symmetry. Because the difference between a simple diffusion process and SGD dynamics is the most significant when symmetries are present, our theory implies that the loss function symmetries constitute an essential probe of how SGD works. We then apply this result to derive the stationary distribution of stochastic gradient flow for a diagonal linear network with arbitrary depth and width. The stationary distribution exhibits complicated nonlinear phenomena such as phase transitions, broken ergodicity, and fluctuation inversion. These phenomena are shown to exist uniquely in deep networks, implying a fundamental difference between deep and shallow models.</description>

Abstract: Bandit convex optimisation is a fundamental framework for studying zeroth-order convex optimisation. This book covers the many tools used for this problem, including cutting plane methods, interior point methods, continuous exponential weights, gradient descent and online Newton step. The nuances between the many assumptions and setups are explained. Although there is not much truly new here, some existing tools are applied in novel ways to obtain new algorithms. A few bounds are improved in minor ways.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Generalize on Low Complexity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.</description>

      <title>Simplicity bias and optimization threshold in two-layer ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding generalization of overparametrized neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Most of the literature mostly studies generalization from an interpolation point of view, taking convergence of parameters towards a global minimum of the training loss for granted. While overparametrized architectures indeed interpolated the data for typical classification tasks, this interpolation paradigm does not seem valid anymore for more complex tasks such as in-context learning or diffusion. Instead for such tasks, it has been empirically observed that the trained models goes from global minima to spurious local minima of the training loss as the number of training samples becomes larger than some level we call optimization threshold. While the former yields a poor generalization to the true population loss, the latter was observed to actually correspond to the minimiser of this true loss. This paper explores theoretically this phenomenon in the context of two-layer ReLU networks. We demonstrate that, despite overparametrization, networks often converge toward simpler solutions rather than interpolating the training data, which can lead to a drastic improvement on the test loss with respect to interpolating solutions. Our analysis relies on the so called early alignment phase, during which neurons align towards specific directions. This directional alignment, which occurs in the early stage of training, leads to a simplicity bias, wherein the network approximates the ground truth model without converging to the global minimum of the training loss. Our results suggest that this bias, resulting in an optimization threshold from which interpolation is not reached anymore, is beneficial and enhances the generalization of trained models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. However, its application to large datasets containing personal information (e.g., web interactions, search history, personal tastes) raises critical privacy problems. This paper addresses these issues by proposing enhanced privacy-preserving variants of the method. First, we propose a variant that reduces the amount of the noise required in current techniques to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). More precisely, we refine the privacy analysis so that the Gaussian noise variance no longer grows linearly with the target rank, achieving the same DP guarantees with strictly less noise. Second, we adapt our method to a decentralized framework in which data is distributed among multiple users. The decentralized protocol strengthens privacy guarantees with no accuracy penalty and a low computational and communication overhead. Our results include the provision of tighter convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions, and an empirical comparison with previous work using real recommendation datasets.</description>

      <title>Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust model performance in diverse real-world scenarios requires addressing generalizability across domains with covariate shifts. However, no formal procedure exists for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning algorithms. Existing predictive metrics like mean squared error (MSE) help to quantify the relative performance between models, but do not directly answer whether a model can or cannot generalize. To address this gap in the domain of causal inference, we propose a systematic framework for statistically evaluating the generalizability of high-dimensional causal inference models. Our approach uses the frugal parameterization to flexibly simulate from fully and semi-synthetic causal benchmarks, offering a comprehensive evaluation for both mean and distributional regression methods. Grounded in real-world data, our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics, providing statistical safeguards for decision making.</description>

      <title>Are you doing better than random guessing? A call for using negative controls when evaluating causal discovery algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New proposals for causal discovery algorithms are typically evaluated using simulations and a few selected real data examples with known data generating mechanisms. However, there does not exist a general guideline for how such evaluation studies should be designed, and therefore, comparing results across different studies can be difficult. In this article, we propose to use negative controls as a common evaluation baseline by posing the question: Are we doing better than random guessing? For the task of graph skeleton estimation, we derive exact distributional results under random guessing for the expected behavior of a range of typical causal discovery evaluation metrics, including precision and recall. We show that these metrics can achieve very favorable values under random guessing in certain scenarios, and hence warn against using them without also reporting negative control results, i.e., performance under random guessing. We also propose an exact test of overall skeleton fit, and showcase its use on a real data application. Finally, we propose a general pipeline for using negative controls beyond the skeleton estimation task, and apply it both in a simulated example and a real data application.</description>

      <title>PASCO (PArallel Structured COarsening): an overlay to speed up graph clustering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering the nodes of a graph is a cornerstone of graph analysis and has been extensively studied. However, some popular methods are not suitable for very large graphs: e.g., spectral clustering requires the computation of the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix, which is not applicable for large graphs with a large number of communities. This work introduces PASCO, an overlay that accelerates clustering algorithms. Our method consists of three steps: 1-We compute several independent small graphs representing the input graph by applying an efficient and structure-preserving coarsening algorithm. 2-A clustering algorithm is run in parallel onto each small graph and provides several partitions of the initial graph. 3-These partitions are aligned and combined with an optimal transport method to output the final partition. The PASCO framework is based on two key contributions: a novel global algorithm structure designed to enable parallelization and a fast, empirically validated graph coarsening algorithm that preserves structural properties. We demonstrate the strong performance of 1 PASCO in terms of computational efficiency, structural preservation, and output partition quality, evaluated on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets.</description>

      <title>Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the condition number of the weight matrix and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We control these issues by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations, yielding the regularized algorithm ReBlocK. Numerical experiments including examples arising from natural gradient optimization demonstrate that ReBlocK can outperform both RBK and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for inconsistent problems with rapidly decaying singular values.</description>

      <title>Upweighting Easy Samples in Fine-Tuning Mitigates Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a downstream task often degrades its original capabilities, a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". This is especially an issue when one does not have access to the data and recipe used to develop the pre-trained model. Under this constraint, most existing methods for mitigating forgetting are inapplicable. To address this challenge, we propose a sample weighting scheme for the fine-tuning data solely based on the pre-trained model's losses. Specifically, we upweight the easy samples on which the pre-trained model's loss is low and vice versa to limit the drift from the pre-trained model. Our approach is orthogonal and yet complementary to existing methods; while such methods mostly operate on parameter or gradient space, we concentrate on the sample space. We theoretically analyze the impact of fine-tuning with our method in a linear setting, showing that it stalls learning in a certain subspace which inhibits overfitting to the target task. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method on both language and vision tasks. As an example, when fine-tuning Gemma 2 2B on MetaMathQA, our method results in only a $0.8\%$ drop in accuracy on GSM8K (another math dataset) compared to standard fine-tuning, while preserving $5.4\%$ more accuracy on the pre-training datasets.

      <title>From Features to Graphs: Exploring Graph Structures and Pairwise Interactions via GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature interaction is crucial in predictive machine learning models, as it captures the relationships between features that influence model performance. In this work, we focus on pairwise interactions and investigate their importance in constructing feature graphs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We leverage existing GNN models and tools to explore the relationship between feature graph structures and their effectiveness in modeling interactions. Through experiments on synthesized datasets, we uncover that edges between interacting features are important for enabling GNNs to model feature interactions effectively. We also observe that including non-interaction edges can act as noise, degrading model performance. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support for sparse feature graph selection using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We prove that feature graphs retaining only necessary interaction edges yield a more efficient and interpretable representation than complete graphs, aligning with Occam's Razor. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing feature graphs that improve the performance and interpretability of GNN models.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Linear Bandits: Huber Regression with One-Pass Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed noise. Two principled strategies for handling heavy-tailed noise, truncation and median-of-means, have been introduced to heavy-tailed bandits. Nonetheless, these methods rely on specific noise assumptions or bandit structures, limiting their applicability to general settings. The recent work [Huang et al.2024] develops a soft truncation method via the adaptive Huber regression to address these limitations. However, their method suffers undesired computational costs: it requires storing all historical data and performing a full pass over these data at each round. In this paper, we propose a \emph{one-pass} algorithm based on the online mirror descent framework. Our method updates using only current data at each round, reducing the per-round computational cost from $\mathcal{O}(t \log T)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ with respect to current round $t$ and the time horizon $T$, and achieves a near-optimal and variance-aware regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d T^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \nu_t^2} + d T^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}\big)$ where $d$ is the dimension and $\nu_t^{1+\epsilon}$ is the $(1+\epsilon)$-th central moment of reward at round $t$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Transformation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical Transformation Models (GTMs) are introduced as a novel approach to effectively model multivariate data with intricate marginals and complex dependency structures non-parametrically, while maintaining interpretability through the identification of varying conditional independencies. GTMs extend multivariate transformation models by replacing the Gaussian copula with a custom-designed multivariate transformation, offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture more complex interdependencies using penalized splines, which also provide an efficient regularization scheme. Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs using a lasso penalty towards pairwise conditional independencies, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn parametric vine copulas and identify conditional independencies. Additionally, the model is applied to a benchmark astrophysics dataset, where the GTM demonstrates favorable performance compared to non-parametric vine copulas in learning complex multivariate distributions.</description>

      <title>Locally minimax optimal and dimension-agnostic discrete argmin inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a fundamental inference problem: given $n$ observations from a $d$ dimensional vector with unknown mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, we must form a confidence set for the index (or indices) corresponding to the smallest component of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. By duality, we reduce this to testing, for each $r$ in $1,\ldots,d$, whether $\mu_r$ is the smallest. Based on the sample splitting and self-normalization approach of Kim and Ramdas (2024), we propose "dimension-agnostic" tests that maintain validity regardless of how $d$ scales with $n$, and regardless of arbitrary ties in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Notably, our validity holds under mild moment conditions, requiring little more than finiteness of a second moment, and permitting possibly strong dependence between coordinates. In addition, we establish the local minimax separation rate for this problem, which adapts to the cardinality of a confusion set, and show that the proposed tests attain this rate. Furthermore, we develop robust variants that continue to achieve the same minimax rate under heavy-tailed distributions with only finite second moments. Empirical results on simulated and real data illustrate the strong performance of our approach in terms of type I error control and power compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding is that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely functions of the composition function $G := F_p \circ F_n^{-1}$, where $F_p(\cdot)$ and $F_n(\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution functions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes, respectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating points, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between classifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves reflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers optimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We further explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and numerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance on ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative class leakage function $G(\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The framework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration, cost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world capacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier deployment and decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity and Representation Ability of Test-time Scaling Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction -- remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta &lt; 1$ denotes the probability gap between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feature Scaling In Machine Learning: Effects on Regression and Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy, MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time, and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM) demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.</description>
