      <title>Quantum Powered Credit Risk Assessment: A Novel Approach using hybrid Quantum-Classical Deep Neural Network for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) techniques into the landscape of financial risk analysis presents a promising avenue for innovation. This study introduces a framework for credit risk assessment in the banking sector, combining quantum deep learning techniques with adaptive modeling for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis (RTDPA). By leveraging RTDPA, the proposed approach tailors predictive models to different loan categories, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk evaluation. While this work explores the potential of integrating quantum methods with classical deep learning for risk assessment, it focuses on the feasibility and performance of this hybrid framework rather than claiming transformative industry-wide impacts. The findings offer insights into how quantum techniques can complement traditional financial analysis, paving the way for further advancements in predictive modeling for credit risk.</description>

      <title>Trend-encoded Probabilistic Multi-order Model: A Non-Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Stock Market Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the dominance of machine learning in stock market forecasting has been evident. While these models have shown decreasing prediction errors, their robustness across different datasets has been a concern. A successful stock market prediction model minimizes prediction errors and showcases robustness across various data sets, indicating superior forecasting performance. This study introduces a novel multiple lag order probabilistic model based on trend encoding (TeMoP) that enhances stock market predictions through a probabilistic approach. Results across different stock indexes from nine countries demonstrate that the TeMoP outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning models in predicting accuracy and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Minimal Shortfall Strategies for Liquidation of a Basket of Stocks using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the ubiquitous problem of liquidating large quantities of highly correlated stocks, a task frequently encountered by institutional investors and proprietary trading firms. Traditional methods in this setting suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making them impractical for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a novel method based on stochastic optimal control to optimally tackle this complex multidimensional problem. The proposed method minimizes the overall execution shortfall of highly correlated stocks using a reinforcement learning approach. We rigorously establish the convergence of our optimal trading strategy and present an implementation of our algorithm using intra-day market data.</description>

      <title>TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. We address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. Previous works lack realism, usefulness, and responsiveness of the generated simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting an x3.27 and x3.47 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. We assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. We developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for market simulation with deep learning. Our repository includes a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generates simulations. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/DeepMarket.</description>
