      <title>Error terms for the motives of discriminant complements and a Cayley-Bacharach theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove under some simplifying hypotheses questions of Picoco and Levinson-Ullery on Cayley-Bacharach sets. Our results imply that, under suitable hypotheses Cayley-Bacharach sets lie on curves of low degree. We then use these results to estimate error terms to the normalized motive of the space of smooth degree $d$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$as $d$ grows to infinity. The error term can be expressed in terms of a certain `sum over points' on plane cubic curves and the associated Hodge structure can be expressed in terms of the cohomology of the moduli space of elliptic curves. We also prove convergence of the motive of degree $d$ hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ as $n$ grows to infinity as well as other results on discriminant complements of high dimensional varieties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the singular locus of $\mathrm{Sec} (X^{[2]})$ coincides with $X^{[2]}$ under the Grothendieck-Pl\"ucker embedding $X^{[2]} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N$ when $X$ is embedded by a $4$-very ample line bundle. We also prove that the embedding $X^{[2]} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N$ satisfies Green's condition $(N_p)$ when the embedding of $X$ is positive enough. As an application, we describe the geometry of a resolution of singularities from the secant bundle to $\mathrm{Sec}(X^{[2]})$ when $X$ is a surface.</description>

      <title>On Mirror Symmetry and Irrationality of Zeta Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental object of study in mirror symmetry of $n$-dimensional Fano varieties is the A-side connection on small quantum cohomology. When the Picard rank is 1, the Borel transform relates the quantum differential operator of the Fano to the Picard-Fuchs operator of the associated pencil of anticanonical Calabi-Yau $(n-1)$-folds on the Fano variety. Expanding on related work by W. Yang on the Beukers-Peters pencil of K3 surfaces associated with Ap\'ery's proof for the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, for such operators we define holomorphic prepotentials, virtual Yukawa couplings, and virtual instanton numbers, analogous to the usual ingredients of Calabi-Yau mirror symmetry. We prove that when the underlying Calabi-Yau operator is modular, the virtual Yukawa coupling is a modular form of weight-$(n+1)$, with the holomorphic prepotential as an Eichler integral. We then analyze the quantum differential operators for modular pencils of K3 surfaces arising as anticanonical linear systems for the 17 deformation classes of Fano threefolds of Picard rank-1 classified by Iskovskikh from the perspective of Golyshev \&amp; Zagier's proof of the Gamma conjecture for such Fanos, the natural setting of Yang's work. Here, the virtual instanton numbers are proven to be periodic integers with period equal to the level of the modular subgroup. Finally, we conjecture that the geometric nature of these virtual instanton numbers can be understood in terms of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of certain local Calabi-Yau fourfolds.</description>

      <title>A regularization theorem for bounded-degree self-maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic and let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety over $K$. Let $G\subseteq\text{Bir}(X)$ be a bounded-degree subgroup. We prove that there exists an irreducible projective variety $Y$ birational to $X$, such that every element of $G$ becomes an automorphism of $Y$ after the birational transformation. If $K=\mathbb{C}$, this result is stated in [Can14, Theorem 2.5] and the proof backs to [HZ96, Section 5]. The proof in [HZ96] is not purely algebraic. Inheriting the methods in [HZ96], we give a purely algebraic proof of this statement in arbitrary characteristic. We will also discuss a corollary of this result which is useful in arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for the Cremona groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cremona groups are the groups of all birational equivalences of projective spaces and, equivalently, the automorphism groups of the rational function fields. We construct highly connected spaces on which these groups act in a way that allows us to deduce that their abelianisations, and more generally, the homologies of these groups, stabilise as the dimension increases.</description>

      <title>Springer correspondence and mirror symmetries for parabolic Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Strominger--Yau--Zaslow and topological mirror symmetries for parabolic Hitchin systems of types B and C. In contrast to type A, a geometric reinterpretation of Springer duality is necessary. Furthermore, unlike Hitchin's construction in the non-parabolic case, the map between generic fibers in type B and C needs more analysis due to the change of partitions of Springer dual nilpotent orbits, which is the main difficulty in this article. To tackle this challenge, we first construct and study the geometry of the generic Hitchin fibers of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles associated to the nilpotent orbit closures. Then we study their relation with the generic Hitchin fibers of parabolic Hitchin systems. Along this way, we establish intriguing connections between Springer duality, Kazhdan--Lusztig maps, and singularities of spectral curves, and uncover a new geometric interpretation of Lusztig's canonical quotient.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the configuration space of orbits, a generalization of the configuration space of points but for algebraic varieties that are acted by an algebraic reductive group. We develop a novel method for computing the $S_n$-equivariant $E$-polynomial of an algebraic variety, and we apply it to this new kind of varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety. We study (decompositions of) the motivic class, in the Grothendieck ring of stacks, of the stack $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X)$ of $0$-dimensional coherent sheaves of length $n$ on $X$. To do so, we review the construction of the support map $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X) \to \mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$ to the symmetric product and we prove that, for any closed point $p \in X$, the punctual stack $\mathscr{C}oh^n(X)_p$ parametrising sheaves supported at $p$ only depends on a formal neighbourhood of $p$. We perform the same analysis for the Quot-to-Chow morphism $\mathrm{Quot}_X(\mathcal E,n) \to \mathrm{Sym}^n(X)$, for a fixed sheaf $\mathcal E \in \mathrm{Coh}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Chern Characteristics and Todd-Hirzebruch Identities for Transpolar Pairs of Toric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard toric geometry methods used to construct Calabi-Yau varieties may be extended to complete intersections in non-Fano varieties encoded by star triangulating non-convex polytopes. Similarly, mirror symmetry is conjectured to hold in terms of a transpolar duality generalizing the original construction of Batyrev and Borisov. The associated mirror pairs naturally include certain flip-folded, multi-layered multihedral objects, inclusively named VEX multitopes, and a correspondingly generalized transpolar duality. These self-overlaying VEX multitopes, long since known in pre-symplectic geometry, are found to correspond to certain non-algebraic but smooth toric spaces with Chern classes that satisfy the standard Todd-Hirzebruch identities. The computation of diffeomorphism invariants, including characteristic submanifold intersection numbers, corroborates their recent inclusion in the connected web of Calabi-Yau spaces and associated string compactifications: They arise together with the standard (Fano/reflexive polytope) constructions, within deformation families of generalized complete intersections in products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>A $\pi_1$ obstruction to having finite index monodromy and an unusual subgroup of infinite index in $\textrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic surface with $\mathcal{L}$ an ample line bundle on $X$.
  Let $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})$ be the \emph{geometric monodromy} group associated to family of nonsingular curves in $X$ that are zero loci of sections of $\mathcal{L}$. We provide obstructions to $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{L})$ being finite index in the mapping class group. We also show that for any $k \ge 0$, the image of monodromy is finite index in appropriate subgroups of the quotient of the mapping class group by the $k$th term of the Johnson filtration assuming that $\mathcal{L}$ is sufficiently ample. This enables us to construct several subgroups of the mapping class group with unusual properties, in some cases providing the first examples of subgroups with those properties.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the ponted set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.</description>

      <title>On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures.
  A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$.
  For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications.
  We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety equipped with a dominant rational self-map $\phi:X\to X$. A new quantity measuring the interaction of $(X,\phi)$ with trivial dynamical systems is introduced; the stabilised algebraic dimension of $(X,\phi)$ captures the maximum number of new algebraically independent invariant rational functions on the cartesian product of $(X, \phi)$ and $(Y, \psi)$, as $(Y,\psi)$ ranges over all algebraic dynamical systems. It is shown that this birational invariant agrees with the maximum dimension of a dominant equivariant rational image $(X',\phi')$ where $\phi'$ is part of an algebraic group action on $X'$. As a consequence, it is deduced that if some cartesian power of $(X,\phi)$ admits a nonconstant invariant rational function, then already the second cartesian power does.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified $p$-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of tropical unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$ where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify a contractible subcomplex of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected for all $g$ and $p$. In the case of genus $2$ we fully determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>A formalism of $F$-modules for rings with complete local finite $F$-representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism of unit $F$-modules in the style of Lyubeznik and Emerton-Kisin for rings which have finite $F$-representation type after localization and completion at every prime ideal. As applications, we show that if $R$ is such a ring then the iterated local cohomology modules $H^{n_1}_{I_1} \circ \cdots \circ H^{n_s}_{I_s}(R)$ have finitely many associated primes, and that all local cohomology modules $H^n_I(R / gR)$ have closed support when $g$ is a nonzerodivisor on $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An example of Cornalba and Shiffman from 1972 disproves in dimension two or higher a classical prediction that the count of zeros of holomorphic self-mappings of the complex linear space should be controlled by the maximum modulus function. We prove that such a bound holds for a modified coarse count inspired by the theory of persistence modules originating in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood of vertices in the isogeny graph of principally polarized superspecial abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two supersingular elliptic curves $E$ and $E'$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, let $[E \times E']$ be the superspecial abelian surface with the principal polarization $\{0\} \times E' + E \times \{0\}$. We determine local structure of the vertices $[E \times E']$ in the $(\ell, \ell)$-isogeny graph of principally polarized superspecial abelian surfaces where either $E$ or $E'$ is defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We also present a simple new proof of the main theorem in \cite{LOX20}.</description>

      <title>Group actions on monoidal triangulated categories and Balmer spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a left or right rigid monoidal triangulated category ${\mathbf K}$ which has a Noetherian Balmer spectrum. We prove that the Balmer spectrum of the crossed product category of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals of ${\mathbf K}$, give a concrete description of this space, and classify the $G$-invariant thick ideals of ${\mathbf K}$. Under some additional technical conditions, we prove that the Balmer spectrum of the equivariantization of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is also homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals. Examples of stable categories of finite tensor categories and perfect derived categories of coherent sheaves on Noetherian schemes are used to illustrate the theory.</description>
