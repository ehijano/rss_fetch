      <title>On Artin groups admitting retractions to parabolic subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the retractions to standard parabolic subgroups for even Artin groups to FC-type Artin groups and other more general families. We prove that these retractions uniquely extend to any parabolic subgroup. We use retractions to generalize the results of Antol\'in and Foniqi that reduce the problem of intersection of parabolic subgroups to weaker conditions. As a corollary, we characterize coherence for the FC case.</description>

      <title>The Chebotarev invariant for direct products of nonabelian finite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $\{g_1, \ldots , g_d\}$ of a finite group $G$ invariably generates $G$ if $\{g_1^{x_1}, \ldots , g_d^{x_d}\}$ generates $G$ for every choice of $x_i \in G$. The Chebotarev invariant $C(G)$ of $G$ is the expected value of the random variable $n$ that is minimal subject to the requirement that $n$ randomly chosen elements of $G$ invariably generate $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a nonabelian finite simple group, then $C(G)$ is absolutely bounded. More generally, we show that if $G$ is a direct product of $k$ nonabelian finite simple groups, then $C(G)=\log{k}/\log{\alpha(G)}+O(1)$, where $\alpha$ is an invariant completely determined by the proportion of derangements of the primitive permutation actions of the factors in $G$. It follows from the proof of the Boston-Shalev conjecture that $C(G)=O(\log{k})$. We also derive sharp bounds on the expected number of generators for $G$.</description>

      <title>Lannes' $T$-functor and mod-$p$ cohomology of profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lannes-Quillen theorem relates the mod-$p$ cohomology of a finite group $G$ with the mod-$p$ cohomology of centralizers of abelian elementary $p$-subgroups of $G$, for $p&gt;0$ a prime number. This theorem was extended to profinite groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology algebra is finitely generated by Henn. In a weaker form, the Lannes-Quillen theorem was then extended by Symonds to arbitrary profinite groups. Building on Symonds' result, we formulate and prove a full version of this theorem for all profinite groups. For this purpose, we develop a theory of products for families of discrete torsion modules, parameterized by a profinite space, which is dual, in a very precise sense, to the theory of coproducts for families of profinite modules, parameterized by a profinite space, developed by Haran, Melnikov and Ribes. In the last section, we give applications to the problem of conjugacy separability of $p$-torsion elements and finite $p$-subgroups.</description>

      <title>A tensor product for representations of the Cuntz algebra and of the R. Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors continue a series of articles studying certain unitary representations of the Richard Thompson groups $F,T,V$ called Pythagorean. They all extend to the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}$ and conversely all representations of $\mathcal{O}$ are of this form. Via this approach we introduce a tensor product for a large class of representations of $F,T,V,\mathcal{O}$. We prove that a sub-category forms a tensor category and perform a number of explicit computations of fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Vertex-primitive s-arc-transitive digraphs of symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A digraph is $s$-arc-transitive if its automorphism group is transitive on directed paths with $s$ edges, that is, on $s$-arcs. Although infinite families of finite $s$-arc transitive digraphs of arbitrary valency were constructed by the third author in 1989, existence of a vertex-primitive $2$-arc-transitive digraph was not known until an infinite family was constructed by the second author with Li and Xia in 2017. This led to a conjecture by the second author and Xia in 2018 that, for a finite vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraph, $s$ is at most $2$, together with their proof that it is sufficient to prove the conjecture for digraphs with an almost simple group of automorphisms. This paper confirms the conjecture for finite symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>A congruence subgroup property for symmetric mapping class groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the congruence subgroup property for the centralizer of a finite subgroup $G$ in the mapping class group of a hyperbolic oriented and connected surface of finite topological type $S$ such that the genus of the quotient surface $S/G$ is at most $2$. As an application, we show that torsion elements in the mapping class group of a surface of genus $\leq 2$ are conjugacy distinguished.</description>

      <title>Graphically discrete groups and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of graphical discreteness to group theory. A finitely generated group is graphically discrete if whenever it acts geometrically on a locally finite graph, the automorphism group of the graph is compact-by-discrete. Notable examples include finitely generated nilpotent groups, most lattices in semisimple Lie groups, and irreducible non-geometric 3-manifold groups. We show graphs of groups with graphically discrete vertex groups frequently have strong rigidity properties. We prove free products of one-ended virtually torsion-free graphically discrete groups are action rigid within the class of virtually torsion-free groups. We also prove quasi-isometric rigidity for many hyperbolic graphs of groups whose vertex groups are closed hyperbolic manifold groups and whose edge groups are non-elementary quasi-convex subgroups. This includes the case of two hyperbolic 3-manifold groups amalgamated along a quasi-convex malnormal non-abelian free subgroup. We provide several additional examples of graphically discrete groups and illustrate this property is not a commensurability invariant.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with the F\o lner property is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>Representations of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore linear representations of skew left braces, which are known to provide bijective non-degenerate set-theoretical solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation that are not necessarily involutive. A skew left brace $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ induces an action $\lambda^{\op}: (A, \circ) \to \Aut (A, \cdot)$, which gives rise to the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}} = (A, \cdot) \rtimes_{\lambda^{\op}} (A, \circ)$. We prove that if $A$ and $B$ are isoclinic skew left braces, then $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$ and $\Lambda_{B^{\op}}$ are also isoclinic under some mild restrictions on the centers of the respective groups. Our key observation is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ and that of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. We obtain a decomposition of the induced representation of the additive group $(A, \cdot)$ and of the multiplicative group $(A, \circ)$ corresponding to the regular representation of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. As examples, we compute the dimensions of the irreducible representations for several skew left braces with prime power orders.</description>

      <title>Property (T) for Banach algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study the notion of property $(\rm T)$ for Banach algebras, generalizing the one from $C^*$-algebras. For a second countable locally compact group $G$ and a given family of Banach spaces $\mathcal E$, we prove that our Banach algebraic property $(\rm{T}_{\mathcal E})$ of the symmetrized pseudofunction algebras $F^*_{\mathcal E}(G)$ characterizes the Banach property $(\rm{T}_{\mathcal E})$ of Bader, Furman, Gelander and Monod for groups. In case $G$ is a discrete group and $\mathcal E$ is the class of $L^p$-spaces for $1\leq p &lt; \infty$, we also achieve the analogue characterization using the symmetrized $p$-pseudofunction algebras $F^*_{\lambda_ p}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Counting pseudo-Anosovs as weakly contracting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that pseudo-Anosov mapping classes are generic in every Cayley graph of the mapping class group of a finite-type hyperbolic surface. Our method also yields an analogous result for rank-one CAT(0) groups and hierarchically hyperbolic groups with Morse elements. Finally, we prove that Morse elements are generic in every Cayley graph of groups that are quasi-isometric to (well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This gives a quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>
