      <title>Accelerated Convolutive Transfer Function-Based Multichannel NMF Using Iterative Source Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among numerous blind source separation (BSS) methods, convolutive transfer function-based multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (CTF-MNMF) has demonstrated strong performance in highly reverberant environments by modeling multi-frame correlations of delayed source signals. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the high computational cost associated with the iterative projection (IP) update rule, which requires matrix inversion for each source. To address this issue, we propose an efficient variant of CTF-MNMF that integrates iterative source steering (ISS), a matrix inversion-free update rule for separation filters. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior separation performance to the original CTF-MNMF, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Linear RNNs for autoregressive generation of long music samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs, can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Latent Multi-view Learning for Robust Environmental Sound Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02500v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, such as contrastive and generative methods, have advanced environmental sound representation learning using unlabeled data. However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</description>

      <title>TART: A Comprehensive Tool for Technique-Aware Audio-to-Tab Guitar Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) has advanced significantly for the piano, but transcription for the guitar remains limited due to several key challenges. Existing systems fail to detect and annotate expressive techniques (e.g., slides, bends, percussive hits) and incorrectly map notes to the wrong string and fret combination in the generated tablature. Furthermore, prior models are typically trained on small, isolated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world guitar recordings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a four-stage end-to-end pipeline that produces detailed guitar tablature directly from audio. Our system consists of (1) Audio-to-MIDI pitch conversion through a piano transcription model adapted to guitar datasets; (2) MLP-based expressive technique classification; (3) Transformer-based string and fret assignment; and (4) LSTM-based tablature generation. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to generate detailed tablature with accurate fingerings and expressive labels from guitar audio.</description>

      <title>Flamed-TTS: Flow Matching Attention-Free Models for Efficient Generating and Dynamic Pacing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently advanced significantly, enabling models to synthesize speech from text using short, limited-context prompts. These prompts serve as voice exemplars, allowing the model to mimic speaker identity, prosody, and other traits without extensive speaker-specific data. Although recent approaches incorporating language models, diffusion, and flow matching have proven their effectiveness in zero-shot TTS, they still encounter challenges such as unreliable synthesis caused by token repetition or unexpected content transfer, along with slow inference and substantial computational overhead. Moreover, temporal diversity-crucial for enhancing the naturalness of synthesized speech-remains largely underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose Flamed-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS framework that emphasizes low computational cost, low latency, and high speech fidelity alongside rich temporal diversity. To achieve this, we reformulate the flow matching training paradigm and incorporate both discrete and continuous representations corresponding to different attributes of speech. Experimental results demonstrate that Flamed-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, speaker similarity, acoustic characteristics preservation, and dynamic pace. Notably, Flamed-TTS achieves the best WER of 4% compared to the leading zero-shot TTS baselines, while maintaining low latency in inference and high fidelity in generated speech. Code and audio samples are available at our demo page https://flamed-tts.github.io.</description>

      <title>Forensic Similarity for Speech Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a digital audio forensics approach called Forensic Similarity for Speech Deepfakes, which determines whether two audio segments contain the same forensic traces or not. Our work is inspired by prior work in the image domain on forensic similarity, which proved strong generalization capabilities against unknown forensic traces, without requiring prior knowledge of them at training time. To achieve this in the audio setting, we propose a two-part deep-learning system composed of a feature extractor based on a speech deepfake detector backbone and a shallow neural network, referred to as the similarity network. This system maps pairs of audio segments to a score indicating whether they contain the same or different forensic traces. We evaluate the system on the emerging task of source verification, highlighting its ability to identify whether two samples originate from the same generative model. Additionally, we assess its applicability to splicing detection as a complementary use case. Experiments show that the method generalizes to a wide range of forensic traces, including previously unseen ones, illustrating its flexibility and practical value in digital audio forensics.</description>

      <title>WavInWav: Time-domain Speech Hiding via Invertible Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>SALSA-V: Shortcut-Augmented Long-form Synchronized Audio from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SALSA-V, a multimodal video-to-audio generation model capable of synthesizing highly synchronized, high-fidelity long-form audio from silent video content. Our approach introduces a masked diffusion objective, enabling audio-conditioned generation and the seamless synthesis of audio sequences of unconstrained length. Additionally, by integrating a shortcut loss into our training process, we achieve rapid generation of high-quality audio samples in as few as eight sampling steps, paving the way for near-real-time applications without requiring dedicated fine-tuning or retraining. We demonstrate that SALSA-V significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both audiovisual alignment and synchronization with video content in quantitative evaluation and a human listening study. Furthermore, our use of random masking during training enables our model to match spectral characteristics of reference audio samples, broadening its applicability to professional audio synthesis tasks such as Foley generation and sound design.</description>

      <title>AudioToolAgent: An Agentic Framework for Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) perform well on audio understanding tasks but lack multi-step reasoning and tool-calling found in recent Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper presents AudioToolAgent, a framework that coordinates audio-language models as tools via a central LLM agent that accesses tool adapters for audio question answering and speech-to-text. The agent selects tools, asks follow-up questions, and compares outputs for verification. Experiments with MMAU, MMAR, and MMAU-Pro show state-of-the-art accuracy: up to 74.10% on MMAU, 68.80% on MMAR, and 57.96% on MMAU-Pro. Monte Carlo sampling for shapley values across 374 configurations identifies effective agent-tool combinations. The modular design allows integration of new tools and eliminates the use of data and training costs. Code and reproduction materials are available at: github.com/GLJS/AudioToolAgent</description>

      <title>WEE-Therapy: A Mixture of Weak Encoders Framework for Psychological Counseling Dialogue Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models (AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data, struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted clinical analysis.</description>

      <title>When Voice Matters: Evidence of Gender Disparity in Positional Bias of SpeechLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of SpeechLLM-based conversational AI systems has created a need for robustly benchmarking these efforts, including aspects of fairness and bias. At present, such benchmarks typically rely on multiple choice question answering (MCQA). In this paper, we present the first token-level probabilistic evaluation and response-based study of several issues affecting the use of MCQA in SpeechLLM benchmarking: 1) we examine how model temperature and prompt design affect gender and positional bias on an MCQA gender-bias benchmark; 2) we examine how these biases are affected by the gender of the input voice; and 3) we study to what extent observed trends carry over to a second gender-bias benchmark. Our results show that concerns about positional bias from the text domain are equally valid in the speech domain. We also find the effect to be stronger for female voices than for male voices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to isolate positional bias effects in SpeechLLM-based gender-bias benchmarks. We conclude that current MCQA benchmarks do not account for speech-based bias and alternative strategies are needed to ensure fairness towards all users.</description>

      <title>STSM-FiLM: A FiLM-Conditioned Neural Architecture for Time-Scale Modification of Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-Scale Modification (TSM) of speech aims to alter the playback rate of audio without changing its pitch. While classical methods like Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add (WSOLA) provide strong baselines, they often introduce artifacts under non-stationary or extreme stretching conditions. We propose STSM-FILM - a fully neural architecture that incorporates Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to condition the model on a continuous speed factor. By supervising the network using WSOLA-generated outputs, STSM-FILM learns to mimic alignment and synthesis behaviors while benefiting from representations learned through deep learning. We explore four encoder-decoder variants: STFT-HiFiGAN, WavLM-HiFiGAN, Whisper-HiFiGAN, and EnCodec, and demonstrate that STSM-FILM is capable of producing perceptually consistent outputs across a wide range of time-scaling factors. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of FiLM-based conditioning to improve the generalization and flexibility of neural TSM models.</description>

      <title>CVSM: Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of large, unlabeled datasets across various domains has contributed to the development of a plethora of methods that learn representations for multiple target (downstream) tasks through self-supervised pre-training. In this work, we introduce CVSM (Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling), a contrastive self-supervised procedure for music signal representation learning in the audio domain that can be utilized for musical and vocal similarity modeling. Our method operates under a contrastive framework, maximizing the similarity between vocal excerpts and musical mixtures containing the same vocals; we devise both a label-informed protocol, leveraging artist identity information to sample the contrastive pairs, and a label-agnostic scheme, involving artificial mixture creation from randomly sampled vocal and accompaniment excerpts, which are paired with vocals from the same audio segment. We evaluate our proposed method in measuring vocal similarity both objectively, through linear probing on a suite of appropriate downstream tasks, and subjectively, via conducting a user study consisting of pairwise comparisons between different models in a recommendation-by-query setting. Our results indicate that the representations learned through CVSM are effective in musical and vocal similarity modeling, outperforming numerous baselines across both isolated vocals and complete musical mixtures. Moreover, while the availability of artist identity labels during pre-training leads to overall more consistent performance both in the evaluated downstream tasks and the user study, a label-agnostic CVSM variant incorporating hybrid pre-training with real and artificial mixtures achieves comparable performance to the label-informed one in artist identification and perceived vocal similarity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better Scaling than CoT Prompting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it. CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.</description>

      <title>Listening or Reading? Evaluating Speech Awareness in Chain-of-Thought Speech-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced, with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic information into translation.</description>

      <title>Taming Text-to-Sounding Video Generation via Advanced Modality Condition and Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task, Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>PAGURI: a user experience study of creative interaction with text-to-music models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-music models have been the biggest breakthrough in automatic music generation. While they are unquestionably a showcase of technological progress, it is not clear yet how they can be realistically integrated into the artistic practice of musicians and music practitioners. This paper aims to address this question via Prompt Audio Generation User Research Investigation (PAGURI), a user experience study where we leverage recent text-to-music developments to study how musicians and practitioners interact with these systems, evaluating their satisfaction levels. We developed an online tool through which users can generate music samples and/or apply recently proposed personalization techniques based on fine-tuning to allow the text-to-music model to generate sounds closer to their needs and preferences. Using semi-structured interviews, we analyzed different aspects related to how participants interacted with the proposed tool to understand the current effectiveness and limitations of text-to-music models in enhancing users' creativity. Our research centers on user experiences to uncover insights that can guide the future development of TTM models and their role in AI-driven music creation. Additionally, they offered insightful perspectives on potential system improvements and their integration into their music practices. The results obtained through the study reveal the pros and cons of the use of TTMs for creative endeavors. Participants recognized the system's creative potential and appreciated the usefulness of its personalization features. However, they also identified several challenges that must be addressed before TTMs are ready for real-world music creation, particularly issues of prompt ambiguity, limited controllability, and integration into existing workflows.</description>

      <title>A Speech Enhancement Method Using Fast Fourier Transform and Convolutional Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of audio signals from degraded measurements. We propose a lightweight model that combines the discrete Fourier transform with a Convolutional Autoencoder (FFT-ConvAE), which enabled our team to achieve second place in the Helsinki Speech Challenge 2024. Our results, together with those of other teams, demonstrate the potential of neural-network-free approaches for effective speech signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TangRain/SingMOS-Pro.</description>

      <title>Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/youngsheen/SimVQ.</description>

      <title>JALMBench: Benchmarking Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs). While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present JALMBench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 11,316 text samples and 245,355 audio samples with over 1,000 hours. It supports 12 mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and 5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and architecture. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the prompt level and the response level.</description>

      <title>AudioStory: Generating Long-Form Narrative Audio with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.
