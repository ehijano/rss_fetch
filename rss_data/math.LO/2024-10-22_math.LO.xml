      <title>Generic Absoluteness Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the relation between recurrence axioms and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms in light of principles of generic absoluteness and the Ground Axiom.
  M.Viale proved that Martin's Maximum$^{++}$ together with the assumption that there are class many Woodin cardinals implies $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}}\prec_{\Sigma_2}\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}[\mathbb{G}]}$ for a generic $\mathbb{G}$ on any stationary preserving $\mathbb{P}$ which also preserves Bounded Martin's Maximum. We show that a similar but more general conclusion follows from each of $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_{\Sigma_2}$-${\sf RcA}^+$ (which is a fragment of a reformulation of the Maximality Principle for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(\kappa)$), and the existence of the tightly $\mathcal{P}$-Laver-generically huge cardinal.
  While under ``$\mathcal{P}=$ all stationary preserving posets'', our results are not very much more than Viale's theorem, for other classes of posets, ``$\mathcal{P}=$ all proper posets'' or ``$\mathcal{P}=$ all ccc posets'', for example, our theorems are not at all covered by his theorem.
  The assumptions (and hence also the conclusion) of Viale's Theorem are compatible with the Ground Axiom. In contrast, we show that the assumptions of our theorems (for most of the common settings of $\mathcal{P}$ and with a modification of the large cardinal property involved) imply the negation of the Ground Axiom. This fact is used to show that fragments of Recurrence Axiom $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$-${\sf RcA}^+$ can be different from the corresponding fragments of Maximality Principle ${\sf MP}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$ for $\Gamma=\Pi_2$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Pi_3$.</description>

      <title>Solovay reducibility via translation functions on rationals and on reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solovay reducibility $\redsolovay$ was introduced by Robert M. Solovay in 1975 via translation functions on rationals. In 2022, its totalized version $\redsolovaytotal$ (i.e., Solovay reducibility via a total function on rationals) has been examined by Merkle and Titov (arXiv:2407.14869).
  In 2020, Kumabe, Miyabe, Mizusawa and Suzuki (arXiv:1903.08625) have discovered that Solovay reducibility can be characterized on left-c.e.\ reals using the notion of a translation function on reals. In 2024, Kumabe, Miyabe, and Suzuki (DOI: 10.3233/COM-230486) have introduced a new reducibility $\redclopen$ on all reals, that uses the notion of a translation function on reals, and its totalized version $\redcllocal$. %They have also shown that $\redcllocal$ implies $\redclopen$, wherein the converse is not true even for left-c.e. reals.
  In this work, we show that $\redsolovayreal$ implies $\redclopen$ and $\redsolovaytotal$ implies $\redcllocal$ on all reals.</description>

      <title>The Arithmetical Hierarchy: A Realizability-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the arithmetical hierarchy from the perspective of realizability theory. An experimental observation in classical computability theory is that the notion of degrees of unsolvability for natural arithmetical decision problems only plays a role in counting the number of quantifiers, jumps, or mind-changes. In contrast, we reveal that when the realizability interpretation is combined with many-one reducibility, it becomes possible to classify natural arithmetical problems in a very nontrivial way.</description>

      <title>Minimal signatures with undecidability of representability by binary relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semigroup of binary relations (under composition) on a set $X$ is \emph{complemented} if it is closed under the taking of complements within $X\times X$. We resolve a 1991 problem of Boris Schein by showing that the class of finite unary semigroups that are representable as complemented semigroups of binary relations is undecidable, so composition with complementation forms a minimal subsignature of Tarski's relation algebra signature that has undecidability of representability. In addition we prove similar results for semigroups of binary relations endowed with unary operations returning the kernel and cokernel of a relation. We generalise to signatures which may include arbitrary, definable operations and provide a chain of weaker and weaker signatures, each definable in the previous signature, each having undecidability of representability, but whose limit signature includes composition only, which corresponds to the well known, decidable and finitely axiomatised variety of semigroups. All these results are also proved for representability as binary relations over a finite set.</description>

      <title>Fundamental sequences based on localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on Buchholz' assignment for ordinals below Bachmann-Howard ordinal, see Buchholz 2003, we introduce systems of fundamental sequences for two kinds of relativized $\vartheta$-function-based notation systems of strength $\Pi^1_1{\operatorname{-CA}_0}$ and prove Bachmann property for these systems, which is essential for monotonicity properties of fast growing hierarchies defined on the basis of fundamental sequences. The central notion of our construction is the notion of localization, which was introduced in Wilken 2007.
  The first kind of stepwise defined $\vartheta$-functions over ordinal addition as basic function fits the framework of the ordinal arithmetical toolkit developed in Wilken 2007, whereas the second kind of $\vartheta$-functions is defined simultaneously and will allow for further generalization to larger proof-theoretic ordinals, see Weiermann and Wilken 2011.
  The systems of fundamental sequences given here enable the investigation of fundamental sequences and independence phenomena also in the context of patterns of resemblance, an approach to ordinal notations that is both semantic and combinatorial and was first introduced by Carlson 2001 and further analyzed in Wilken 2006, 2007, and Carlson and Wilken 2012.
  Our exposition is put into the context of the abstract approach to fundamental sequences developed by Buchholz, Cichon, and Weiermann 1994. The results of this paper will be applied in the theory of Goodstein sequences, extending results of Fern\`andez-Duque and Weiermann 2024.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Robbins-Siegmund theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem is one of the most important results in stochastic optimization, where it is widely used to prove the convergence of stochastic algorithms. We provide a quantitative version of the theorem, establishing a bound on how far one needs to look in order to locate a region of metastability in the sense of Tao. Our proof involves a metastable analogue of Doob's theorem for $L_1$-supermartingales along with a series of technical lemmas that make precise how quantitative information propagates through sums and products of stochastic processes. In this way, our paper establishes a general methodology for finding metastable bounds for stochastic processes that can be reduced to supermartingales, and therefore for obtaining quantitative convergence information across a broad class of stochastic algorithms whose convergence proof relies on some variation of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We conclude by discussing how our general quantitative result might be used in practice.</description>

      <title>Locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new fragment of axiomatic set theory for pure sets and for the iteration of power sets within given transitive sets. It turns out that this formal system admits an interesting hierarchy of models with true membership relation and with only finite or countably infinite ordinals. Still a considerable part of mathematics can be formalized within this system.</description>

      <title>On Recurrence Axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Recurrence Axiom for a class $\mathcal{P}$ of \pos\ and a set $A$ of parameters is an axiom scheme in the language of ZFC asserting that if a statement with parameters from $A$ is forced by a poset in $\mathcal{P}$, then there is a ground containing the parameters and satisfying the statement.
  The tightly super-$C^{(\infty)}$-$\mathcal{P}$-Laver generic hyperhuge continuum implies the Recurrence Axiom for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(2^{\aleph_0})$. The consistency strength of this assumption can be decided thanks to our main theorems asserting that the minimal ground (bedrock) exists under a tightly $\mathcal{P}$-generic hyperhuge cardinal $\kappa$, and that $\kappa$ in the bedrock is genuinely hyperhuge, or even super $C^{(\infty)}$ hyperhuge if $\kappa$ is a tightly super-$C^{(\infty)}$-$\mathcal{P}$-Laver generic hyperhuge definable cardinal.
  The Laver Generic Maximum (LGM), one of the strongest combinations of axioms in our context, integrates practically all known set-theoretic principles and axioms in itself, either as its consequences or as theorems holding in (many) grounds of the universe. For example, double plus version of Martin's Maximum is a consequence of LGM while Cicho\'n's Maximum is a phenomenon in many grounds of the universe under LGM.</description>

      <title>Superabelian logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algebraic study of a family of logics related to Abelian logic ($Ab$), the logic of Abelian lattice-ordeded groups. $Ab$ is treated as the basic, weakest logic, and its expansions are referred to as superabelian logics. To account for the language differences in Lukasiewicz logics, we introduced the expansion of $Ab$ with an additional constant and call it pointed Abelian logic ($pAb$), with semantics based on pointed Abelian $l$-groups. We take the first steps in the study of infinitary extensions of $Ab$, give a completeness theorem for $pAb$, and obtain axiomatizations of Lukasiewicz unbound logics relative to $pAb$. The paper concludes with an exploration of other significant extensions of $pAb$ and their algebraic characterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is the problem of evaluating a sentence with both quantifiers, over relations from some constraint language, with conjunction as the only connective. We show that for any constraint language on a finite domain the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is either in $\Pi_{2}^{P}$, or PSpace-complete. Additionally, we build a constraint language on a 6-element domain such that the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem over this language is $\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show: (1) for any two nontrivial countable groups $A$ and $B$ that are measure equivalent, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite; and (2) the groups $A\wr \Gamma$ and $(A\times\mathbf{Z})\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) for every nontrivial countable group $A$.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>
