      <title>The solvable Graph of a finite-dimensional Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the solvable graph $\Gamma_\mathfrak{S}(L)$ of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra $L$ over a field $F$. The vertices are the elements outside the solvabilizer $\sol(L)$, and two vertices are adjacent whenever they generate a solvable subalgebra. After developing the basic properties of solvabilizers and $S$-Lie algebras, we establish divisibility conditions, coset decompositions, and degree constraints for solvable graphs. Explicit examples, such as $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$, illustrate that solvable graphs may be non-connected, in sharp contrast with the group-theoretic setting. We further determine the degree sequences of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{S}(\mathfrak{gl}_2(\F_q))$ and $\Gamma_\mathfrak{S}(\mathfrak{sl}_2(\F_q))$, highlighting how spectral types of matrices dictate combinatorial patterns. An algorithmic framework based on GAP and SageMath is also provided for practical computations. Our results reveal both analogies and differences with the nilpotent graph of Lie algebras, and suggest that solvable graphs encode structural invariants in a genuinely new way. This work opens the door to a broader graphical approach to solvability in Lie theory.</description>

      <title>Some components of the moduli space of Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hochschild cohomology and the Kodaira spencer map for known families of Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four. We show that when the Kodaira Spencer map at a point is a surjection, the image of the family is a component of the moduli stack of such algebras, and when the Kodaira Spencer map is a bijection, the map to the moduli stack is generically finite. We use this to identify some components of the moduli stack.</description>

      <title>Duality for action bialgebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of linear duality on action bialgebroids (also known as smash product or scalar extension bialgebroids) and, for those bearing a quantisation nature, the effect of Drinfeld functors underlying the quantum duality principle. By means of various categorical equivalences, it is shown that any braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over any bialgebroid is also a braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over the respective dual bialgebroid. This implies that the action bialgebroid of the dual exists, which is then proven to be isomorphic, as a bialgebroid, to the dual of the initial action bialgebroid: in short, (linear) duality commutes with the action bialgebroid construction. Similarly, for quantum groupoids to which the Drinfeld duality functors apply and the quantum duality principle holds, these Drinfeld duality functors are shown to commute with the action bialgebroid construction as well.</description>

      <title>Derivation of resonance-based schemes via normal forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of resonance-based schemes via normal forms. The main idea is to use an arborification map on decorated trees together with a Butcher-Connes-Kreimer type coproduct and lower-dominant parts decompositions of the Fourier operator coming from the nonlinear interactions. This new family of low regularity schemes has explicit formulae for its coefficients and its local error. Under a mild assumption, one could expect these schemes to have a similar local error as the low regularity schemes proposed in arXiv:2005.01649.</description>

      <title>Diagonal-preserving Isomorphisms of Algebras from Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish logical equivalence between statements involving
  * the Cuntz C*-algebra $\mathcal O_\infty$ with its canonical diagonal;
  * graph C*-algebras with their canonical diagonals;
  * Leavitt path algebras over general fields with their canonical diagonals;
  * Leavitt path algebras over $\mathbb Z$;
  * topological full groups;
  * groupoids; and
  * the automorphism $x\mapsto -x$ on certain $K_0$- and homology groups equal to $\mathbb Z$
  Deciding whether these equivalent statements are true or false is of importance in studies of geometric classification of diagonal-preserving isomorphism between graph C*-algebras and Leavitt path algebras, mirroring a similar hindrance studied by Cuntz more than 40 years ago.</description>

      <title>Semibricks and wide subcategories in extended module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $d\geq 1$, we define semibricks and wide subcategories in the $d$-extended hearts of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category. We show that these semibricks are in bijection with finite-length wide subcategories. When the $d$-extended heart is the $d$-extended module category $d\mbox{-}\mathrm{mod}\Lambda$ of a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ over a field, we define left/right-finite semibricks and left/right-finite wide subcategories in $d\mbox{-}\mathrm{mod}\Lambda$ and show bijections with $(d+1)$-term simple-minded collections, generalising the bijections between $2$-term simple-minded collections, left/right-finite wide subcategories and left/right-finite semibricks in $\mathrm{mod}\Lambda$. We use a relation between semibricks and silting complexes to characterise which mutations of $(d+1)$-term silting complexes are again $(d+1)$-term.</description>

      <title>The entrywise calculus and dimension-free positivity preservers, with an Appendix on sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of a classical theme in analysis and matrix positivity: the question of which functions preserve positive semidefiniteness when applied entrywise. In addition to drawing the attention of experts such as Schoenberg, Rudin, and Loewner, the subject has attracted renewed attention owing to its connections to various applied fields and techniques. In this survey we will focus mainly on the question of preserving positivity in all dimensions. Connections to distance geometry and metric embeddings, positive definite sequences and functions, Fourier analysis, applications and covariance estimation, Schur polynomials, and finite fields will be discussed.
  The Appendix contains a mini-survey of sphere packings, kissing numbers, and their "lattice" versions. This part overlaps with the rest of the article via Schoenberg's classification of the positive definite functions on spheres, aka dimension-free entrywise positivity preservers with a rank constraint - applied via Delsarte's linear programming method.</description>

      <title>A contramodule generalization of Neeman's flat and projective module theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10928v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of arXiv:2306.02734. We consider a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the homotopy category of projective left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent to the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, and also to the homotopy category of flat cotorsion left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is contraacyclic (in the sense of Becker) if and only if it is an acyclic complex with flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles, and if and only if it is coacyclic as a complex in the exact category of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. These are contramodule generalizations of theorems of Neeman and of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <title>Branching rules for cell modules on a tower of the partition algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.03028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partition algebras with non-zero parameters are cellularly stratified and thus have the features of both cellular algebras and stratified algebras. Also, partition algebras form a tower of algebras. In this paper, we provide a diagrammatic approach to study the branching rules for cell modules on a tower of the partition algebras. This also allows us to calculate the structure constants of the Grothendieck ring of the tower.</description>

      <title>Branched It\^o formula and natural It\^o-Stratonovich isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branched rough paths, defined as paths with values in the character group of the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$, constitute integration theories that may fail to satisfy the usual integration by parts identity. Using known results on the primitive elements of $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ we can view it as a commutative cofree Hopf algebra (i.e. a commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra) and thus write an explicit change-of-variable formula for solutions to rough differential equations. This formula restricts to the well-known It\^o formula in the very special case of semimartingales. In addition, we establish an isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ and the shuffle algebra over its primitives, which extends Hoffman's exponential for the quasi-shuffle algebra, and can therefore be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of the usual It\^o-Stratonovich correction formula for semimartingales. Indeed, this can be stated as a characterisation of the algebra structure of any commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra. Compared to previous approaches, this transformation has the key property of being natural in the decorating vector space. We study the one-dimensional case more closely, by introducing the branched analogue of the Kailath-Segall polynomials and Dol\'eans-Dade exponential, and conclude with some examples of branched rough path lifts of a stochastic process which are not quasi-geometric.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a $d$-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical $d$-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>
