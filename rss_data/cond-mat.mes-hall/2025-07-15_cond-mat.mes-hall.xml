      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Tunneling spin Hall effect induced by unconventional $p$-wave magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the $p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of thermal noise on the field-driven dynamics of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the \textcolor{black}{resulting energy landscape is sensitive to} the field orientation relative to the easy axis. \textcolor{black}{In the presence of thermal noise,} the relaxation of the magnetic octupole moment in \textcolor{black}{a strained Mn$_3$Sn film} is composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>Magnon Correlation Enables Spin Injection, Dephasing, and Transport in Canted Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin transport.</description>

      <title>Magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results. Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Altermagnetism in Antiferromagnetic 2D Films via Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify 63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3 selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Vertically Coupled Double Quantum Dots Connected In Parallel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report charge transport measurements in a ring-shaped quadruple quantum dot system, composed of two vertically coupled double quantum dots connected in parallel. The vertical coupling introduces an isospin degree of freedom tied to the layer index, and the parallel configuration enables independent access to each quantum dot pair. This design allows us to observe Coulomb diamonds and evaluate the interlayer energy offset. By extending this platform to triangular and hexagonal artificial lattices, we explore correlation effects such as isospin frustration. These results highlight the system's potential for studying interaction-driven quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall-like effect for neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral systems, demonstrating that the interplay between radial electric fields and dipole moments induces exact $e^2/h$ quantization without the need for Landau levels or external magnetic fields. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our theory reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route to topological matter beyond magnetic paradigms.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Coulomb Blockade Facilitated by P-Donor Molecules in Silicon Nano-Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</description>

      <title>Learning a potential formulation for rate-and-state friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Bulk spin-orbit torque-driven spin Hall nano-oscillators using PtBi alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in $\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and 0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions. Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100 nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm) and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively. Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access memory.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $\pi$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fractional quantum Hall Liquids with a pulse at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations.

      <title>A new method to find exact solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equations: Application to derive thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.</description>

      <title>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</description>

      <title>Electrostatically Assembled Open Square and Checkerboard Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles design for strain-tunable exciton dynamics in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling exciton motion in two-dimensional semiconductors is key to unlocking new optoelectronic and straintronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their tightly bound excitons, offer an ideal platform for such control due to their strong sensitivity to local strain. Here we present an ab initio framework for modeling exciton dynamics in inhomogeneously strained WS2, combining excitonic band structures derived from first principles with a semiclassical transport model operating in both real and momentum space. By analyzing idealized strain patterns, we reveal how excitons undergo drift, diffusion, and confinement without invoking empirical parameters. Our results uncover regimes of super-ballistic propagation and negative effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. This work provides microscopic insight into strain-tunable exciton behavior and establishes design principles for engineering exciton flow in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</description>

      <title>Magnon-induced transparency of a disordered antiferromagnetic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered a planar Josephson junction which is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a thin antiferromagnetic (AFM) disordered metal film. In such a system noticeable Josephson currents may be observed, if contacts are just nanometers away from each other. It is shown that the excitation of AFM by magnons results in a strong enhancement of the stationary current through much longer junctions, whose length may be comparable to the coherence length of superconducting correlations in a nonmagnetic metal. Such a current is calculated at the weak tunneling amplitude of electrons between superconducting contacts and AFM. The problem is considered for nonequilibrium Green functions in the second-order perturbation theory with respect to the electron-magnon interaction. A spin-orbit torque oscillator was taken as a possible source of long-wavelength classic magnetic waves. This work predicts a strong effect of magnons on superconducting proximity effect in AFM, with promising applications in superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Correlating synthesis, structure and thermal stability of CuBi nanowires for spintronic applications by electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanophotonic Devices and Cavities based on a Two-Dimensional Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.</description>

      <title>Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C &gt; 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C &gt; 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C &lt; 1.</description>

Abstract: We report the development of a variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) system capable of stable and highly sensitive operation over a wide temperature range based on a GM-cooler-based cryogen-free cryostat. The system incorporates a custom-designed phase-locked loop and automatic gain control, along with passive vibration isolation, enabling precise measurements of local chemical potential even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate the performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene (MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</description>

Abstract: We explore the effect of self-orthogonality at exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian Parity-Time-symmetric systems. Using a driven three-band lattice model, we show that the Rabi frequency diverges as the system approaches an EP due to the coalescence of eigenstates. We demonstrate that this divergence manifests in experimentally accessible power oscillations, establishing a direct observable for self-orthogonality. Our results provide a pathway for probing EP physics in various metamaterial platforms.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification in a qubit-resonator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</description>

      <title>High-throughput prediction of thermodynamically stable 1D magnetic transition-metal chalcogenides and halides</title>

Abstract: The search for novel one-dimensional (1D) materials with exotic physical properties is crucial for advancing nanoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we perform a comprehensive high-throughput, first-principles study to explore the vast landscape of 1D transition-metal chalcogenides and halides. Starting with 6,832 candidate structures derived from 28 metals and 8 non-metals, we systematically evaluated their thermodynamic stability by comparing the formation energies of 1D chains against competing 2D phases, mimicking thermodynamic selectivity during nucleation. This screening identified 210 stable 1D magnetic chains. Furthermore, representation learning models revealed that chemical stoichiometry and the electron affinity of the non-metal element are key factors governing 1D stability. The stable materials exhibit a rich spectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic chains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent phenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe. Finally, our findings propose concrete platforms for quantum applications, such as the predicted realization of Majorana zero modes in a ferromagnetic CrCl2 chain on a superconducting NbSe2 substrate.</description>

      <title>Graphene Design with Parallel Cracks: Abnormal Crack Coalescence and Its Impact on Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a material with potential applications in electric, thermal, and mechanical fields, and has seen significant advancements in growth methods that facilitate large-scale production. However, defects during growth and transfer to other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene. Surprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can enhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further research is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure and affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we investigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on the mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by distances ($W_\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings reveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two existing crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks, $W_\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As $W_\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak stress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress intensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with increasing $W_\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\text{gap}$ induces a transition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent propagation with intercrack undulation. This shift in fracture behavior demonstrates a brittle-to-ductile transition, as evidenced by increased energy absorption and delayed failure. A design guideline for the initial crack geometry is suggested by correlating peak stress with the $W_\text{gap}$, within a certain range.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of the valley density and its implications for the observation of the valley Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the conservation of the valley density in multivalley insulators is broken in an unexpected way by the electric field that drives the valley Hall effect. This implies that time-reversal-invariant fully gapped insulators, in which no bulk or edge state crosses the Fermi level, can support a valley Hall current in the bulk and yet show no valley density accumulation at the edges. Thus, the valley Hall effect cannot be observed in such systems. If the system is not fully gapped then valley density accumulation at the edges is possible. The accumulation has no contribution from undergap states and can be expressed as a Fermi surface average, for which we derive an explicit formula. We demonstrate the theory by calculating the valley density accumulations in an archetypical valley-Hall insulator: a gapped graphene nanoribbon. Surprisingly, we discover that a net valley density polarization is dynamically generated for certain edge terminations.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intrinsic electronic structure and complex fermiology of YRu2Si2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a detailed study of the intrinsic electronic structure of YRu2Si2 employing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT) based firstprinciples calculations. Electrical and magnetic measurements were conducted on well-oriented highquality single crystals. Bulk physical measurements indicate that the compound exhibits slightly enhanced Pauli paramagnetic behavior, accompanied by electrical transport properties reminiscent of metals. Our ARPES data reveal four fold symmetric Fermi surface with weakly-dispersing bands around the N point originating from Ru d orbitals. We observed the anisotropic characteristics of the band near the N point, showing weak dispersion in the XNX direction and minimal dispersion along the NGN direction. The electronic band structure near the Fermi level is primarily governed by the Ru d orbital, with minor contributions from the Y d and Si p orbitals. Polarization-dependent ARPES results indicate the multi-band and multi-orbital band-character of YRu2Si2. Due to the negligible correlation effect, the observed ARPES data is found to be in good agreement with the DFT results.</description>

      <title>A unified realization of electrical quantities from the quantum International System of Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</description>

Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the Fermi surface in the layered Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$. We probed the magnetization, magnetic torque and magnetoresistance in high-quality single crystals. Pronounced Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) and de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are observed in magnetic fields above 3T and at temperatures of up to 22K. Multiple fundamental frequencies and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three crystallographic axes and the planes in between. Our investigation can confirm the density functional theory (DFT) calculated band structure and its corresponding Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a well-established probe for spatial symmetries of crystalline samples, mainly exploiting the well-defined mapping between the diffraction groups (symmetry group of CBED patterns) and the point-group symmetries of the crystalline sample. In this work, we extend CBED to determine magnetic point groups. We construct all magnetic CBED groups, of which there exist 125. Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization. Based on its feasibility using existing technology, as well as on its accuracy, high spatial resolution, and small required sample size, magnetic CBED promises to be become a valuable alternative method for magnetic structure determination.</description>

Abstract: Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the long-standing trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has limited their practical applications. We present DeePTB-NEGF, an integrated framework combining deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian prediction with non-equilibrium Green's Function methodology to enable accurate quantum transport simulations in open boundary conditions with 2-3 orders of magnitude acceleration. We demonstrate DeePTB-NEGF through two challenging applications: comprehensive break junction simulations with over $10^4$ snapshots, showing excellent agreement with experimental conductance histograms; and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FET) at experimental dimensions, reproducing measured transfer characteristics for a 41 nm channel CNT-FET ($\sim 8000$ atoms, $3\times10^4$ orbitals) and predicting zero-bias transmission spectra for a 180 nm CNT ($\sim 3\times 10^4$ atoms, $10^5$ orbitals), showcasing the framework's capability for large-scale device simulations. Our systematic studies across varying geometries confirm the necessity of simulating realistic experimental structures for precise predictions. DeePTB-NEGF bridges the longstanding gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a scalable tool for high-throughput and large-scale quantum transport simulations that enables previously inaccessible nanoscale device investigations.</description>

      <title>Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by the interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1\textdegree\ hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3\textdegree, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37\textdegree\ twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moir\'e cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands over unusually large ranges of density. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of behavior commonly seen in magic-angle samples near integer filling at low magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a novel approach to engineering large voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) and enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface of single-layer graphene (SLG) and NiFe (Py) through non-covalent functionalization with Platinum (II) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin (Pt-porphyrin). Using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown SLG, we demonstrate that Pt-porphyrin functionalization significantly increases the SOC and enables robust voltage modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy, as confirmed by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJ/(V-m)) is achieved, accompanied by an order-of-magnitude enhancement in spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) compared to pristine SLG. The resonance field exhibits a clear, reversible shift under applied gate voltage, confirming robust electric-field modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the structural integrity and effective charge transfer at the functionalized interface. Electrical characterization of back-gated graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) further reveals tunable electronic properties upon functionalization. Our results establish functionalized graphene/ferromagnet interfaces as a promising platform for low-power, voltage-controlled spintronic devices, paving the way for scalable, energy-efficient memory and logic technologies</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation for many-body systems: Derivation based on the Lieb-Robinson bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) quantum master equation is a powerful tool for the study of open quantum many-body systems. However, its microscopic derivation applicable to many-body systems is available only in limited cases of weak internal couplings, and it has yet to be fully understood under what microscopic conditions the local GKSL equation is valid. We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</description>

      <title>Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha &gt;D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha &gt; 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains L\'{e}vy diffusion for $\alpha &lt; 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha &gt; D$.</description>

      <title>Ballistic electron transport described by a fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non-parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler (Lent and Kirkner in J Appl Phys 67:6353, 1990; Ben Abdallah et al. in ZAMP 48:135-155, 1997; Ben Abdallah in J. Math. Phys. 41:4241-4261, 2000), where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated, and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the second-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the effective mass approximation.</description>

      <title>Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Ferroelastic Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>
