      <title>Anderson localization of quantum droplets in disordered potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Anderson localization of a one-dimensional quantum droplet in a speckle-like potential employing the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We compute the droplet width, density profiles, diffusion exponent and coefficient, and the localization length for both small and large droplets. Interesting classes of anomalous diffusions are obtained in transport dynamics ranging from superdiffusion to subdiffusion for a strong disorder strength. We find that above a certain critical disorder strength the droplet exhibits a transition to Anderson localization. Our results can be redibly probed with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics for artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields. The topological similarities between ANNs and Ising-type models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, reveal shared structures that bridge statistical physics and machine learning. In this perspective, we explore how concepts and methods from statistical physics, particularly those related to glassy and disordered systems like spin glasses, are applied to the study and development of ANNs. We discuss the key differences, common features, and deep interconnections between spin glasses and neural networks while highlighting future directions for this interdisciplinary research. Special attention is given to the synergy between spin-glass studies and neural network advancements and the challenges that remain in statistical physics for ANNs. Finally, we examine the transformative role that quantum computing could play in addressing these challenges and propelling this research frontier forward.</description>

      <title>Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.</description>

      <title>Edge-Aware Graph Attention Model for Structural Optimization of High Entropy Carbides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting relaxed atomic structures of chemically complex materials remains a major computational challenge, particularly for high-entropy systems where traditional first-principles methods become prohibitively expensive. We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the interaction between exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor quantum well, embedded in a microcavity, in the presence of disorder. The disorder acts on the excitons in the semiconductor quantum well. We have calculated the exciton and polariton self-energies and the exciton and polariton energy dispersion relations in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that disorder increases the polariton-polariton interaction.</description>

      <title>Entropic Confinement and Mode Connectivity in Overparameterized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes.</description>

      <title>Localization, transport, flux induced extended modes and mobility edge in a self-similar corral substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address that a single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on a self-similar corral substrate can give rise to a set of non-diffusive localized modes that follow the same hierarchical distribution. As the lattice, the spatial extent of quantum prison containing a cluster of atomic sites is dependent on the generation of fractal structure. Apart from the quantum imprisonment of the excitation, a magnetic flux threading each elementary plaquette is shown to destroy the boundedness and generate an absolutely continuous sub-band populated by resonant eigen functions. Flux induced engineering of quantum states is corroborated through the evaluation of inverse participation ratio and quantum transport. Moreover, the robustness of the extended states has been checked in presence of diagonal disorder and off-diagonal anisotropy. Flux modulated single-particle mobility edge is characterized through mutlifractal analysis. Quantum interference is the essential issue, reported here, that manipulates the kinematics of the excitation and this is manifested by the workout of persistent current.</description>

      <title>Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Controllable Emergence of Multiple Topological Anderson Insulator Phases in Photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pauli Master Equation numerical analysis of coherent and incoherent dressed fermions in triplet unconventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two types of dressed fermions in a triplet superconductor with an in-situ disorder effective field. They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and versatile tool for the analysis of critical and low-temperature phase states in spin system models. The problem of calculating the dependence of the average energy on the spatial distribution of exchange integrals for the Edwards-Anderson model on a square lattice with frustrated interactions is considered. We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--H\"{a}nchen shifts at the edge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between a Coulomb impurity and quasiholes in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at finite temperatures. While a repulsive impurity can pin a quasihole and stabilize the FQH state, an attractive impurity cannot bind quasiholes. We demonstrate that at finite temperatures, a quasihole can be thermally ionized from a repulsive impurity, resulting in an ionization phase transition. We propose an experimental setup using exciton sensing to detect such a thermal ionization of quasiholes.</description>

      <title>Trapped Fermions Through Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ans\"atze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ans\"atz without biasing the method.</description>

      <title>Generalized Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.</description>

      <title>Solving Sudoku using oscillatory neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the capabilities of physical computing with Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. To solve Sudokus with ONNs, we define a novel mapping strategy that utilizes the unique characteristics of the computation paradigm. The problem is encoded through a puzzle specific graph-embedding, which implements the constraints through different subgraphs. These subgraphs are then combined into a single adjacency matrix, which allows the natural dynamics of the phases of coupled oscillators to find a solution to the puzzle. We model the phase dynamics of the ONN by means of the Kuramoto differential equation. This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach. The simulation results show that the novel ONN mapping outperforms the established HNN methodology.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Control of Non-Hermitian Skin Modes via Disorder and An Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains a significant challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices by combining disorder with a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. In nonreciprocal lattices, when the nonreciprocal hopping is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides wave-packet propagation and produces boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientation between the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping direction, the boundary localization position can be continuously and arbitrarily controlled. We further demonstrate distinct geometry-dependent manipulation of skin modes in reciprocal lattices, where controllable boundary localization emerges solely from the lattice geometry. These results establish a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Fast training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Hexatic Phase in Covalent Two-Dimensional Silver Iodide</title>

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some two-dimensional systems. In this study, we imaged silver iodide embedded in multilayer graphene using time- and temperature-resolved in situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observed the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</description>

      <title>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-induced quantum phases offer the potential for simple and powerful tuning of material properties. For example, simply illuminating 2D materials in the integer quantum Hall regime with polarized light is predicted to drive quantum phase transitions. Such phenomena are largely beyond the current frontier of solid state experiments due to technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report results of such an experiment. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in anomalous polarization-dependent subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</description>
