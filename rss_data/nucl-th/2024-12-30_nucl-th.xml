      <title>Strongly interacting matter in extreme magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are ubiquitous across different physical systems of current interest; from the early Universe, compact astrophysical objects and heavy-ion collisions to condensed matter systems. A proper treatment of the effects produced by magnetic fields during the dynamical evolution of these systems, can help to understand observables that otherwise show a puzzling behavior. Furthermore, when these fields are comparable to or stronger than \Lambda_QCD, they serve as excellent probes to help elucidate the physics of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density. In this work we provide a comprehensive review of recent developments on the description of QED and QCD systems where magnetic field driven effects are important. These include the modification of meson static properties such as masses and form factors, the chiral magnetic effect, the description of anomalous transport coefficients, superconductivity in extreme magnetic fields, the properties of neutron stars, the evolution of heavy-ion collisions, as well as effects on the QCD phase diagram. We describe recent theory and phenomenological developments using effective models as well as LQCD methods. The work represents a state-of-the-art review of the field, motivated by presentations and discussions during the "Workshop on Strongly Interacting Matter in Strong Electromagnetic Fields" that took place in the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*) in the city of Trento, Italy, September 25-29, 2023.</description>

      <title>Effects of chiral symmetry restoration on dilepton production in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of their weak interactions with the strongly interacting matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, dileptons provide an ideal probe of the early dynamics of these collisions. Here, we study dilepton production using a partonic transport model that is based on an extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In this model, the in-medium quark masses decrease with increasing temperature as a result of the restoration of chiral symmetry. We find that the extracted temperature from dileptons of intermediate masses agrees well with the temperature of the partonic matter, suggesting that dilepton production can be used as a thermometer for the produced partonic matter. Our results also indicate that the extracted in-medium quark masses decrease with increasing dilepton temperature, implying that dilepton production can further serve as a probe of chiral symmetry restoration in high energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Deformation and core$+n$ decoupling in the spectrum of $^{17}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of various structures, such as diverse shapes and cluster structures, is a fundamental property of atomic nuclei. In neutron-rich nuclei, a core$+n$ structure can compete with nuclear deformation due to the small neutron separation energy. A neutron-rich carbon isotope, $^{17}$C, exemplifies the appearance of the deformation and the core+$n$ decoupling in its spectrum, which is desirable for a deeper understanding of the coexistence phenomena in neutron-rich nuclei. We aim to describe and understand this coexistence phenomenon in the low-lying levels of $^{17}$C in a unified manner considering explicitly the degrees of freedom of both the quadrupole deformation and the relative motion between a $^{16}$C core and a valence neutron. Method: We adopt the generator coordinate method (GCM) with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) to describe various configurations. We superpose various basis wave functions generated by the energy variation by imposing two types of constraints: the $\beta$-$\gamma$ and the $d$ constraints, which control the degree of the quadrupole deformation and the relative motion between a $^{16}$C core and a valence neutron, respectively. We find that the experimental energy level is well reproduced by the present method, including both deformed and $^{16}$C+$n$ configurations. The ground $3/2^{+}$ and second excited $5/2^{+}$ states exhibit a triaxially deformed shape, while the main component of the first excited $1/2^{+}$ state is a $^{16}$C($0^{+}$) core plus an $s$-wave neutron configuration. The tail of the valence neutron is significantly improved by including the $^{16}$C+$n$ basis functions explicitly. The explicit inclusion of both the quadrupole deformation and the relative motion between a core and a valence neutron is essential to describe the coexistence phenomena observed in neutron-rich nuclei in the AMD+GCM framework.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear density profiles to reveal particle-hole configurations in the island of inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In the mass regions with an abnormal shell structure, the so-called ``island of inversion," the spin-parity of odd-mass nuclei provides quantitative insights into the shell evolution. However, the experimental determination of the spin-parity is often challenging, leaving it undetermined in many nuclei. Purpose: We discuss how the shell structure affects the density profiles of nuclei in the island of inversion and investigate whether these can be probed from the total reaction and elastic scattering cross sections. Method: The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) is employed to generate various particle-hole configurations and predict the energy levels of these nuclei. The obtained density distributions are used as inputs to the Glauber model, which is employed to calculate the total reaction and elastic scattering cross sections for revealing their relationship to the particle-hole configurations. Results: In addition to the well-known correlation between nuclear deformation and radius, we show the correlations between the particle-hole configurations and both central density and diffuseness. We show that different particle-hole configurations are well reflected in the total reaction and elastic scattering cross sections. Conclusion: The total reaction and elastic scattering cross sections are useful probes to identify the spin-parity of nuclei when different particle-hole configurations coexist.</description>

      <title>Probing medium response via strangeness enhancement around quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet-induced medium excitation is a crucial part of jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and has recently been confirmed by experiment for the first time. Based on the AMPT model simulation, we propose the strangeness enhancement around quenched jets as a novel signature of jet-induced medium excitation. By applying the jet-particle correlation techniques, we calculate jet-induced particle yields around the jets and find a significant enhancement of the strange-to-non-strange-hadron ratio and the double-to-single-strange-hadron ratio correlated with jets in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions relative to proton-proton collisions. This enhancement increases with both the strength of jet-QGP interactions and the radial distance from jet axis. These observations align with the features of jet-induced medium excitation and parton coalescence in hadron formation, and await experimental validation in the future measurements.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dineutrons on nuclear compositions and neutrino reactions of the core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions and neutrino reaction rates in the central region of the core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100 ms after core bounce, $^2n$ and $^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 km and 50 km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of $^2n$ and $^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100 km reduces. Hence, the neutrino absorption and antineutrino emission rates decrease by approximately 40%-50%. Conversely, those of protons, deuterons, and $^4He$ increase, leading to the increase in the neutrino emission and antineutrino absorption rates by approximately eight times within a radius of 100 km.</description>

      <title>The consistent analyses for determination of the point-nucleon distributions by electron and proton scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron scattering cross section, as well as proton scattering cross section, observes the point-proton and the point-neutron distributions, but both cross sections are not able to determine them separately. If they are analyzed consistently with each other, there is a possibility to determine them with less ambiguity.The consistency can be examined through the moments of the charge distribution, which linearly depend on the moments of the point-proton and -neutron distributions.</description>

      <title>Application of normalizing flows to nuclear many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body perturbation theory provides a powerful framework to study the ground state and thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter as well as associated single-particle potentials and response functions within a systematic order-by-order expansion. However, computational challenges can emerge beyond the lowest orders of perturbation theory, especially when computing both single-particle potentials and response functions, which in general are complex-valued and require Cauchy principal value calculations of high-dimensional integrals. We demonstrate that normalizing flows are suitable for Monte Carlo importance sampling of both regular and irregular functions appearing in nuclear many-body calculations. Normalizing flows are a class of machine learning models that can be used to build and sample from complicated distributions through a bijective mapping from a simple base distribution. Furthermore, a well-trained model for a certain target integrand can be efficiently transferred to calculate related integrals with varying physical conditions. These features can enable more efficient tabulations of nuclear physics inputs to numerical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers across varying physical conditions and nuclear force models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we compare the SuSAv2 model, based on the superscaling phenomenon and the relativistic mean field theory, with charged-current inclusive neutrino cross sections from the NOvA and MicroBooNE experiments, whose targets are composed primarily by 12 C and 40 Ar, respectively. The neutrino energy in these experiments covers a kinematic range from tens of MeV to roughly 20 GeV. Thus, we consider the different reaction mechanisms that contribute significantly to these kinematics, namely quasielastic, two-particle two-hole meson exchange currents, resonances and deep inelastic scattering contributions.</description>

      <title>Excitation of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance using 6Li inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incompressibility of infinite nuclear matter (K_\infty) is a parameter in the description of the nuclear equation of state that governs the energy cost associated with density oscillations near the saturation density. The most direct experimental method for studying this property of infinite nuclear matter is to probe the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) in finite nuclei. This work explores the use of 6Li as a probe to study the ISGMR in several stable nuclei: 58Ni, 90Zr, 116Sn, and 208Pb, as complementary to using inelastic scattering of {\alpha}-particles, which has been used to great effect over the last several decades. Elastic and inelastic scattering data for these targets were collected with 343-MeV 6Li beams. In all nuclei studied in this work, the ISGMR strength distributions extracted from multipole decomposition analyses of the inelastic scattering spectra agree very well with the previously measured ISGMR responses from {\alpha}-particle scattering, establishing the feasibility of employing 6Li inelastic scattering in investigations of the ISGMR.</description>

      <title>Phase and equation of state of finite density QC$_2$D at lower temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures, $T = 40$ MeV ($32^4$ lattice) and $T = 80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed. By performing $T = 40$ MeV simulations, essentially similar results to the previous ones at $T = 80$ MeV are obtained, but several finer understandings are achieved. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to smaller statistical errors. This talk is mainly based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv}. It also includes related studies and subsequent developments that were not mentioned in the original papers.</description>

      <title>Towards factorization with emergent scales for jets in dense media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the recently developed open quantum system Effective Field Theory framework, we investigate jet production and evolution in a dense nuclear medium in electron-ion/heavy-ion collisions. We confirm that the frequent monitoring of the jet by the medium leads to the emergence of a perturbative transverse momentum scale, often referred to as the saturation scale that necessitates further factorization to completely isolate the non-perturbative physics of the medium. A part of this goal is achieved in this paper by providing an operator definition for the broadening probability of a gluon in the medium within the Markovian approximations. We show that this distribution is (semi)universal; it depends on the angular measurement on the jet and probes both the large and small $x$ dynamics of the medium. We further elucidate all other contributions to non-perturbative physics suggesting that the parameterization of non-perturbative physics is more complex than previously assumed and outline steps required for a complete factorization of the jet production cross section.</description>

Abstract: We compute the $00$ element of the spin density matrix, denoted as $\rho_{00}$ and called the spin alignment, up to the second order of the gradient expansion in local equilibrium by Zubarev's approach. In the first order, we obtain $\rho_{00}=1/3$, meaning that the contributions from thermal vorticity and shear stress tensor are vanishing. The non-vanishing contributions to $\rho_{00}-1/3$ appear in the second order of gradients in the Belinfante and canonical cases. We also discuss the properties of the spin density matrix under the time reversal transformation. The effective transport coefficient for the spin alignment induced by the thermal shear stress tensor is T-odd in the first order, implying that the first order effect is dissipative.</description>

      <title>Vector and Tensor Spin Polarization for Vector Bosons at Local Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive expressions for the vector and tensor components of the spin polarization of massive vector bosons at local thermodynamic equilibrium up to second order in the space-time gradients of the thermodynamic fields pertaining to the canonical stress-energy tensor and spin tensor of the free Proca field. A set of Feynman rules is devised to calculate the Wigner function and the matrix-valued spin-dependent distribution (MVSD) functions order by order in space-time gradients. Due to constraints imposed by time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment - defined as the 00-component of the tensor polarization - arises from second-order terms in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We discuss the physical meaning of different contributions to vector and tensor polarization. These formulae provide a prediction of a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with the observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the partial decay widths of a spin-parity resonance $J^P=3/2^-$ $N^*$ with a mass of $\simeq$ 2070 MeV obtained from the coupled channel s wave vector-baryon $\rho N$, $\omega N$, $\phi N$, $K^*\Lambda$ and $K^*\Sigma$ dynamics. This state, which couples strongly to the $K^*\Sigma$ channel, corresponds to a nucleon with a hidden strange quark content, in analogy to the $P_c$ states discovered by the LHCb collaboration, and we denote it as $P_s(2080)$. A state with such a nature can decay to vector-baryon, pseudoscalar-baryon, and pseudoscalar-baryon resonance channels, involving triangular loops in the latter two cases. As we will show, the partial decay widths to pseudoscalar-baryon resonance channels, like $\pi N^*(1535)$, $\pi N^*(1650)$, $K\Lambda(1405)$, are comparable to those related to ground state baryons in the final state, like $\pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$. In this way, reactions involving such lighter baryon resonances in the final state can be used as an alternative source of information on the properties of a $N^*$ with hidden strangeness.</description>

      <title>Composite nature of the $T_{cc}$ state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, LHCb collaboration reported a very narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum just below the $D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold. We consider the influence of the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole in the scattering amplitude to derive a general treatment for the two-body final state interaction near its threshold. The line shape (or the energy dependent event distribution) are then obtained, where the parameters can be fixed by fitting to the experimental data on the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum. Within our method the data are quite well reproduced. The pole structure in the complex energy plane indicates the bound state structure of the $T_{cc}$ state. The compositeness as a measure of molecule component in its hadron wave function is predicted to be $0.23_{-0.09}^{+0.40}$. The non-molecular component, e.g., the compact tetraquark also takes a non-negligible portion.</description>

      <title>Hard Photon Triggered Jets in $p$-$p$ and $A$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An investigation of high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$) photon triggered jets in proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and ion-ion ($A$-$A$) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2$ and $5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ is carried out, using the multistage description of in-medium jet evolution. Monte Carlo simulations of hard scattering and energy loss in heavy-ion collisions are performed using parameters tuned in a previous study of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for inclusive jets and high-$p_T$ hadrons. We obtain a good reproduction of the experimental data for photon triggered jet $R_{AA}$, as measured by the ATLAS detector, the distribution of the ratio of jet to photon $p_T$ ($X_{\rm J \gamma}$), measured by both CMS and ATLAS, and the photon-jet azimuthal correlation as measured by CMS. We obtain a moderate description of the photon triggered jet $I_{AA}$, as measured by STAR. A noticeable improvement in the comparison is observed when one goes beyond prompt photons and includes bremsstrahlung and decay photons, revealing their significance in certain kinematic regions, particularly at $X_{J\gamma} &gt; 1$. Moreover, azimuthal angle correlations demonstrate a notable impact of non-prompt photons on the distribution, emphasizing their role in accurately describing experimental results. This work highlights the success of the multistage model of jet modification to straightforwardly predict (this set of) photon triggered jet observables. This comparison, along with the role played by non-prompt photons, has important consequences on the inclusion of such observables in a future Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Impact of intrinsic electromagnetic structure on the nuclear charge radius in relativistic density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the effects of the nucleon's intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) structure on the nuclear charge radius have been explored within the framework of the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory. It is found that the intrinsic EM structure corrections could make an effect for accurately describing the evolution of nuclear charge radius. After taking into account the intrinsic EM structure corrections, the descriptions of the evolution of charge radii for Pb, Sn, and Cd isotopes have been improved within relativistic density functional theory. Using the Pb isotopic chain as an example, the improvement in charge radii can be primarily attributed to the intrinsic neutron and neutron spin-orbit terms of the intrinsic EM structure. Additionally, nuclear charge densities and corresponding isotopic evolution in Pb isotopes have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent relativistic mean-field model for $ \Xi^{-} $ hypernuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hypernuclear systems, interactions involving nucleons and hyperons are intricately influenced by the surrounding particles, particularly by the density and the isospin feature of the nuclear medium. In this work, the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory is adopted to describe the structure of several typical $\Xi^{-}$ hypernuclei. New sets of $\Xi N$ effective interactions, by taking a density-dependent meson-nucleon/hyperon coupling perspective, are developed by fitting experimental data on the $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon $1s$ and $1p$ state separation energy of $^{15}_{\Xi^{-}}$C as well as the $1p$ state separation energy of $^{13}_{\Xi^{-}}$B. The density-dependent behavior of meson-hyperon coupling strengths sensitively affects the description of hyperon single-particle levels. In fact, the density-dependent meson-baryon coupling strengths introduce additional rearrangement contributions to the hyperon self-energy. Correspondingly, detailed forms of density dependence in these coupling strengths and different considerations of meson-baryon coupling channels will impact the hyperon single-particle properties within hypernuclei. Especially with the additional inclusion of the isovector scalar $ \delta $ meson, the significant enhancement of rearrangement terms in the effective interaction DD-ME$\delta$ impacts the shape of the hyperon potential and alters the characteristics of the isovector channel dynamics balance in the effective nuclear force. Relevant research underscores the importance of precisely accounting for in-medium effects in hyperon-nucleon interactions and incorporating a more comprehensive set of meson-exchange degrees of freedom in effective nuclear forces, offering a potential solution for more self-consistently describing the featured hyperon single-particle behavior of various hypernuclei and for reducing uncertainties in theoretical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Deformed natural orbitals for ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of ab initio nuclear structure methods towards doubly open-shell nuclei, heavy nuclei and greater accuracy occurs at the price of evermore increased computational costs, especially RAM and CPU time. While most of the numerical simulations are carried out by expanding relevant operators and wave functions on the spherical harmonic oscillator basis, alternative one-body bases offering advantages in terms of computational efficiency have recently been investigated. In particular, the so-called natural basis used in combination with symmetry-conserving methods applicable to doubly closed-shell nuclei has proven beneficial in this respect. The present work examines the performance of the natural basis in the context of symmetry-breaking many-body calculations enabling the description of superfluid and deformed open-shell nuclei at polynomial cost with system's size. First, it is demonstrated that the advantage observed for closed-shell nuclei carries over to open-shell ones. A detailed investigation of natural-orbital wave functions provides useful insight to support this finding and to explain the superiority of the natural basis over alternative ones. Second, it is shown that the use of natural orbitals combined with importance-truncation techniques leads to an even greater gain in terms of computational costs. The presents results pave the way for the systematic use of natural-orbital bases in future implementations of non-perturbative many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Robust ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of E2 and radius observables. I. Electric quadrupole moments and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converged results for E2 observables are notoriously challenging to obtain in ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) approaches. Matrix elements of the E2 operator are sensitive to the large-distance tails of the nuclear wave function, which converge slowly in an oscillator basis expansion. Similar convergence challenges beset ab initio prediction of the nuclear charge radius. However, we exploit systematic correlations between the calculated E2 and radius observables to yield meaningful predictions for relations among these observables. In particular, we examine ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of the form Q/r^2, for nuclei throughout the $p$ shell. Meaningful predictions for electric quadrupole moments may then be made by calibrating to the ground-state charge radius, if experimentally known, or vice versa. Moreover, these dimensionless ratios provide ab initio insight into the nuclear quadrupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Particle Monopole Form Factors with Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body approaches with modern nuclear forces are challenged by the recent experimental measurement of the monopole form factor of the $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition in the $\alpha$ particle [Kegel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 152502 (2023)]. We investigate the elastic and inelastic $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition form factors using the ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM). We observe a good convergence of both form factors with respect to the basis size employing the Daejeon16 nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction. Our NCSM results are very close to the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic calculations using $NN$ plus three-nucleon interactions based on the chiral effective field theory which take into account the continuum effects via the Lorentz integral transform. The significant difference between the ab initio results with various modern nuclear interactions and of some of them with the recent experimental data provides motivations for deeper investigation of this observable.</description>

Abstract: Using effective Lagrangians constrained by the heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, for the light quarks, we analyze the $D^0 D^0\pi^+$, $\bar{D}^0D^0\pi^0$ and $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ invariant mass spectra. Performing a simultaneous analysis of the doubly charmed and charm-anti-charm states gives further insights into the nature of the $T^+_{cc}$ and $\chi^0_{c1}(3872)$, exotic hadrons. It is confirmed that both states should lie below their respective $DD^*$/$D\bar{D}^*$ thresholds. Also, the contributions of the triangle and box diagrams are negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasifragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Effect of chiral imbalance on the electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter using Green-Kubo Method within the 2-flavour gauged NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green-Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the $2\to2$ scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.</description>
