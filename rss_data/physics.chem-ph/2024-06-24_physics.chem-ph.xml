      <title>Exploring electron affinities, LUMO energies, and band gaps with electron-pair theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the electron attachment equation-of-motion pair coupled cluster doubles (EA-EOM-pCCD) ansatz, which allows us to inexpensively compute electron affinities, energies of unoccupied orbitals, and electron attachment spectra. We assess the accuracy of EA-EOM-pCCD for a representative data set of organic molecules for which experimental data is available, as well as the electron attachment process in uranyl dichloride. EA-EOM-pCCD provides more reliable energies for the LUMO than its ionization potential EOM counterpart for the HOMO. The advantage of EA-EOM-pCCD is demonstrated for rylene and rylene diimide units of different chain lengths, where the differences between theoretical and experimental EAs approach chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Extending GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Integrals in the TeraChem Software Package to f Type Orbitals: Implementation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The resulting code is very efficient, and we demonstrate this with density functional theory calculations on increasingly large alkanes as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems.</description>

      <title>O -Acetylated sugars in the gas phase: stability, migration, positional isomers and conformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-acetylations are functional modifications which can be found on different hydroxyl groups of glycans and which contribute to the fine tuning of their biological activity. Localizing the acetyl modifications is notoriously challenging in glycoanalysis, in particular because of their mobility: loss or migration of the acetyl group may occur through the analytical workflow. Whereas migration conditions in the condensed phase have been rationalized, little is known about the suitability of Mass Spectrometry to retain and resolve the structure of O-acetylated glycan isomers. Here we use the resolving power of infrared ion spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculation to assess the structure of O-acetylated monosaccharide ions in the gaseous environment of a mass analyzer. N-acetyl glucosamines were synthetized with an O-acetyl group in positions 3 or 6, respectively. The protonated ions produced by electrospray ionization were observed by mass spectrometry and their vibrational fingerprints were recorded in the 3 $\mu$m range by IRMPD spectroscopy (InfraRed Multiple Photon Dissociation). Experimentally, the isomers show distinctive IR fingerprints. Additionally, ab initio calculations confirm the position of the O-acetylation and resolve their gas phase conformation. These findings demonstrate that the position of O-acetyl groups is retained through the transfer from solution to the gas phase, and can be identified by IRMPD spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Rapid IRMPD analysis for glycomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared vibrational spectroscopy in the gas phase has emerged as a powerful tool to determine complex molecular structures with Angstrom accuracy. Among the different approaches IRMPD (InfraRed Multiple Photon Dissociation), which requires the use of an intense pulsed tunable laser in the IR domain, has been broadly applied to the study of complex (bio)molecules. Recently, it also emerged as a highly relevant approach for analytical purposes especially in the field of glycomics in which structural analysis is still a tremendous challenge. This opens the perspective to develop new analytical tools allowing for the determination of molecular structures with atomic precision, and to address advanced questions in the field. However, IRMPD experiments require either non commercial equipments and long acquisition time which limits the data output. Here we show that it is possible to improve the IRMPD performances by optimizing the combination between a LTQ XL mass spectrometer and a high repetition tunable laser Firefly. Two orders of magnitude are gained with this approach compared to usual experiments ultimately leading to a completely resolved spectrum acquired in less than one minute. These results open the way to many new applications in glycomics with the possibility to include IRMPD in complex analytical workflows.</description>

      <title>Phase-field simulations opening new horizons in corrosion research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work overviews a new, recent success of phase-field modelling: its application to predicting the evolution of the corrosion front and the associated structural integrity challenges. Despite its important implications for society, predicting corrosion damage has been an elusive goal for scientists and engineers. The application of phase-field modelling to corrosion not only enables tracking the electrolyte-metal interface but also provides an avenue to explicitly simulate the underlying mesoscale physical processes. This lays the grounds for developing the first generation of mechanistic corrosion models, which can capture key phenomena such as film rupture and repassivation, the transition from activation- to diffusion-controlled corrosion, interactions with mechanical fields, microstructural and electrochemical effects, intergranular corrosion, material biodegradation, and the interplay with other environmentally-assisted damage phenomena such as hydrogen embrittlement.</description>

      <title>Towards polaritonic molecular orbitals for large molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive theoretical understanding of electron-photon correlation is essential for describing the reshaping of molecular orbitals in quantum electrodynamics (QED) environments. The strong coupling QED Hartree-Fock (SC-QED-HF) theory tackles these aspects by providing consistent molecular orbitals in the strong coupling regime. The previous implementation, however, has significant convergence issues that limit the applicability. In this work we introduce two second-order algorithms that significantly reduce the computational requirements, thereby enhancing the modeling of large molecular systems in QED environments. Furthermore, the implementation will enable the development of correlated methods based on a reliable molecular orbital framework.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Response of Ionic Current in Conical Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic current rectification (ICR) of charged conical nanopores has various applications in fields including nanofluidics, bio-sensing, and energy conversion, whose function is closely related to the dynamic response of nanopores. The occurrence of ICR originates from the ion enrichment and depletion in conical pores, whose formation is found to be affected by the scanning rate of voltages. Here, through time-dependent simulations, we investigate the variation of ion current under electric fields and the dynamic formation of ion enrichment and depletion, which can reflect the response time of conical nanopores. The response time of nanopores when ion enrichment forms i.e. at the on state is significantly longer than that with the formation of ion depletion i.e. at the off state. Our simulation results reveal the regulation of response time by different nanopore parameters including the surface charge density, pore length, tip, and base radius, as well as the applied conditions such as the voltage and bulk concentration. The response time of nanopores is closely related to the surface charge density, pore length, voltage, and bulk concentration. Our uncovered dynamic response mechanism of the ionic current can guide the design of nanofluidic devices with conical nanopores, including memristors, ionic switches, and rectifiers.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Simulation of Two-Dimensional Fluorescence-Excitation Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence-excitation (2D-FLEX) spectroscopy is a recently proposed nonlinear femtosecond technique for the detection of photoinduced dynamics. The method records a time-resolved fluorescence signal in its excitation- and detection-frequency dependence, and hence combines the exclusive detection of excited state dynamics (fluorescence) with signals resolved in both excitation and emission frequencies (2D electronic spectroscopy). In this work, we develop an on-the-fly protocol for the simulation of 2D-FLEX spectra of molecular systems, which is based on interfacing the classical doorway-window representation of spectroscopic responses with trajectory surface hopping simulations. Applying this methodology to the gas-phase pyrazine, we show that femtosecond 2D-FLEX spectra can deliver detailed information otherwise obtainable via attosecond spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of a potential biological magnetic field sensor: radical pair mechanism in flavin adenine dinucleotide biradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) on its own might be able to act as a biological magnetic field sensor. Motivated by these observations, in this study, we develop a detailed quantum theoretical model for the radical pair mechanism (RPM) for the flavin adenine biradical within the FAD molecule. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the distance between the radicals on FAD, which we then feed into a quantum master equation treatment of the RPM. In contrast to previous semi-classical models which are limited to the low-field and high-field cases, our quantum model can predict the full magnetic field dependence of the transient absorption signal. Our model's predictions are consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Priors for Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers currently rely on a hybrid quantum-classical approach known as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to solve problems. Still, there are several challenges with VQAs on the classical computing side: it corresponds to a black-box optimization problem that is generally non-convex, the observations from the quantum hardware are noisy, and the quantum computing time is expensive. The first point is inherent to the problem structure; as a result, it requires the classical part of VQAs to be solved using global optimization strategies. However, there is a trade-off between cost and accuracy; typically, quantum computers return a set of bit strings, where each bitstring is referred to as a shot. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing (QC) necessitates many shots to measure the circuit accurately. Since QC time is charged per shot, reducing the number of shots yields cheaper and less accurate observations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using basic Bayesian optimization (BO) methods to globally optimize quantum circuit parameters. This work proposes two modifications to the basic BO framework to provide a shot-efficient optimization strategy for VQAs. Specifically, we provide a means to place a prior on the periodicity of the rotation angles and a framework to place a topological prior using few-shot quantum circuit observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through an ablation study, showing that using both proposed features statistically outperforms a standard BO implementation within VQAs for computational chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in 3D photoelectron momentum spectroscopy as precursory methods for dichroic and enantiosensitive measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) are measured from an atomic target ionized by ultrafast, elliptical fields of opposite handedness. Comparing these PADs to one another and to numeric simulations, a difficult to avoid systematic error in their orientation is identified and subsequently corrected by imposing the dichroic symmetry by which they are necessarily related. We show that this correction can be directly applied to molecular targets in the same fields. This paves the way for measurement of enantiosensitive information which has yet to be accessed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals represent a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), enabling accurate predictions of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties.</description>

      <title>The Wetting of H$_2$O by CO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biphasic interfaces are complex but fascinating regimes that display a number of properties distinct from those of the bulk. The CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, in particular, has been the subject of a number of studies on account of its importance for the carbon life cycle as well as carbon capture and sequestration schemes. Despite this attention, there remain a number of open questions on the nature of the CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface, particularly concerning the interfacial tension and phase behavior of CO$_2$ at the interface. In this paper, we seek to address these ambiguities using ab initio-quality simulations. Harnessing the benefits of machine-learned potentials and enhanced statistical sampling methods, we present an ab initio-level description of the CO$_2$-H$_2$O interface. Interfacial tensions are predicted from 1-500 bar and found to be in close agreement with experiment at the pressures for which experimental data is available. Structural analyses indicate the build-up of an adsorbed, saturated CO$_2$ film forming at low pressure (20 bar) with properties similar to those of the bulk liquid, but preferential perpendicular alignment with respect to the interface. CO$_2$ monolayer build-up coincides with a reduced structuring of water molecules close to the interface. This study highlights the predictive nature of machine-learned potentials for complex macroscopic properties of biphasic interfaces, and the mechanistic insight obtained into carbon dioxide aggregation at the water interface is of high relevance for geoscience, climate research, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Computing hydration free energies of small molecules with first principles accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free energies play a central role in characterising the behaviour of chemical systems and are among the most important quantities that can be calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of hydration in particular is a well-studied physicochemical property of drug-like molecules and is commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy method compatible with MLPs, enabling, for the first time, calculations of biomolecular free energy with \textit{ab initio} accuracy. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MACE model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the hydration free energies of organic molecules.</description>

Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Anti-Coulomb ion-ion interactions: a theoretical and computational study</title>

Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the "anti-Coulomb" interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>
