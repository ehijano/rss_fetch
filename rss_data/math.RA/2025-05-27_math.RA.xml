      <title>A New Characterization of Semi-Tripotent Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive study of the so-called \textit{semi-tripotent rings} obtaining their new and non-trivial characterization as well as a complete description in terms of sums and products of some special elements. Particularly, we explore in-depth when a group ring is semi-tripotent. Our results somewhat supply those established by Ko$\c{s}$an et al. in Can. Math. Bull. (2019).</description>

      <title>On Strongly $\Delta$-Clean Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores in-depth the structure and properties of the so-called {\it strongly $\Delta$-clean rings}, that is a novel class of rings in which each ring element decomposes into a sum of a commuting idempotent and an element from the subset $\Delta(R)$. Here, $\Delta(R)$ stands for the extension of the Jacobson radical and is defined as the maximal subring of $J(R)$ invariant under the unit multiplication. We present a systematic framework for these rings by detailing their foundational characteristics and algebraic behavior under standard constructions, as well as we explore their key relationships with other well-established ring classes. Our findings demonstrate that all strongly $\Delta$-clean rings are inherently strongly clean and $\Delta U$, but under centrality constraints they refine the category of uniquely clean rings. Additionally, we derive criteria for the strong $\Delta$-clean property in triangular matrix rings, their skew analogs, trivial extensions, and group rings. The analysis reveals deep ties to boolean rings, local rings, and quasi-duo rings by offering new structural insights in their algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isotropy groups of derivations on the Quantum Plane $K_q[x, y]$, defined by the relation $yx = qxy$, where $q \in K^*$, with $q^2\neq 1$. The main goal is to determine the automorphisms of the Quantum Plane that commutes with a fixed derivation $\delta$. We describe conditions under which the isotropy group $\text{Aut}_\delta(A)$ is trivial, finite, or infinite, depending on the structure of $\delta$ and whether $q$ is a root of unity: additionally, we present the structure of the group in the finite case. A key tool is the analysis of polynomial equations of the form $\mu_1^a \mu_2^b = 1$, arising from monomials in the inner part of $\delta$. We also make explicit which finite subgroups of $\text{Aut}(K_q[x, y])$ are isotropy groups of some derivation: either $q$ root of unity or not. Techniques from algebraic geometry, such as intersection multiplicity, are also employed in the classification of the finite case.</description>

      <title>Quasi-triangular Novikov bialgebras and related bialgebra structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of quasi-triangular Novikov bialgebras, which constructed from solutions of the Novikov Yang-Baxter equation whose symmetric parts are invariant. Triangular Novikov bialgebras and factorizable Novikov bialgebras are important subclasses of quasi-triangular Novikov bialgebras. A factorizable Novikov bialgebra induces a factorization of the underlying Novikov algebra and the double of any Novikov bialgebra naturally admits a factorizable Novikov bialgebra structure. Moreover, we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter Novikov algebras and show that there is an one-to-one correspondence between factorizable Novikov bialgebras and quadratic Rota-Baxter Novikov algebras of nonzero weights. Finally, we obtain that the Lie bialgebra induced by a Novikov bialgebra and a quadratic right Novikov algebra is quasi-triangular (resp. triangular, factorizable) if the Novikov bialgebra is quasi-triangular (resp. triangular, factorizable), and under certain conditions, the Novikov bialgebra induced by a differential infinitesimal bialgebra is quasi-triangular (resp. triangular, factorizable) if the differential infinitesimal bialgebra is quasi-triangular (resp. triangular, factorizable).</description>

      <title>Stratified Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the concept of Stratified Algebra, a new algebraic framework equipped with a layer-based structure on a vector space. We formalize a set of axioms governing intra-layer and inter-layer interactions, study their implications for algebraic dynamics, and present concrete matrix-based models that satisfy different subsets of these axioms. Both associative and bracket-sensitive constructions are considered, with an emphasis on stratum-breaking propagation and permutation symmetry. This framework proposes a paradigm shift in the way algebraic structures are conceived: instead of enforcing uniform global rules, it introduces stratified layers with context-dependent interactions. Such a rethinking of algebraic organization allows for the modeling of systems where local consistency coexists with global asymmetry, non-associativity, and semantic transitions.</description>

      <title>Irreducible cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-modules from finite-dimensional modules over the minimal nilpotent finite $W$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A weight $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module with finite-dimensional weight spaces is called a cuspidal module, if every root vector of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ acts injectively on it. In \cite{LL}, it has been shown that any block with a generalized central character of the cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-module category is equivalent to a block of the category of finite-dimensional modules over the minimal nilpotent finite $W$-algebra $W(e)$ for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$. In this paper, using a centralizer realization of $W(e)$ and an explicit embedding $W(e)\rightarrow U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we show that every finite-dimensional irreducible $W(e)$-module is isomorphic to an irreducible $W(e)$-quotient module of some finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. As an application, we can give very explicit realizations of all irreducible cuspidal $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$-modules using finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-modules, avoiding using the twisted localization method and the coherent family introduced in \cite{M}.</description>

      <title>Formalizing a classification theorem for low-dimensional solvable Lie algebras in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalization, in the theorem prover Lean, of the classification of solvable Lie algebras of dimension at most three over arbitrary fields. Lie algebras are algebraic objects which encode infinitesimal symmetries, and as such ubiquitous in geometry and physics. Our work involves explicit calculations on the level of the underlying vector spaces and provides a use case for the linear algebra and Lie theory routines in Lean's mathematical library mathlib. Along the way we formalize results about Lie algebras, define the semidirect product within this setting and add API for bases of vector spaces. In a wider context, this project aims to provide a complete mechanization of a classification theorem, covering both the statement and its full formal proof, and contribute to the development and broader adoption of such results in formalized mathematics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Homogeneous Derivations of Graded Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel concept in graded rings called generalized homogeneous derivations, which serve as a natural generalization of the homogeneous derivations introduced by Kanunnikov. We establish the specialized notion of gr-generalized derivations, a subclass that preserves the degree of homogeneous elements. We extend several significant results, originally established for prime rings, to the context of gr-prime rings. Furthermore, we characterize when gr-semiprime rings contain non-trivial central graded ideals. Additionally, we examine the algebraic and module-theoretic structure of these maps, establish their functorial properties, and construct categorical frameworks that capture their derivation structures in both the ring and module contexts.</description>

      <title>Topological Koszulity for Category Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a topological description of Ext groups between simple representations of categories via a nerve type construction. We use it to show that the Koszulity of indiscretely based category algebras is equivalent to the locally bouquet property of this nerve. We also provide a class of functors which preserve the Koszulity of category algebras called almost discrete fibrations. Specializing from categories to posets, we show that the equivalence relations of V. Reiner and D. Stamate in arXiv:0904.1683 [math.AC] are exactly almost discrete fibrations and recover their results. As an application, we classify when a shifted dual collection to a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles on a toric variety is strong.</description>

Abstract: We construct a triangulated equivalence between the derived categories of quasi-coherent and contraherent $\mathcal A$-modules for a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra $\mathcal A$ over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$. The sheaf of rings of differential operators $\mathcal D$ (or fiberwise differential operators for a smooth morphism of schemes) is the thematic example of a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra.</description>
