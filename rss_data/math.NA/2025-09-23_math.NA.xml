      <title>Nonlocal modeling of spatial fractional diffusion with truncated interaction domains and truncated kernel function singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are in ubiquitous, very effective use to model diffusion processes. However, there are many applications (e.g., such as in hydrology, animal foraging, biology, and light diffusion just do name a few) for which results obtained through the use of parabolic PDEs do not agree with observations. In many situations the use of fractional diffusion models has been found to be more faithful to that which is observed. Specifically, we replace the Laplacian operator in the PDE by a fractional Laplacian operator ${\mathcal L}$ which is an integral operator for which solutions are sought for on all of space, has an unbounded domain of integration, and for a given point $x$ the integrand contains a kernel function $\phi(y-x)$ that is infinite whenever $y=x$.
  These three features pose impediments not only for the construction of efficient discretization methods but also because all three involve one or more sort of "infinity''. To overcome these impediments we choose to invoke one or more of the following strategies. (a) We seek solutions only within a chosen bounded domain $\Omega$. (b) For every $x\in\Omega$, we choose a bounded domain of integration such as, e.g., an Euclidean ball $B_\delta(x)$ having finite radius $\delta$. (c) We truncate the singularity of $\phi(y-x)$ by setting, for a given constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $\phi(y-x)= \phi(\varepsilon)$ whenever $|y-x|\le\varepsilon$.
  We then provide extensive illustrations of the possible combinations chosen from among (a), (b), and (c). We also illustrate, for the various models defined for each of these combinations, their limiting behavior of solutions such as showing that as $\delta\to0$ we recover the PDE model and also showing that in the limit of some other parameters we recover the fractional Laplacian model.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation of the stationary Navier-Stokes problem with non-smooth data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyze the finite element approximation of the stationary Navier-Stokes equations with non-smooth Dirichlet boundary data. The discrete approximation is obtained by considering the Navier-Stokes system with a regularized boundary solution. Based on the existence of the very weak solution for the Navier-Stokes system with L2 boundary data, and a suitable decomposition of this solution, we obtain a priori error estimates between the approximation of the Navier-Stokes system with non-smooth data and the finite element solution of the associated regularized problem. These estimates allow us to conclude that our approach converges with optimal order.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling of Selective Capture Mechanisms in Conduction System Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CSP is gaining clinical significance owing to its ability to restore a physiological activation sequence in the ventricles. While His bundle pacing (HBP) producing the most physiological activation is preferable, due to implant complications the selective activation of the LBB by left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is considered an alternative, offering both a simpler implant and a physiological activation sequence. However, the physical mechanisms facilitating selective activation of the LBB remain poorly understood. We developed a structurally and biophysically detailed computer model of the IVS and LBB to quantitatively elucidate the role of lead position, orientation and polarity in achieving optimal s-LBBP thresholds, using a geometrically detailed model of a clinically widely used CSP lead. A deep implant within the LV sub-endocardium ensuring a direct contact between electrode and LBB is key for effective s-LBBP. For low strength s-LBBP is feasible, but capturing the LBB in its entirety could only be achieved using higher strengths that led to non-selective left bundle branch pacing (ns-LBBP). Switching the tip polarity to anodal was not beneficial, requiring higher strengths to activate the LBB. Lead orientation relative to the LBB bundles was found to influence the s-LBBP capture threshold and the number of synchronously activating bundles. The model explains the impedance trends that are clinically observed when advancing the tip through the IVS into the LBB region, as well as sudden impedance drops associated with implant complications such as septal perforation or lead dislodgement. Quantitative consistence with clinically observed trends support model credibility, and indicate that simulation may offer an effective approach for guiding the design of improved CSP leads, facilitating a selective and synchronous activation of the entire LBB.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate computation of classical Gaussian quadratures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for computing classical Gaussian quadrature rules (Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-Laguerre, and Gauss-Hermite) are presented, based on globally convergent fourth-order iterative methods and asymptotic approximations, which are applied in complementary regions of the parameter space. The combination of these approaches results in methods that surpass previous algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational range (practically unrestricted). The Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto variants are also considered, along with the computation of the associated barycentric weights. Arbitrary accuracy algorithms are also provided for the symmetric cases (Gauss-Gegenbauer and Gauss-Hermite).</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of the Weighted Frobenius Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a weighted Frobenius loss for approximating symmetric positive definite matrices in the context of preconditioning iterative solvers. Unlike the standard Frobenius norm, the weighted loss penalizes error components associated with small eigenvalues of the system matrix more strongly. Our analysis reveals that each eigenmode is scaled by the corresponding square of its eigenvalue, and that, under a fixed error budget, the loss is minimized only when the error is confined to the direction of the largest eigenvalue. This provides a rigorous explanation of why minimizing the weighted loss naturally suppresses low-frequency components, which can be a desirable strategy for the conjugate gradient method. The analysis is independent of the specific approximation scheme or sparsity pattern, and applies equally to incomplete factorizations, algebraic updates, and learning-based constructions. Numerical experiments confirm the predictions of the theory, including an illustration where sparse factors are trained by a direct gradient updates to IC(0) factor entries, i.e., no trained neural network model is used.</description>

      <title>Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A decoupled and structure-preserving direct discontinuous Galerkin method for the Keller-Segel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel numerical scheme to solve the classical Keller--Segel (KS) model which simultaneously preserves its intrinsic mathematical structure and achieves optimal accuracy. The model is reformulated into a gradient flow structure using the energy variational method, which reveals the inherent energy dissipative dynamics of the system. Based on this reformulation, we construct a structure-preserving discretization by semi-implicit method in time and the direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) method in space, resulting in a stable and high-order accurate approximation. The proposed scheme enjoys several desirable properties: (i) energy stability, ensuring discrete free energy dissipation; (ii) exact conservation of mass for the cell density; (iii) positivity preservation of the numerical cell density, enforced via a carefully designed limiter; and (iv) optimal convergence rate, with first-order accuracy in time and $(k+1)$-th order accuracy in space for polynomials of degree $k$. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis that substantiate these properties. In addition, extensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problems exhibiting pattern formation and near blow-up behavior, are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method. The approach offers a flexible and reliable framework for structure-preserving numerical simulation of chemotaxis models and other gradient flow-type systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Reconstruction of Coefficients in Elliptic Equations Using Continuous Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical reconstruction of the spatially dependent conductivity coefficient and the source term in elliptic partial differential equations of in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and given interior observation of the solution. Using data assimilation, some approximated gradients of our error functional are derived to update the reconstructed coefficients, and new $L^2$ error estimates for such minimization formulations are given for the spatially discretized reconstructions. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method and demonstrate the error estimates. The numerical results also show that the reconstruction is very robust for the error in certain inputted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Dual Norms for Minimal Residual Finite Element Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal-residual methods for PDEs with a residual in a dual space are non-trivial to guarantee stability. We present a minimal-residual finite element method in which the solution space is a standard finite element space, but neural networks are used as test functions for the evaluation of residual dual norms. The use of a neural network improves the approximation of the residual representer, and thereby improves the stability of the method. Our hybrid approach is implemented through a deep residual Uzawa algorithm that alternates finite element updates with neural network training. We prove consistency and convergence results for the Uzawa methodology. We also prove an a priori error estimate that relies on a suitable Fortin compatibility condition. Numerical experiments on advection-reaction problems with singular or discontinuous data show that the proposed framework delivers robust and accurate approximations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale solution decomposition of nonlocal-in-time problems with application in numerical computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a multiscale solution decomposition (MSD) method for nonlocal-in-time problems to separate a series of known terms with multiscale singularity from the original singular solution such that the remaining unknown part becomes smoother. We demonstrate that the MSD provides a scenario where the smoothness assumption for solutions of weakly singular nonlocal-in-time problems, a commonly encountered assumption in numerous literature of numerical methods that is in general not true for original solutions, becomes appropriate such that abundant numerical analysis results therein become applicable. From computational aspect, instead of handling solution singularity, the MSD significantly reduces the numerical difficulties by separating and thus circumventing the solution singularity. We consider typical problems, including the fractional relaxation equation, Volterra integral equation, subdiffusion, integrodifferential equation and diffusion-wave equation, to demonstrate the universality of MSD and its effectiveness in improving the numerical accuracy or stability in comparison with classical methods.</description>

      <title>Admissible convergence behavior and mirroring of stagnation in restarted (block) GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe how to construct matrices and block right-hand sides the exhibit a specified restarted block GMRES convergence pattern, such that the eigenvalues and Ritz values at each iteration can be chosen independent of the specified convergence behavior. This work is a generalization of the work in [Meurant and Tebbens, Num. Alg. 2019] in which the authors do the same for restarted non-block GMRES. We use the same tools as were used in [Kub\'inov\'a and Soodhalter, SIMAX 2020], namely to analyze block GMRES as an iteration over a right vector space with scalars from the $^\ast$-algebra of matrices. To facilitate our work, we also extend the work of Meurant and Tebbens and offer alternative proofs of some of their results, that can be more easily generalized to the block setting.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient Kernel Methods for Learning Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describe a wide range of physical systems. As such, data-driven simulations of Hamiltonian systems are important for many scientific and engineering problems. In this work, we propose kernel-based methods for identifying and forecasting Hamiltonian systems directly from data. We present two approaches: a two-step method that reconstructs trajectories before learning the Hamiltonian, and a one-step method that jointly infers both. Across several benchmark systems, including mass-spring dynamics, a nonlinear pendulum, and the Henon-Heiles system, we demonstrate that our framework achieves accurate, data-efficient predictions and outperforms two-step kernel-based baselines, particularly in scarce-data regimes, while preserving the conservation properties of Hamiltonian dynamics. Moreover, our methodology provides theoretical a priori error estimates, ensuring reliability of the learned models. We also provide a more general, problem-agnostic numerical framework that goes beyond Hamiltonian systems and can be used for data-driven learning of arbitrary dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On efficient block Krylov-solvers for $\mathcal H^2$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical matrices provide a highly memory-efficient way of storing dense linear operators arising, for example, from boundary element methods, particularly when stored in the H^2 format. In such data-sparse representations, iterative solvers are preferred over direct ones due to the cost-efficient matrix-vector multiplications they enable. Solving multiple systems of linear equations with the same hierarchical matrix naturally leads to block methods, which in turn make heavy use of BLAS level-3 functions such as GEMM. We present an efficient implementation of H^2-matrix-vector and H^2-matrix-matrix multiplication that fully exploits the potential of modern hardware in terms of memory and cache utilization. The latter is employed to accelerate block Krylov subspace methods, which we present later as the main results of this paper.</description>

      <title>A two-grid method with dispersion matching for finite-element Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is about a new two-level solver for Helmholtz equations discretized by finite elements. The method is inspired by two-grid methods for finite-difference Helmholtz problems as well as by previous work on two-level domain-decomposition methods. For the coarse-level discretization, a compact-stencil finite-difference method is used that minimizes dispersion errors. The smoother involves a domain-decomposition solver applied to a complex-shifted Helmholtz operator. Local Fourier analysis shows the method is convergent if the number of degrees of freedom per wavelength is larger than some lower bound that depends on the order, e.g. more than 8 for order 4. In numerical tests, with problem sizes up to 80 wavelengths, convergence was fast, and almost independent of problem size unlike what is observed for conventional methods. Analysis and comparison with dispersion-error data shows that, for good convergence of a two-grid method for Helmholtz problems, it is essential that fine- and coarse-level dispersion relations closely match.</description>

      <title>Robust spectral preconditioning for high-P\'{e}clet number convection-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-level hybrid restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner for heterogeneous steady-state convection-diffusion equations at high P\'{e}clet numbers. Our construction builds on the multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM), wherein the coarse space is spanned by locally optimal basis functions obtained from local generalized eigenproblems on operator-harmonic spaces. Extending the theory of Ma (2025) to convection-diffusion problems in conservation form, we establish exponential convergence of the MS-GFEM approximation. Rewriting MS-GFEM as a RAS-type iteration, we show for coercive problems that this exponential convergence property is inherited by the RAS-type iterative method (at least in the continuous setting). Employed as a preconditioner within the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), the resulting method requires only a few iterations for high accuracy even with low-dimensional coarse spaces.
  Through extensive numerical experiments on problems with high-contrast diffusion and non-divergence-free, rotating velocity fields, we demonstrate robustness with respect to the grid P\'{e}clet number and the number of subdomains (tested up to $10^5$ subdomains), while coarse-space dimensions remain small as grid P\'{e}clet numbers increase. By adapting the coarse space and oversampling size, we are able to achieve arbitrarily fast convergence of preconditioned GMRES. As an extension, for which we do not have theory yet, we show effectiveness of the method even for indefinite problems and in the vanishing-diffusion limit.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for the Inverse Robin Problem with Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse Robin problem covers the determination of the Robin parameter in an elliptic partial differential equation posed on a domain $\Omega$. Given the solution of the Robin problem on a subdomain $\omega \subset \Omega$ together with the elliptic problem's right hand sides, the aim is to solve this inverse Robin problem numerically. In this work, a computational method for the reconstruction of the Robin parameter inspired by a unique continuation method is established. The proposed scheme relies solely on first-order Lagrange finite elements ensuring a straightforward implementation. Under the main assumption that the Robin parameter is in a finite dimensional space of continuously differentiable functions it is shown that the numerical method is second order convergent in the finite element's mesh size. For noisy data this convergence rate is shown to hold true until the noise term dominates the error estimate. Numerical experiments are presented that highlight the feasibility of the Robin parameter reconstruction and that confirm the theoretical convergence results numerically.</description>

      <title>A posteriori existence for the Keller-Segel model via a finite volume scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two forms of conditional a posteriori error estimates for a finite volume scheme approximating the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system. The estimates control the error in the $L^\infty(0,T, L^2(\Omega))$- and $L^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$-norm and exhibit linear convergence in the mesh size, as observed in numerical experiments. Crucially, we show that as long as the condition of the error estimate is satisfied a weak solution exits. This means, as long as the numerical solution has good properties, we can rigorously infer existence of an exact solution.</description>

      <title>Schrodingerization based quantum algorithms for the time-fractional heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum algorithm for solving high-dimensional time-fractional heat equations. By applying the dimension extension technique from [CS07], the $d+1$-dimensional time-fractional equation is reformulated as a local partial differential equation in $d+2$ dimensions. Through discretization along both the extended and spatial domains, a stable system of ordinary differential equations is obtained by a simple change of variables. We propose a quantum algorithm for the resulting semi-discrete problem using the Schrodingerization approach from [JLY24a,JLY23,JL24a]. The Schrodingerization technique transforms general linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrodinger-type systems--with unitary evolution, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This is accomplished via the warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. We provide detailed implementations of this method and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis, demonstrating up to exponential advantage--with respect to the inverse of the mesh size in high dimensions~--~compared to its classical counterparts. Specifically, to compute the solution to time $T$, while the classical method requires at least $\mathcal{O}(N_t d h^{-(d+0.5)})$ matrix-vector multiplications, where $N_t $ is the number of time steps (which is, for example, $\mathcal{O}(Tdh^{-2})$ for the forward Euler method), our quantum algorithms requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^2d^4 h^{-8})$ queries to the block-encoding input models, with the quantum complexity being independent of the dimension $d$ in terms of the inverse mesh size $h^{-1}$. Numerical experiments are performed to validate our formulation.</description>

      <title>Solving time-fractional diffusion equations with Robin boundary conditions via fractional Hamiltonian boundary value methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel numerical scheme for solving time-fractional reaction-diffusion problems with Robin boundary conditions, where the time derivative is in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved. Our proposed method is based on the spectral collocation method in space and Fractional Hamiltonian boundary value methods in time. For the considered spectral collocation method, the basis functions used are not the standard polynomial basis functions, but rather adapt to Robin boundary conditions, and the exponential convergence property is provided. The proposed procedure achieves spectral accuracy in space and is also capable of getting spectral accuracy in time. Some numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Scott-Vogelius element and iterated penalty method for inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quasi-optimal a priori error estimates for general mixed finite element methods to approximate solutions of the Stokes problem subject to inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the Scott-Vogelius element this yields pressure-robust a priori error estimates. Due to the exact divergence constraint, this requires a compatibility condition for the boundary data to hold. A key tool is a modified Fortin operator, capable of preserving this compatibility condition. Furthermore, we analyse the iterated penalty method, a Uzawa-type algorithm and we show its convergence and asymptotic pressure robustness. Numerical experiments support the theory and highlight the importance of the compatibility condition and the appropriate treatment of nearly singular vertices.</description>

      <title>Local Characterization of Noise in Iterative Reconstruction of the Generalized Radon Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study noise in iterative reconstruction from discrete noisy data of a generalized Radon transform in the plane. Our approach builds on Local Reconstruction Analysis (LRA), a framework for analyzing reconstructions at the native scale. We establish that the rescaled reconstruction error converges in distribution to a zero-mean Gaussian random field with explicitly computable covariance, providing a complete local characterization of noise in iterative reconstruction. Numerical experiments show strong agreement with the theoretical predictions. Combined with earlier deterministic results, our findings complete the analysis of iterative reconstruction at the native scale with respect to the two most fundamental limitations: the discreteness of the data and the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>An adaptive Hermite spectral method for the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive Hermite spectral method for the three-dimensional velocity space of the Boltzmann equation guided by a newly developed frequency indicator. For the homogeneous problem, the indicator is defined by the contribution of high-order coefficients in the spectral expansion. For the non-homogeneous problem, a Fourier-Hermite scheme is employed, with the corresponding frequency indicator formulated based on distributions across the entire spatial domain. The adaptive Hermite method includes scaling and p-adaptive techniques to dynamically adjust the scaling factor and expansion order according to the indicator. Numerical experiments cover both homogeneous and non-homogeneous problems in up to three spatial dimensions. Results demonstrate that the scaling adaptive method substantially reduces L2 errors at negligible computational cost, and the p-adaptive method achieves time savings of up to 74%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational methods are intended to time integrate linear homogeneous problems. However, their scope can be extended so as to cover linear nonhomogeneous problems. In this paper the integration of semilinear problems is considered. The resulting procedure requires the same computational cost than the one of a linked Runge--Kutta method, with the advantage that the order reduction phenomenon is avoided. Some numerical illustrations are included showing the predicted behaviour of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpolation of Rigid Body Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of interpolating a rigid body motion is to find a spatial trajectory between a prescribed initial and terminal pose. Two variants of this interpolation problem are addressed. The first is to find a solution that satisfies initial conditions on the k-1 derivatives of the rigid body twist. This is called the kth-order initial value trajectory interpolation problem (k-IV-TIP). The second is to find a solution that satisfies conditions on the rigid body twist and its k-1 derivatives at the initial and terminal pose. This is called the kth-order boundary value trajectory interpolation problem (k-BV-TIP). Solutions to the k-IV-TIP for k=1,...,4, i.e. the initial twist and up to the 4th time derivative are prescribed. Further, a solution to the 1-IV-TBP is presented, i.e. the initial and terminal twist are prescribed. The latter is a novel cubic interpolation between two spatial configurations with given initial and terminal twist. This interpolation is automatically identical to the minimum acceleration curve when the twists are set to zero. The general approach to derive higher-order solutions is presented. Numerical results are shown for two examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems \(Ax = y\) is central to a variety of practically important fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. The most successful and theoretically best-understood method is convex variational regularization, where approximate but stable solutions are defined as minimizers of \( \|A(\cdot) - y^\delta\|^2 / 2 + \alpha \mathcal{R}(\cdot)\), with \(\mathcal{R}\) a regularization functional. Recent methods such as deep equilibrium models and plug-and-play approaches, however, go beyond variational regularization. Motivated by these innovations, we introduce implicit non-variational (INV) regularization, where approximate solutions are defined as solutions of \(A^*(A x - y^\delta) + \alpha R(x) = 0\) for some regularization operator \(R\). When the regularization operator is the gradient of a functional, INV reduces to classical variational regularization. However, in methods like DEQ and PnP, \(R\) is not a gradient field, and the existing theoretical foundation remains incomplete. To address this, we establish stability and convergence results in this broader setting, including convergence rates and stability estimates measured via a absolute Bregman distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations containing memory terms that depend nonlinearly on past states model a variety of non-Markovian processes. In this study, we present a Markovian embedding procedure for such equations with distributed delay by utilising an exact spectral representation of the nonlinear memory function. This allows us to transform the nonlocal system to an equivalent local-in-time system in an abstract extended space. We demonstrate our embedding procedure for two one-dimensional physical models: (i) the walking droplet and (ii) the single-phase Stefan problem. In addition to providing an alternative representation of the underlying physical system, the local representation finds applications in designing efficient time-integrators with time-independent computational costs for memory-dependent systems which typically suffer from growing-in-time costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mass- and modified energy-conservative relaxation Crank-Nicolson finite element method for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation. Utilizing only a single auxiliary variable, we simultaneously reformulate the distinct nonlinear terms present in both the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the Poisson equation into their equivalent expressions, constructing a system equivalent to the original Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation. Our proposed scheme, derived from this equivalent system, is implemented linearly, avoiding the need for iterative techniques to solve the nonlinear equation. Additionally, it is executed sequentially, eliminating the need to solve a coupled large linear system. We in turn rigorously derive the optimal error estimates for the proposed scheme, demonstrating second order accuracy in time and $(k+1)$th order accuracy in space when employing polynomials of degree up to $k$. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method and emphasize its conservation properties over long-time simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive stochastic extended iterative method, which can be viewed as an improved extension of the randomized extended Kaczmarz (REK) method, for finding the unique minimum Euclidean norm least-squares solution of a given linear system. In particular, we introduce three equivalent stochastic reformulations of the linear least-squares problem: stochastic unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and the stochastic multiobjective optimization problem. We then alternately employ the adaptive variants of the stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHBM) method, which utilize iterative information to update the parameters, to solve the stochastic reformulations. We prove that our method converges $R$-linearly in expectation, addressing an open problem in the literature related to designing theoretically supported adaptive SHBM methods. Numerical experiments show that our adaptive stochastic extended iterative method has strong advantages over the non-adaptive one.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent successful application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Boltzmann-type equations [S. Jin, Z. Ma, and K. Wu, J. Sci. Comput., 94 (2023), pp. 57], we provide a rigorous error analysis for PINNs in approximating the solution of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian. The challenge arises from the nonlocal quadratic interaction term defined in the unbounded domain of velocity space. Analyzing this term on an unbounded domain requires the inclusion of a truncation function, which demands delicate analysis techniques. As a generalization of this analysis, we also provide proof of the asymptotic preserving property when using micro-macro decomposition-based neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quaternion tensor low rank Quaternion tensor low-rank approximation using a family of non-convex norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approaches for low rank approximation of quaternion tensors \cite{chen2019low,zhang1997quaternions,hamilton1866elements}. The first method uses quasi-norms to approximate the tensor by a low-rank tensor using the QT-product \cite{miao2023quaternion}, which generalizes the known L-product to N-mode quaternions. The second method involves Non-Convex norms to approximate the Tucker and TT-rank for the completion problem. We demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively approximate the tensor compared to the convexifying of the rank, such as the nuclear norm. We provide theoretical results and numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the proposed methods in the Inpainting and Denoising applications.</description>

      <title>PACMANN: Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, available adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been reported to scale poorly in terms of computational cost when applied to high-dimensional problems. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). PACMANN incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the PINN loss function, that is, the squared PDE residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration into existing physics-informed neural network pipelines. The code is available at https://github.com/CoenVisser/PACMANN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning based partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers have received great attention in recent years. Most progress in this area has been driven by deep neural networks such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and kernel method. In this paper, we introduce a random feature based framework toward efficiently solving PDEs. Random feature method was originally proposed to approximate large-scale kernel machines and can be viewed as a shallow neural network as well. We provide an error analysis for our proposed method along with comprehensive numerical results on several PDE benchmarks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art solvers that face challenges with a large number of collocation points, our proposed method reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, the implementation of our method is simple and does not require additional computational resources. Due to the theoretical guarantee and advantages in computation, our approach is proven to be efficient for solving PDEs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating singular and near-singular integrals on $C^2$ smooth surfaces with quadratic geometric approximation and closed form expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most Fredholm integral equations involve integrals with weakly singular kernels. Once the domain of integration is discretized into flat triangular elements, these weakly singular kernels become strongly singular or near-singular. Common methods to compute these integrals when the kernel is a Green's function include the Duffy transform, polar coordinates with closed analytic formulas, and singularity extraction. However, these methods do not generalize well to the normal derivatives of Green's functions due to the strongly singular behavior of these functions on triangular elements. We provide methods to integrate both the Green's function and its normal derivative on smooth surfaces discretized by triangular elements in three dimensions for many commonly encountered differential operators. For strongly singular integrals involving normal derivatives of Green's functions, we introduce a more refined approximation of the derivatives of the Green's function on flat triangles. This method uses geometric information of the true surface of integration to approximate the original integral on the true domain using push-forward maps. This is better than simply setting the singular integrals to zero, while being faster than adaptive refinement methods. We provide an algorithm for explicit computations on triangles, and present necessary analytic formulas that the algorithm requires in the appendix.</description>

      <title>A Nonconforming Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problems on Locally Anisotropic Meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new nonconforming \(P_1\) finite element method for elliptic interface problems. The method is constructed on a locally anisotropic mixed mesh, which is generated by fitting the interface through a simple connection of intersection points on an interface-unfitted background mesh, as introduced in \cite{Hu2021optimal}. We first establish interpolation error estimates on quadrilateral elements satisfying the regular decomposition property (RDP). Building on this, the main contribution of this work is a novel consistency error analysis for nonconforming elements, which removes the quasi-regularity assumption commonly required in existing approaches. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods with Multiquadric and Inverse Multiquadric Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, a family of two- and three-stage explicit multiquadric (MQ) and inverse multiquadric (IMQ) radial basis functions (RBFs) Runge-Kutta methods are introduced for solving ordinary differential equations. These methods are developed by utilizing MQ- and IMQ-RBF Euler methods. The main advantage of these RBF-based methods lies in their ability to achieve a one-order higher accuracy than their classical Runge-Kutta counterparts without increasing the number of stages. This improvement is made possible by incorporating RBF corrections, where the optimal shape parameter is determined through the local truncation error analysis of the proposed schemes. Convergence and stability analyses, including the study of stability regions, are presented to illustrate how these methods compare with standard Runge-Kutta schemes. Numerical experiments on five benchmark problems further confirm predicted accuracy and stability, demonstrating that MQ- and IMQ-based RBF Runge-Kutta methods provide an alternative to conventional low-stage explicit RungeKutta schemes.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>

      <title>A class of flexible and efficient partitioned Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for some time-dependent partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) can be transformed into an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) containing moderately stiff and non-stiff terms after spatial semi-discretization. In the present paper, we construct a new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods for the above ODEs. We treat the moderately stiff term with an s-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method and treat the non-stiff term with a 4m-stage explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Different from several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods that employ fixed-stage RK methods to handle the non-stiff term, both the parameters $s$ and $m$ in our methods can be flexibly adjusted as needed for the problems. This feature endows our methods with superior flexibility and applicability compared to several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods, as demonstrated in several specific numerical examples (including the advection-diffusion equations, the Burgers equations, the Brusselator equations and the damped wave equations).</description>

      <title>Computing the Zeros of a Holomorphic Function Using Quadrature-Based Subdivision and Rational Approximation of the Logarithmic Derivative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method that uses AAA approximation to reliably compute all the zeros of a holomorphic function in a specified search region in the complex plane. Specifically, the method is based on rational approximation of the logarithmic derivative in combination with subdivision of the search region based on Cauchy's argument principle. This is motivated by the fact that, while it is straightforward to compute the zeros of a AAA rational approximation, there is no guarantee that all of the zeros of the function being approximated will be found. Many of the ideas presented are also applicable to computing both the zeros and the poles of a meromorphic function. A implementation of the method is provided by the Python package skzeros.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</description>

      <title>Chordal-NMF with Riemannian Multiplicative Update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is the problem of approximating a given nonnegative matrix M through the product of two nonnegative low-rank matrices W and H. Traditionally NMF is tackled by optimizing a specific objective function evaluating the quality of the approximation. This assessment is often done based on the Frobenius norm (F-norm). In this work, we argue that the F-norm, as the ``point-to-point'' distance, may not always be appropriate. Viewing from the perspective of cone, NMF may not naturally align with F-norm. So, a ray-to-ray chordal distance is proposed as an alternative way of measuring the quality of the approximation. As this measure corresponds to the Euclidean distance on the sphere, it motivates the use of manifold optimization techniques. We apply Riemannian optimization technique to solve chordal-NMF by casting it on a manifold. Unlike works on Riemannian optimization that require the manifold to be smooth, the nonnegativity in chordal-NMF defines a non-differentiable manifold. We propose a Riemannian Multiplicative Update (RMU), and showcase the effectiveness of the chordal-NMF on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Parallel Simulation for Log-concave Sampling and Score-based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is fundamental in machine learning and statistics. As datasets grow larger, computational efficiency becomes increasingly important, particularly in reducing adaptive complexity, namely the number of sequential rounds required for sampling algorithms. While recent works have introduced several parallelizable techniques, they often exhibit suboptimal convergence rates and remain significantly weaker than the latest lower bounds for log-concave sampling. To address this, we propose a novel parallel sampling method that improves adaptive complexity dependence on dimension $d$ reducing it from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log d)$. which is even optimal for log-concave sampling with some specific adaptive complexity. Our approach builds on parallel simulation techniques from scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing accuracy on clean data. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.</description>

      <title>AI Assistants to Enhance and Exploit the PETSc Knowledge Base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>RAPTOR: Practical Numerical Profiling of Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of low-precision units in modern high-performance architectures increasingly burdens domain scientists. Historically, the choice in HPC was easy: can we get away with 32 bit floating-point operations and lower bandwidth requirements, or is FP64 necessary? Driven by Artificial Intelligence, vendors introduce novel low-precision units for vector and tensor operations, and FP64 capabilities stagnate or are reduced. This forces scientists to re-evaluate their codes, but a trivial search-and-replace approach to go from FP64 to FP16 will not suffice.
  We introduce RAPTOR: a numerical profiling tool to guide scientists in their search for code regions where precision lowering is feasible. Using LLVM, we transparently replace high-precision computations using low-precision units, or emulate a user-defined precision. RAPTOR is a novel, feature-rich approach -- with focus on ease of use -- to change, profile, and reason about numerical requirements and instabilities, which we demonstrate with four real-world multi-physics Flash-X applications.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with just-in-time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Matrix Separation Problem: Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When given a generalized matrix separation problem, which aims to recover a low rank matrix $L_0$ and a sparse matrix $S_0$ from $M_0=L_0+HS_0$, the work \cite{CW25} proposes a novel convex optimization problem whose objective function is the sum of the $\ell_1$-norm and nuclear norm. In this paper we detail the iterative algorithms and its associated computations for solving this convex optimization problem. We present various efficient implementation strategies, with attention to practical cases where $H$ is circulant, separable, or block structured. Notably, we propose a preconditioning technique that drastically improved the performance of our algorithms in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. While this paper serves as an illustrative algorithm implementation manual, we also provide theoretical guarantee for our preconditioning strategy. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</description>
