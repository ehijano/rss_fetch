      <title>Einstein Constants and Smooth Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was first shown in (Catanese-LeBrun 1997) that certain high-dimensional smooth closed manifolds admit pairs of Einstein metrics with Ricci curvatures of opposite sign. After reviewing subsequent progress that has been made on this topic, we then prove various related results, with the ultimate goal of stimulating further research on associated questions.</description>

      <title>Regularized $n$-Conformal heat flow and global smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the regularized conformal heat flow of $n$-harmonic maps, or simply regularized $n$-conformal heat flow from $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. This is a system of evolution equations combined with regularized $n$-harmonic map flow and a metric evolution equation in conformal direction. For $n=2$, the conformal heat flow does not develop finite time singularity unlike usual harmonic map flow \cite{P23} (Park, 2024). In this paper, we show the analogous result, that regularized $n$-conformal heat flow does not develop finite time singularity unlike the (regularized) $n$-harmonic map flow.</description>

      <title>Flat Convergence of Pushforwards of Rectifiable Currents Under $C^0-$Diffeomorphism Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of differential forms and currents on compact Riemannian manifolds when subjected to $C^0$-limits of diffeomorphisms. Employing techniques from geometric analysis, measure theory, and homotopy theory, we establish several key convergence results. We show that pullbacks of differential forms converge uniformly (in $C^0$ norm), and pushforwards of currents exhibit weak$-\ast$ convergence. We prove that pushforwards of rectifiable currents converge in the flat norm, a result particularly relevant for the study of singular geometric objects. Furthermore, through a detailed analysis of conformal transformations, we revisit the invariance of pole singularities of arbitrary order under pushforward by diffeomorphisms. These stability results offer tools for analyzing geometric structures, including applications to the stability of groups of symplectomorphisms, cosymplectomorphisms, and contact transformations under $C^0$ perturbations. We also highlight the applicability of our findings in areas such as measure theory, and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring information geometry: Recent Advances and Connections to Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This introductory text arises from a lecture given in G\"oteborg, Sweden, given by the first author and is intended for undergraduate students, as well as for any mathematically inclined reader wishing to explore a synthesis of ideas connecting geometry and statistics. At its core, this work seeks to illustrate the profound and yet natural interplay between differential geometry, probability theory, and the rich algebraic structures encoded in (pre-)Frobenius manifolds.
  The exposition is structured into three principal parts. The first part provides a concise introduction to differential topology and geometry, emphasizing the role of smooth manifolds, connections, and curvature in the formulation of geometric structures. The second part is devoted to probability, measures, and statistics, where the notion of a probability space is refined into a geometric object, thus paving the way for a deeper mathematical understanding of statistical models. Finally, in the third part, we introduce (pre-)Frobenius manifolds, revealing their surprising connection to exponential families of probability distributions and, discuss more broadly, their role in the geometry of information. At the end of those three parts the reader will find stimulating exercises.
  By bringing together these seemingly distant disciplines, we aim to highlight the natural emergence of geometric structures in statistical theory. This work does not seek to be exhaustive but rather to provide the reader with a pathway into a domain of mathematics that is still in its formative stages, where many fundamental questions remain open. The text is accessible without requiring advanced prerequisites and should serve as an invitation to further exploration.</description>

      <title>Hyperelliptic curves, minitwistors, and spacelike Zoll spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a compact minitwistor space from a hyperelliptic curve with real structure and show that it yields a lot of new Lorentzian Einstein-Weyl spaces all of which are diffeomorphic to the 3-dimensional deSitter space. These structures are real analytic, admit a circle symmetry and moreover, all their spacelike geodesics are closed and simple. The number of the nodes of minitwistor lines on the minitwistor space is equal to the genus of the hyperelliptic curve and is taken arbitrarily. These Einstein-Weyl structures deform as the hyperelliptic curves deform, and so have $(2g-1)$-dimensional moduli space, where $g$ is the genus of the hyperelliptic curve. A relationship between the minitwistor spaces recently obtained by Hitchin from ALE gravitational instantons is also given for A$_{\rm odd}$-type.</description>

      <title>Instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces from initial data set symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\tilde{\Sigma},h_{ab},K_{ab})$ be an initial data set and let $x^a$ be a symmetry vector of $\tilde{\Sigma}$. Consider a MOTS $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$ and let the symmetry vector be decomposable along the unit normal to $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$, and along $\mathcal{S}$. In this note we present some basic results with regards to the stability of $\mathcal{S}$. The vector decomposition allows us to characterize the instability of $\mathcal{S}$ by the nature of the zero set of the normal component to $\mathcal{S}$ and the divergence of the component along $\mathcal{S}$. Further observations are made under the assumption of $\mathcal{S}$ having a constant mean curvature, and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ being an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Open orbits in causal flag manifolds, modular flows and wedge regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study open orbits of symmetric subgroups of a simple connected
  Lie group G on a causal flag manifold.
  First we show that a flag manifold M of G carries an invariant causal structure if and only if G is hermitian
  of tube type and M is the conformal completion
  of the corresponding simple euclidean Jordan algebra,
  resp., the Shilov boundary of the associated symmetric tube domain.
  We then study open orbits in M under symmetric subgroups,
  also called causal
  Makarevic spaces, from the perspective of applications in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT). A key motivation is the geometry of corresponding modular flows.
  The open orbits are reductive causal symmetric
  spaces, which arise in two flavors:
  compactly causal and non-compactly causal ones.
  In the non-compactly causal case we determine the corresponding Euler elements
  and their positivity regions. For compactly causal spaces,
  modular flows do not always exist and we determine
  when this is the case. Then the positivity regions of the modular flows are not globally hyperbolic,
  but these spaces contain other interesting
  globally hyperbolic subsets that can be described
  in terms of the conformally flat Jordan coordinates via Cayley charts.
  We discuss the Lorentzian case, involving de Sitter
  and anti-de Sitter space in some detail.</description>

      <title>The structure of weakly stable CMC hypersurfaces with free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a two-sided complete noncompact weakly stable immersion of free boundary CMC $H$-hypersurface $(M^{n},\partial M)\hookrightarrow(N^{n+1},\partial N)$ must have one end, if $N$ has weakly convex boundary, satisfies $\inf\Ric_{N}&gt;-\frac{1}{n}H^2$ and $\biRic_{N}\geq \frac{(n-5)}{4}H^2$, and $M$ has infinite volume. In addition, we also establish a non-existence result of free boundary CMC hypersurface under certain condition, which is elaborated in theorem 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bonnet has characterized his surfaces by a geometric condition. What is done here is a characterization of the same surfaces by two analytic conditions: (i) the mean curvature $H$ of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ should admit a reduction to an ordinary differential equation; (ii) this latter equation should possess the Painlev\'e property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction method for triharmonic maps to spheres. In particular, we show that for any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m\geq 3$ there exists a triharmonic map from $\mathbb{R}^m\setminus\{0\}$ into a round sphere. In addition, we provide a construction method for proper $r$-harmonic maps between spheres based on a suitable deformation of eigenmaps.</description>

      <title>Positive Biorthogonal Curvature on $S^2 \times T^2$: An open problem no more?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11914v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the long-standing open problem regarding the existence of a Riemannian metric on $ S^2 \times T^2 $ with strictly positive biorthogonal curvature: "Does $S^2 \times T^2$ admit a Riemannian metric with positive biorthogonal curvature?". Biorthogonal curvature, defined as the average of the sectional curvatures of a plane and its orthogonal complement, represents an intermediate condition between positive sectional curvature and positive scalar curvature. By rigorously analyzing topological and geometric constraints, we show the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find information geometry of tempered stable processes. Starting with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, Fisher information matrices of tempered stable processes and $\alpha$-connections of their statistical manifolds are obtained. Additionally, we also provide statistical applications for the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly decreasing tempered stable processes are given as examples.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical trace formula for the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semiclassical Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac{1}{p^2}\Delta^{L^p\otimes E}+V$ on tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ twisted by a Hermitian vector bundle $E$ on a Riemannian manifold of bounded geometry. For any function $\varphi\in C^\infty_c(\mathbb R)$, we consider the bounded linear operator $\varphi(H_p)$ in $L^2(X,L^p\otimes E)$ defined by the spectral theorem. We prove that its smooth Schwartz kernel on the diagonal admits a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of $p^{-1}$ in the semiclassical limit $p\to \infty$. In particular, when the manifold is compact, we get a complete asymptotic expansion for the trace of $\varphi(H_p)$.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove a convergence theorem in the context of $3+1$ dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M}$ of topological type $M\times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed connected oriented Riemannian $3-$manifold of negative Yamabe type. The theorem concerns the global existence of the solutions of the vacuum Einstein$-\Lambda$ equations for arbitrary large initial data and convergence of the spatial geometry to a constant negative scalar curvature metric in a constant mean extrinsic curvature (CMC) transported spatial gauge. This theorem could be interpreted as a weak cosmic censorship result in the cosmological framework under \textit{generic} initial data. An important corollary of the theorem is the failure of cosmological principle as a derived consequence of Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant as well as the failure of geometrization of spatial slice in the sense of Thurston. A similar theorem is stated for positive Yamabe slices under a technical assumption.</description>

Abstract: We show that the conservation law of the overdetermined system $u_t - 4u_x^3 - u_{xxx} = 0$, $u_y = 0$, associated with the characteristic $(u_{xy}, 0)$, is non-trivial despite the characteristic vanishing on the system.</description>

      <title>Curves on Compact Arithmetic Quotients of Hyperbolic 2-ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the simplest type of compact arithmetic quotients of the hyperbolic 2-ball $\mathbb{B}^2$, which has a moduli interpretation for certain types of abelian varieties of dimension 6 with $\mathcal{O}_F$-endomorphism, where $F$ is a CM extension of a real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$. Under mild assumption, we prove that for any fixed $g$, when the defining discriminant $D$ is large, there will be no complex curves of genus $g$ on this type of arithmetic quotients. The proof uses the technique of volume estimates, which requires us to understand the distribution of special subvarieties and the geometry near quotient and cusp singularities.</description>

      <title>Disc stackings and their Morse index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct free boundary minimal disc stackings, with any number of strata, in the three-dimensional Euclidean unit ball, and prove uniform, linear lower and upper bounds on the Morse index of all such surfaces. Among other things, our work implies for any positive integer $k$ the existence of $k$-tuples of distinct, pairwise non-congruent, embedded free boundary minimal surfaces all having the same topological type. In addition, since we prove that the equivariant Morse index of any such free boundary minimal stacking, with respect to its maximal symmetry group, is bounded from below by (the integer part of) half the number of layers, it follows that any possible realization of such surfaces via an equivariant min-max method would need to employ sweepouts with an arbitrarily large number of parameters. This also shows that it is only for $N=2$ and $N=3$ layers that free boundary minimal disc stackings can be obtained by means of one-dimensional mountain pass schemes.</description>

      <title>The classification of complete improper affine spheres with singularities of low total curvature and new examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a classification of complete improper affine spheres with singularities (say \emph{improper affine fronts}) in unimodular affine three-space $\boldsymbol{R}^3$ whose total curvature is greater than or equal to $-6\pi$, and a partial classification in the case of total curvature $-8\pi$. For the case of total curvature $-8\pi$, we give a complete classification for genus $0$ case and show the existence of an example and a one parameter family with genus $1$. We also study the asymptotic behavior of embedded ends of complete improper affine fronts. Moreover, we give new examples for this class of surfaces, including one which satisfies the equality condition of an Osserman-type inequality and is of positive genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through exploring the embedded transnormal systems of codimension 1, we show the existence of a transnormal function on a connected complete Riemannian manifold requires the underlying manifold to have a vector bundle structure or a linear double disk bundle decomposition. Conversely, any smooth manifold with either of these structures can be endowed with a Riemannian metric so that it admits a transnormal function, which, under suitable compactness conditions, can become isoparametric. As a corollary, for compact manifolds, the existences of transnormal and isoparametric functions impose the same topological constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isotropic harmonic oscillator and the Kepler-Coulomb system are two examples of second-order (maximally) superintegrable (Hamiltonian) systems, and they are pivotal models in the Sciences. They are classified in dimension two and, partially, in dimension three.
  We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for second-order superintegrable systems with a $(n+1)$-parameter potential to extend to so-called non-degenerate systems, i.e.\ systems with a larger family of compatible potentials. Concretely, we show that a $(n+1)$-parameter potential is the restriction of a non-degenerate potential if and only if a certain trace-free tensor field vanishes.</description>

      <title>A normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary towards the complete hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\overline{M},g_0)$ be a $2$-D compact surface with boundary $\partial M$ and its interior $M$. We show that for a large class of initial and boundary data, the initial-boundary value problem of the normalized Ricci flow $(1.10)-(1.12)$, with prescribed geodesic curvature $\psi$ on $\partial M$, has a unique solution for all $t&gt;0$, and it converges to the complete hyperbolic metric locally uniformly in $M$. Here the natural condition that $\psi&gt;0$ causes the main difficulty in the a priori estimates in the corresponding initial-boundary problem $(1.15)-(1.17)$ of the parabolic equations, for which an auxiliary Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is introduced. We also provide examples of the boundary data $\psi$ which fits well with the natural asymptotic behavior of the geodesic curvature, but the solution to $(1.10)-(1.12)$ fails to converge to the complete hyperbolic metric.</description>

Abstract: We develop theory and methods that use the graph Laplacian to analyze the geometry of the underlying manifold of datasets. Our theory provides theoretical guarantees and explicit bounds on the functional forms of the graph Laplacian when it acts on functions defined close to singularities of the underlying manifold. We use these explicit bounds to develop tests for singularities and propose methods that can be used to estimate geometric properties of singularities in the datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13058v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Cheeger inequality, a lower bound on the first nontrivial eigenvalue of a Laplacian, to the case of geometric sub-Laplacians on rank-varying Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces and we describe a concrete method to lower bound the Cheeger constant. The proof is geometric, and works for Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. One of the main technical tools in the proof is a generalization of Courant's nodal domain theorem, which is proven from scratch for Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. Carnot groups and the Baouendi-Grushin cylinder are treated as examples.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver bundles with applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be Artin and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we recover Nakajima quiver varieties and provide an alternate construction for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are moduli stacks that are Artin, parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver varieties, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the results of ($\textit{Groups, Geom. Dyn.}$, forthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on higher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\mathbf{N}\rtimes \mathbb{R}^k$. We show that the rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific restriction of the metric to $\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough similarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space $SL_k(\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe a family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new technique of $\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.</description>
