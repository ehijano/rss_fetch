      <title>Maturity of Vehicle Digital Twins: From Monitoring to Enabling Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twinning of vehicles is an iconic application of digital twins, as the concept of twinning dates back to the twinning of NASA space vehicles. Although digital twins (DTs) in the automotive industry have been recognized for their ability to improve efficiency in design and manufacturing, their potential to enhance land vehicle operation has yet to be fully explored. Most existing DT research on vehicle operations, aside from the existing body of work on autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), focuses on electrified passenger cars. However, the use and value of twinning varies depending on the goal, whether it is to provide cost-efficient and sustainable freight transport without disruptions, sustainable public transport focused on passenger well-being, or fully autonomous vehicle operation. In this context, DTs are used for a range of applications, from real-time battery health monitoring to enabling fully autonomous vehicle operations. This leads to varying requirements, complexities, and maturities of the implemented DT solutions. This paper analyzes recent trends in DT-driven efficiency gains for freight, public, and autonomous vehicles and discusses their required level of maturity based on a maturity tool. The application of our DT maturity tool reveals that most DTs have reached level 3 and enable real-time monitoring. Additionally, DTs of level 5 already exist in closed environments, allowing for restricted autonomous operation.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Myographic Motion: Repurposing the Myo Armband to Control Disposable Pneumatic Sculptures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper details the development of an interactive sculpture built from deprecated hardware technology and intentionally decomposable, transient materials. We detail a case study of "Strain" - an emotive prototype that reclaims two orphaned digital artifacts to power a kinetic sculpture made of common disposable objects. We use the Myo, an abandoned myoelectric armband, in concert with the Programmable Air, a soft-robotics prototyping project, to manipulate a pneumatic bladder array constructed from condoms, bamboo skewers, and a small library of 3D printed PLA plastic connectors designed to work with these generic parts. The resulting sculpture achieves surprisingly organic actuation. The goal of this project is to produce several reusable components: software to resuscitate the Myo Armband, homeostasis software for the Programmable Air or equivalent pneumatic projects, and a library of easily-printed parts that will work with generic bamboo disposables for sculptural prototyping. This project works to develop usable, repeatable engineering by applying it to a slightly whimsical object that promotes a strong emotional response in its audience. Through this, we transform the disposable into the sustainable. In this paper, we reflect on project-based insights into rescuing and revitalizing abandoned consumer electronics for future works.</description>

      <title>The Clarkston AR Gateways Project: Anchoring Refugee Presence and Narratives in a Small Town</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines the Clarkston AR Gateways Project, a speculative process and artifact entering its second phase, where Augmented Reality (AR) will be used to amplify the diverse narratives of Clarkston, Georgia's refugee community. Focused on anchoring their stories and presence into the town's physical and digital landscapes, the project employs a participatory co-design approach, engaging directly with community members. This placemaking effort aims to uplift refugees by teaching them AR development skills that help them more autonomously express and elevate their voices through public art. The result is hoped to be AR experiences that not only challenge prevailing narratives but also celebrate the tapestry of cultures in the small town. This work is supported through AR's unique affordance for users to situate their experiences as interactive narratives within public spaces. Such site-specific AR interactive stories can encourage interactions within those spaces that shift how they are conceived, perceived, and experienced. This process of refugee-driven AR creation reflexively alters the space and affirms their presence and agency. The project's second phase aims to establish a model adaptable to diverse, refugee-inclusive communities, demonstrating how AR storytelling can be a powerful tool for cultural orientation and celebration.</description>
