      <title>ExoFabric: A Re-moldable Textile System for Creating Customizable Soft Goods and Wearable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabric has been a fundamental part of human life for thousands of years, providing comfort, protection, and aesthetic expression. While modern advancements have enhanced fabric's functionality, it remains static and unchangeable, failing to adapt to our evolving body shapes and preferences. This lack of adaptability can lead to unsustainable practices, as consumers often buy more items to meet their changing needs. In this paper, we propose ExoFabric, a re-moldable fabric system for customized soft goods applications. We created ExoFabric by embedding thermoplastic threads into fabric through computerized embroidery to allow for tunability between rigid plastic and conformable fabric. We defined a library of design primitives to enable geometric formability, stiffness, and stretchability by identifying suitable fabrics, threads, embroidery parameters, and machine limitations. To facilitate practical applications, we demonstrated practical methods for linking parameters to application requirements, showcasing form-fitting wearables, structural support, and shape-changeable furniture for repeatable or one-time customization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromobility vehicles, such as e-scooters, are increasingly popular in urban communities but present significant challenges in terms of road safety, user privacy, infrastructure planning, and civil engineering. Addressing these critical issues requires a large-scale and easily accessible research infrastructure to collect diverse mobility and contextual data from micromobility users in realistic settings. To this end, we present ScooterLab, a community research testbed comprising a fleet of customizable battery-powered micromobility vehicles retrofitted with advanced sensing, communication, and control capabilities. ScooterLab enables interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computing, mobility, and urban planning by providing researchers with tools to design and deploy customized sensing experiments and access curated datasets. The testbed will enable advances in machine learning, privacy, and urban transportation research while promoting sustainable mobility.</description>

      <title>Towards Probabilistic Inference of Human Motor Intentions by Assistive Mobile Robots Controlled via a Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</description>

      <title>Learning to Measure Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has attracted growing attention, prompting extensive research into quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to solve diverse and complex problems. Designing high-performance QML models demands expert-level proficiency, which remains a significant obstacle to the broader adoption of QML. A few major hurdles include crafting effective data encoding techniques and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are crucial to the performance of QML models. Additionally, the measurement phase is frequently overlooked-most current QML models rely on pre-defined measurement protocols that often fail to account for the specific problem being addressed. We introduce a novel approach that makes the observable of the quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-learnable. Our method features an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, where the parameterized observable is trained alongside the ordinary quantum circuit parameters simultaneously. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method can identify observables for variational quantum circuits that lead to improved outcomes, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby boosting the overall performance of QML models.</description>

      <title>Resistive memory-based zero-shot liquid state machine for multimodal event data learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex spiking neural network (SNN), capable of learning multimodal signals in a zero-shot manner by generalizing existing knowledge. Remarkably, it maintains minimal power consumption through event-based signal propagation. However, replicating the human brain in neuromorphic hardware presents both hardware and software challenges. Hardware limitations, such as the slowdown of Moore's law and Von Neumann bottleneck, hinder the efficiency of digital computers. Additionally, SNNs are characterized by their software training complexities. To this end, we propose a hardware-software co-design on a 40 nm 256 Kb in-memory computing macro that physically integrates a fixed and random liquid state machine (LSM) SNN encoder with trainable artificial neural network (ANN) projections. We showcase the zero-shot LSM-based learning of multimodal events on the N-MNIST and N-TIDIGITS datasets, including visual and audio data association, as well as neural and visual data alignment for brain-machine interfaces. Our co-design achieves classification accuracy comparable to fully optimized software models, resulting in a 152.83 and 393.07-fold reduction in training costs compared to SOTA contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and Prototypical networks, and a 23.34 and 160-fold improvement in energy efficiency compared to cutting-edge digital hardware, respectively. These proof-of-principle prototypes demonstrate zero-shot multimodal events learning capability for emerging efficient and compact neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>On Large Language Models in Mission-Critical IT Governance: Are We Ready Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a pressing concern since the advent of computers and has become even more critical in today's era of cyber warfare. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), essential for national security, requires swift and robust governance, yet recent events reveal the increasing difficulty of meeting these challenges. Aim. Building on prior research showcasing the potential of Generative AI (GAI), such as Large Language Models, in enhancing risk analysis, we aim to explore practitioners' views on integrating GAI into the governance of IT MCSs. Our goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Problem Solving in Mixed Reality: A Study on Visual Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem solving is a composite cognitive process, invoking a number of systems and subsystems, such as perception and memory. Individuals may form collectives to solve a given problem together, in collaboration, especially when complexity is thought to be high. To determine if and when collaborative problem solving is desired, we must quantify collaboration first. For this, we investigate the practical virtue of collaborative problem solving. Using visual graph analysis, we perform a study with 72 participants in two countries and three languages. We compare ad hoc pairs to individuals and nominal pairs, solving two different tasks on graphs in visuospatial mixed reality. The average collaborating pair does not outdo its nominal counterpart, but it does have a significant trade-off against the individual: an ad hoc pair uses 1.46 more time to achieve 4.6 higher accuracy. We also use the concept of task instance complexity to quantify differences in complexity. As task instance complexity increases, these differences largely scale, though with two notable exceptions. With this study we show the importance of using nominal groups as benchmark in collaborative virtual environments research. We conclude that a mixed reality environment does not automatically imply superior collaboration.</description>
