      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic collocation schemes for Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyse numerical schemes for uncertainty quantification in neural field equations subject to random parametric data in the synaptic kernel, firing rate, external stimulus, and initial conditions. The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</description>

      <title>The Fractal Blueprint: Soil Pores, Symmetry, and Climate Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soil is a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, directly influencing global biogeochemical cycles. Despite its importance, the complex architecture of soil pores and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions remain poorly understood. This perspective aims to address this gap by applying discrete symmetry and symmetry-breaking concepts through fractal geometry to elucidate the structural and functional complexities of soil pores. We highlight how fractal parameters can quantify the self-similar nature of soil pore structures, revealing their size, shape, and connectivity. These geometric attributes influence soil properties such as permeability and diffusivity, which are essential for understanding gas exchange and microbial activity within the soil matrix. Furthermore, we emphasize the effects of various land management practices, including tillage and wetting-drying cycles, on soil pore complexity using three-dimensional multi-fractal analysis. Literature indicates that different agricultural practices significantly alter pore heterogeneity and connectivity, affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional tillage decreases pore connectivity and increases randomness, whereas no-tillage preserves larger, more complex pore structures. We propose that integrating combinatorial, geometric, and functional symmetry concepts offers a comprehensive framework for examining the structure-property-function relationships in soil. This novel approach could enhance our understanding of soil's role in the global cycle of greenhouse gases and provide insights into sustainable land management practices aimed at mitigating climate change.</description>
