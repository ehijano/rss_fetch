      <title>How to Strategize Human Content Creation in the Era of GenAI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) will have significant impact on content creation platforms. In this paper, we study the dynamic competition between a GenAI and a human contributor. Unlike the human, the GenAI's content only improves when more contents are created by human over the time; however, GenAI has the advantage of generating content at a lower cost. We study the algorithmic problem in this dynamic competition model about how the human contributor can maximize her utility when competing against the GenAI for content generation over a set of topics. In time-sensitive content domains (e.g., news or pop music creation) where contents' value diminishes over time, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the human's optimal (dynamic) strategy, unless the randomized exponential time hypothesis is false. Fortunately, we are able to design a polynomial time algorithm that naturally cycles between myopically optimizing over a short time window and pausing and provably guarantees an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$. We then turn to time-insensitive content domains where contents do not lose their value (e.g., contents on history facts). Interestingly, we show that this setting permits a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the human's utility in the long run.</description>

      <title>Games on Graphs: A Time-Efficient Algorithm for Solving Finite Reachability and Safety Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in games on graphs within the research community, fueled by their relevance in applications such as economics, politics, and epidemiology. This paper aims to comprehensively detail the design decisions involved in developing a time-efficient algorithm for solving finite reachability and safety games on graphs. The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel algorithm that effectively addresses both reachability and safety games by exploiting their inherent duality. The performance of the proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated against traditional methods using a randomized testing framework. The paper is organized as follows: first, we provide the reader with a theoretical overview of reachability and safety games, followed by an in-depth discussion on the construction of the playing arena. A formal definition of reachability and safety games and a review of traditional algorithms for their resolution are then presented. Subsequently, the multiple-perspective algorithm is introduced along with its optimizations. The paper concludes with an extensive set of experiments and a comprehensive discussion of their results.</description>

      <title>A Little Aggression Goes a Long Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggression is a two-player game of troop placement and attack played on a map (modeled as a graph). Players take turns deploying troops on a territory (a vertex on the graph) until they run out. Once all troops are placed, players take turns attacking enemy territories. A territory can be attacked if it has $k$ troops and there are more than $k$ enemy troops on adjacent territories. At the end of the game, the player who controls the most territories wins. In the case of a tie, the player with more surviving troops wins. The first player to exhaust their troops in the placement phase leads the attack phase.
  We study the complexity of the game when the graph along with an assignment of troops and the sequence of attacks planned by the second player. Even in this restrained setting, we show that the problem of determining an optimal sequence of first player moves is NP-complete. We then analyze the game for when the input graph is a matching or a cycle.</description>

      <title>Sponsored Search Auction Design Beyond Single Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auction design for the modern advertising market has gained significant prominence in the field of game theory. With the recent rise of auto-bidding tools, an increasing number of advertisers in the market are utilizing these tools for auctions. The diverse array of auto-bidding tools has made auction design more challenging. Various types of bidders, such as quasi-linear utility maximizers and constrained value maximizers, coexist within this dynamic gaming environment. We study sponsored search auction design in such a mixed-bidder world and aim to design truthful mechanisms that maximize the total social welfare. To simultaneously capture the classical utility and the value-max utility, we introduce an allowance utility model. In this model, each bidder is endowed with an additional allowance parameter, signifying the threshold up to which the bidder can maintain a value-max strategy. The paper distinguishes two settings based on the accessibility of the allowance information. In the case where each bidder's allowance is public, we demonstrate the existence of a truthful mechanism achieving an approximation ratio of $(1+\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. In the more challenging private allowance setting, we establish that a truthful mechanism can achieve a constant approximation. Further, we consider uniform-price auction design in large markets and give a truthful mechanism that sets a uniform price in a random manner and admits bounded approximation in expectation.</description>

      <title>Risk Sensitivity in Markov Games and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov games (MGs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are studied to model decision making in multi-agent systems. Traditionally, the objective in MG and MARL has been risk-neutral, i.e., agents are assumed to optimize a performance metric such as expected return, without taking into account subjective or cognitive preferences of themselves or of other agents. However, ignoring such preferences leads to inaccurate models of decision making in many real-world scenarios in finance, operations research, and behavioral economics. Therefore, when these preferences are present, it is necessary to incorporate a suitable measure of risk into the optimization objective of agents, which opens the door to risk-sensitive MG and MARL. In this paper, we systemically review the literature on risk sensitivity in MG and MARL that has been growing in recent years alongside other areas of reinforcement learning and game theory. We define and mathematically describe different risk measures used in MG and MARL and individually for each measure, discuss articles that incorporate it. Finally, we identify recent trends in theoretical and applied works in the field and discuss possible directions of future research.</description>

      <title>Automating Food Drop: The Power of Two Choices for Dynamic and Fair Food Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food waste and food insecurity are two closely related pressing global issues. Food rescue organizations worldwide run programs aimed at addressing the two problems. In this paper, we partner with a non-profit organization in the state of Indiana that leads \emph{Food Drop}, a program that is designed to redirect rejected truckloads of food away from landfills and into food banks. The truckload to food bank matching decisions are currently made by an employee of our partner organization. In addition to this being a very time-consuming task, as perhaps expected from human-based matching decisions, the allocations are often skewed: a small percentage of the possible recipients receives the majority of donations. Our goal in this partnership is to completely automate Food Drop. In doing so, we need a matching algorithm for making real-time decisions that strikes a balance between ensuring fairness for the food banks that receive the food and optimizing efficiency for the truck drivers. In this paper, we describe the theoretical guarantees and experiments that dictated our choice of algorithm in the platform we built and deployed for our partner organization. Our work also makes contributions to the literature on load balancing and balls-into-bins games, that might be of independent interest. Specifically, we study the allocation of $m$ weighted balls into $n$ weighted bins, where each ball has two non-uniformly sampled random bin choices, and prove upper bounds, that hold with high probability, on the maximum load of any bin.</description>

      <title>Group-wise oracle-efficient algorithms for online multi-group learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-group learning, a learning model in which an online learner must simultaneously achieve small prediction regret on a large collection of (possibly overlapping) subsequences corresponding to a family of groups. Groups are subsets of the context space, and in fairness applications, they may correspond to subpopulations defined by expressive functions of demographic attributes. In contrast to previous work on this learning model, we consider scenarios in which the family of groups is too large to explicitly enumerate, and hence we seek algorithms that only access groups via an optimization oracle. In this paper, we design such oracle-efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under a variety of settings, including: (i) the i.i.d. setting, (ii) the adversarial setting with smoothed context distributions, and (iii) the adversarial transductive setting.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Interval-Regulated Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study third-degree price discrimination in a model first presented in Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015]. Since such price discrimination might create market segments with vastly different posted prices, we consider regulating these prices, specifically, via restricting them to lie within an interval. Given a price interval, we consider segmentations of the market where a seller, who is oblivious to the existence of such regulation, still posts prices within the price interval. We show the following surprising result: For any market and price interval where such segmentation is feasible, there is always a different segmentation that optimally transfers all excess surplus to the consumers. In addition, we characterize the entire space of buyer and seller surplus that are achievable by such segmentation, including maximizing seller surplus, and simultaneously minimizing buyer and seller surplus.</description>

      <title>Randomized Binary and Tree Search under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized binary search problem on the line and general trees. On the line (e.g., a sorted array), binary search finds a target node in $O(\log n)$ queries in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In situations with limited budget or time, we might only be able to perform a few queries, possibly sub-logarithmic many. In this case, it is impossible to guarantee that the target will be found regardless of its position. Our main result is the construction of a randomized strategy that maximizes the minimum (over the target position) probability of finding the target. Such a strategy provides a natural solution where there is no apriori (stochastic) information of the target's position. As with regular binary search, we can find and run the strategy in $O(\log n)$ time (and using only $O(\log n)$ random bits). Our construction is obtained by reinterpreting the problem as a two-player (\textit{seeker} and \textit{hider}) zero-sum game and exploiting an underlying number theoretical structure.
  Furthermore, we generalize the setting to study a search game on trees. In this case, a query returns the edge's endpoint closest to the target. Again, when the number of queries is bounded by some given $k$, we quantify a \emph{the-less-queries-the-better} approach by defining a seeker's profit $p$ depending on the number of queries needed to locate the hider. For the linear programming formulation of the corresponding zero-sum game, we show that computing the best response for the hider (i.e., the separation problem of the underlying dual LP) can be done in time $O(n^2 2^{2k})$, where $n$ is the size of the tree. This result allows to compute a Nash equilibrium in polynomial time whenever $k=O(\log n)$. In contrast, computing the best response for the hider is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Rank-Collections: Analyzing Expected Strategic Behavior with Uncertain Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game theory relies heavily on the availability of cardinal utility functions, but in fields such as matching markets, only ordinal preferences are typically elicited. The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant strategies, but many real-world applications lack dominant strategies, making the intensity of preferences between outcomes important for determining strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal utilities is not available, some data about the likelihood of utility functions is often accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize uncertainty about the decision-makers' utilities by viewing them as a collection of normal-form games where uncertainty about types persists throughout all game stages. Instead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we study how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play. To do this, we introduce a novel solution concept called $\alpha$-Rank-collections, which extends $\alpha$-Rank to Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze strategic play in, for example, non-strategyproof matching markets, for which appropriate solution concepts are currently lacking. $\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize the expected probability of encountering a certain strategy profile under replicator dynamics in the long run, rather than predicting a specific equilibrium strategy profile. We experimentally evaluate $\alpha$-Rank-collections using instances of the Boston mechanism, finding that our solution concept provides more nuanced predictions compared to Bayes-Nash equilibria. Additionally, we prove that $\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to positive affine transformations, a standard property for a solution concept, and are efficient to approximate.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Perturbed Mirror Descent for Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a payoff perturbation technique for the Mirror Descent (MD) algorithm in games where the gradient of the payoff functions is monotone in the strategy profile space, potentially containing additive noise. The optimistic family of learning algorithms, exemplified by optimistic MD, successfully achieves {\it last-iterate} convergence in scenarios devoid of noise, leading the dynamics to a Nash equilibrium. A recent re-emerging trend underscores the promise of the perturbation approach, where payoff functions are perturbed based on the distance from an anchoring, or {\it slingshot}, strategy. In response, we propose {\it Adaptively Perturbed MD} (APMD), which adjusts the magnitude of the perturbation by repeatedly updating the slingshot strategy at a predefined interval. This innovation empowers us to find a Nash equilibrium of the underlying game with guaranteed rates. Empirical demonstrations affirm that our algorithm exhibits significantly accelerated convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new high-performance activation function, Moderate Adaptive Linear Units (MoLU), for the deep neural network. The MoLU is a simple, beautiful and powerful activation function that can be a good main activation function among hundreds of activation functions. Because the MoLU is made up of the elementary functions, not only it is a infinite diffeomorphism (i.e. smooth and infinitely differentiable over whole domains), but also it decreases training time.</description>
