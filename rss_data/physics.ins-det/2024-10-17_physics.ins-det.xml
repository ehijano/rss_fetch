      <title>Segmented readout for Cherenkov time-of-flight positron emission tomography detectors based on bismuth germanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive biomedical imaging modality for non-invasively detecting and visualizing positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals within a subject. In PET, measuring the time-of-flight (TOF) information for each pair of 511-keV annihilation photons improves effective sensitivity but requires high timing resolution. Hybrid materials that emit both scintillation and Cherenkov photons, such as bismuth germanate (BGO), recently offer the potential for more precise timing information from Cherenkov photons while maintaining adequate energy resolution from scintillation photons. However, a significant challenge in using such hybrid materials for TOF PET applications lies in the event-dependent timing spread caused by the mixed detection of Cherenkov and scintillation photons due to relatively lower production of Cherenkov photons. This study introduces an innovative approach by segmenting silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels coupled to a single crystal, rather than using traditional SiPMs that are as large as or larger than the crystals they read. We demonstrated that multiple time stamps and photon counts obtained from the segmented SiPM can classify events by providing temporal photon density, effectively addressing this challenge. The approach and findings would lead to new opportunities in applications that require precise timing and photon counting, spanning the fields of medical imaging, high-energy physics, and optical physics.</description>

      <title>Surface plasmon resonance sensor based on a novel prism for the detection of a broad range of polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplastics are pervasive pollutants that pose threats to the environment and human health. Detecting them reliably represents a crucial step toward finding solutions. While traditional techniques like vibrational and mass spectroscopies are time-consuming and have limitations in analysing polymers with pigment additives, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) shows promise due to its high sensitivity and rapid detection capabilities.However, existing SPR methods rely on one output variable and fail to determine various microplastic parameters simultaneously. To address this uncertainty between size and polymer type, we propose a prism design that enables SPR resonance in a refractive index range of 1.402-1.56 RIU (Refractive Index Units) for polymer detection. Experimental verification of the prism's dynamic range using refractive index oils presented an agreement of 98.47% with theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we acquired SPR curves from ten different polymer types, including Nitrile, Viton and Tyre rubber. These results demonstrate SPR's potential to identify polymers and its ability to detect even pigmented materials, often challenging for other techniques. The imaging capabilities of the novel prism are presented, indicating its potential for future imaging of microplastics. Our approach holds promise for advancing microplastics analysis by enabling comprehensive assessment of particle parameters, such as polymer type, size, quantity and shape, and expanding the range of detectable polymer types.</description>

      <title>Imaging neutrons with a position-sensitive monolithic CLYC detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed and characterized a position-sensitive CLYC detector that acts as the neutron imaging layer and $\gamma$-ray Compton scatterer of the novel dual \g-ray and neutron imaging system GN-Vision, which aims at simultaneously obtaining information about the spatial origin of \g-ray and neutron sources. We first investigated the performance of large 50$\times$50~mm$^{2}$ monolithic CLYC crystals coupled to a pixelated SiPM in terms of energy resolution and neutron-gamma discrimination. The response of two different 95\% $^{6}$Li-enriched CLYC detectors coupled to an array of 8$\times$8 SiPMs was studied in comparison to the results of a conventional photo-multiplier tube. Energy resolution ranging from 6-8\% for the $^{137}$Cs peak and a figure of merit of 3-4 for the neutron-gamma discrimination have been obtained. The spatial response of the CLYC-SiPM detector to $\gamma$-rays and neutrons has also been characterized using charge modulation-based multiplexing techniques based on a diode-coupled charge division circuit. Average resolutions close to 5~mm FWHM with good linearity are obtained in the transverse crystal plane. Last, this work presents the first proof-of-concept experiments of the neutron imaging capability using a neutron pinhole collimator attached to the developed position sensitive CLYC detector.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage and recovery of plastic scintillators under ultra-high dose rate 200 MeV electrons at CERN CLEAR facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FLASH effect holds significant potential in improving radiotherapy treatment outcomes. Very high energy electrons (VHEEs) can effectively target tumors deep in the body and can be accelerated to achieve ultra-high dose rates (UHDR), making them a promising modality for delivering FLASH radiotherapy in the clinic. However, apart from suitable VHEE sources, clinical translation requires accurate dosimetry, which is challenging due to the limitation of standard dosimeters under UHDR. Water-equivalent and real-time plastic scintillation dosimeters (PSDs) may offer a solution. In this study, a 4-channel PSD, consisting of polystyrene-based BCF12 and Medscint proprietary scintillators, polyvinyltoluene (PVT)-based EJ-212 and a clear plastic fiber channel for Cherenkov subtraction was exposed to the 200 MeV VHEE UHDR beam at the CLEAR CERN facility. The Hyperscint RP200 platform was used to assess linearity to dose pulses of up to 90 Gy and dose rates up to 4.6x10$^9$ Gy/s, and to investigate radiation damage and recovery after dose accumulation of 37.2 kGy. While clear fiber response was linear across the entire dose range studied, light output saturated above ~50 Gy/pulse for scintillators. Despite radiation damage, linearity was preserved, though it resulted in a decrease of scintillator and clear fiber light output of &lt;1.85 %/kGy and a shift in spectra towards longer wavelengths. Short-term recovery (&lt;100h) of these changes was observed and depended on rest duration and accumulated dose. After long-term rest (&lt;172 days), light output recovery was partial, with 6-22% of residual permanent damage remaining, while spectral recovery was complete. We showed that PSDs are sensitive to radiation damage, but maintain dose linearity even after accumulated dose of 37.2 kGy, and exhibit significant response recovery. This work highlights the potential of PSDs for dosimetry in UHDR conditions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of muon flux behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A muon-flux measurement behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility was performed with a compact muon detector that can be inserted into a vertical observing hole with 81 mm in diameter which was dug underground. The detector consists of 12 plastic scintillation strips with a length of 80 mm each, which are arranged with cylindrical shape and contained inside an aluminum housing with an outer diameter of 75 mm. A silicon photomultiplier is coupled to the end of each strip to collect the scintillating light. The flux of the muons penetrating the beam dump was scanned vertically at intervals of 0.5 m, showing a wide distribution with a maximum at the beam level. The muon flux was consistent with the expectation from a Monte-Carlo simulation at more than 1 m away from the beam axis, which is expected to be used for signal-loss evaluation in the future KOTO II experiment for measuring rare kaon decays. The data can also be used in improving the accuracy of shielding calculations in the radiation protection.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Resonator with Electromagnetic Induced Absorption to Enable a Test of the Electric-Scalar Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cylindrical microwave cavity resonator operating in the TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode was excited using an interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude in the two interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the amplitude of the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these balanced conditions, the system demonstrated electromagnetically induced absorption in the cavity response due to the annulment of the electric field at the resonance frequency. This phenomena can be regarded as a form of extreme dispersion, and led to a measured increase in the cavity phase response by an order of magnitude. This work presents an experimental setup with the features that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Application of a Radon Diffusion Chamber for Determining Diffusion Coefficients in Membrane Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the issue of radon emanation and diffusion has become a critical concern for rare decay experiments, such as JUNO and PandaX-4T. This paper introduces a detector design featuring a symmetric radon detector cavity for the quantitative assessment of membrane materials' radon blocking capabilities. The performance of this design is evaluated through the application of Fick's Law and the diffusion equation considering material solubility. Our detector has completed measurements of radon diffusion coefficients for four types of membrane materials currently used in experiments, which also confirms the rationality of this detector design. The findings are instrumental in guiding the selection and evaluation of optimal materials for radon shielding to reduce radon background, contributing to boost sensitivities of rare event research.</description>

      <title>First Linearity and Stability Characterization for CZT Detection System in a e$^+$e$^-$ Collider Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SIDDHARTA-2 collaboration built a new cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT, CdZnTe)-based X-ray detection system, used for the first time in the DA$\Phi$NE electron-positron collider at INFN-LNF. The aim of this work is to show that these detectors present optimal long- and short-term linearity and stability to perform precise spectroscopic measurements in a collider environment. The spectra used as references for calibration are reported, and the results about the linearity and stability studies are presented. It is also discussed and showed what is the proper function to describe all the effects that alter the Gaussian shape in semiconductors, particularly evident in the CZT case. Good residuals and resolutions were obtained for all the calibrations. In a test run with the source and the collider beam on, it was demonstrated that the calibrations made with beam off are optimal also when the beam is on, and the actual systematics in a physics run were estimated. These promising results show the potentialities of this detector in the high rate environment of a particle collider, and pave the way for the use of CZT detectors in kaonic atoms researches and in accelerators, with applications for particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>TCAD Parameters for 4H-SiC: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>
