      <title>Microwave-driven multistability in a strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in a strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Impurities induced vortex lattice melting and turbulence in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of various impurities on rotating Bose-Einstein condensates confined within two-dimensional harmonic and optical lattice potentials. Without impurities, the rotating condensates display an organized square lattice pattern of vortices due to the influence of a square optical lattice. The introduction of impurity potentials disrupts this lattice structure, inducing a phase transition from an ordered state to a disordered state. Our analysis encompasses both static and dynamic types of impurities. The static impurities are implemented using a randomly varying potential with a spatially random amplitude. The transformation of the vortex lattice structure, in this case, relies on the strength and lattice constant of the impurity potential. For dynamical impurities, we employ a Gaussian obstacle that orbits around the condensate at a specific distance from its center. In this scenario, the vortex lattice melting occurs beyond a certain threshold radius and frequency of oscillation of the rotating obstacle. We characterize the melting of the vortex lattice due to impurities using various quantities, such as the structure factor and angular momentum. Notably, in the vortex-melted state, the angular momentum follows a power-law dependence with an exponent of approximately $1.73$, regardless of the type of impurity. Finally, we demonstrate the signature of the presence of a turbulent state within the vortex-melted state generated by both static and dynamical impurities.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, a scenario encountered in a wide range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. It is ready to be applied to a broad class of scatterings and, in particular, should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum scars in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions that carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped ``flag'' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that such uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (i) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (ii) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (iii) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave the way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthetic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>
