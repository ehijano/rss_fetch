      <title>Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13792v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.</description>

      <title>Twin-boundary-induced nonrelativistic spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in compensated magnetic materials is drawing considerable attention due to its potential impact in next-generation spintronic devices. While NRSS is typically restricted to materials with particular symmetry constraints, here we demonstrate, using density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding transport calculations, that twin boundaries can induce NRSS in magnetic systems where it is otherwise forbidden. We focus on two representative material systems: the tetragonal perovskite oxide BiCoO$_3$ with $90^{\circ}$ ferroelastic domain walls, and the rhombohedral layered delafossite-type oxide CoO$_2$, supporting $71^{\circ}$, $109^{\circ}$, and $135^{\circ}$ twin boundaries. Our results reveal that, if these boundaries coexist with ferromagnetic domain walls, they consistently produce NRSS similar to that of d-wave altermagnets, with nodal surfaces dictated by the underlying symmetry of the supercell containing the twin boundary. Tight-binding models further elucidate how the NRSS and derived transport properties scale with domain size and density. Our results put forward twin boundary engineering as a versatile route to realize and control spin splitting in a broader class of materials.</description>

      <title>Integrating electronic structure into generative modeling of inorganic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have introduced a new paradigm for the inverse design of inorganic materials, enabling the discovery of new crystalline structures with desired properties. However, existing generative models focus solely on structural aspects of materials during generation, while overlooking the underlying electronic behavior that fundamentally governs materials' stability and functionality. In this work, we present ChargeDIFF, the first generative model for inorganic materials that explicitly incorporates electronic structure into the generation process. Specifically, ChargeDIFF leverages charge density, a direct spatial representation of a material's electronic structure, as an additional modality for generation. ChargeDIFF demonstrates exceptional performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks compared to baseline models, with ablation studies revealing that this improvement is directly due to its ability to capture the material's electronic structure during generation. Moreover, the ability to control charge density during generation allows ChargeDIFF to introduce a novel inverse design method based on three-dimensional charge density, illustrating the potential to generate lithium-ion battery cathode materials with desired ion migration pathways, as validated by physics-based simulations. By highlighting the importance of accounting for electronic characteristics during material generation, ChargeDIFF offers new possibilities in the generative design of stable and functional materials.</description>

      <title>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity of Thermally Reduced Graphene Oxide: Compaction and Thermal Annealing Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature heat capacity of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO) as a function of compaction pressure and annealing temperature. Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\,{\deg}C, 500\,{\deg}C, and 700\,{\deg}C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials.</description>

      <title>Two-component anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in anisotropic Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of thin films Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N (x=0-1) was fabricated onto MgO substrates by magnetron sputtering with the aim of studying the possible enhancement of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), envisaged based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The Nernst and Hall effects of the series were systematically analyzed, complemented with resistivity, magnetic, electron microscopy and M\"ossbauer experiments, and DFT calculations including elastic properties. The Fe$_4$N phase crystallizes in the cubic symmetry with Pm3m space group, whereas a small tetragonal distortion is realized in for x&gt;0.35. From the comparison of the experimental isomer shift with DFT calculations, we conclude that Ge occupies the 4b site in the tetragonal I4/mcm tructure. Ferromagnetic T$_C$ decreases rapidly from 750 K for x=0 to 100 K for x=1. The tetragonal samples with x=0.8 and 1 display two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops, which can be analyzed as a sum of positive and negative loops with different saturation fields. This unusual behavior is a product of a combination of several factors. (1) Co-existence of two different crystallographic orientations in the tetragonal thin film, namely with the majority of c-axis and minority of a-axis normal to the film surface. (2) Opposite sign of the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects for the direction of magnetization along the a and c-axis revealed by DFT calculation. (3) The magnetocrystalline anisotropy characterized by an easy ab-plane, which is responsible for the different saturation fields for a and c-axis. The maximum ANE was determined to be 0.9 $\mu$V/K for x=0 at room temperature, and -0.85 $\mu$V/K for x=1 at T=50 K. The rapid increase of ANE of Fe$_3$GeN from low temperatures indicates that, were it not for its low T$_C$, it could surpass ANE of Fe$_4$N.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Precise, efficient and flexible modeling of crystallizing elastomers based on physics-augmented neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials and resembles a classical GSM-type equation. Two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced to ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, such that it can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled NR.</description>

      <title>Automated Prediction of Thermodynamic Properties via Bayesian Free-Energy Reconstruction from Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate free-energy calculations are essential for predicting thermodynamic properties and phase stability, but existing methods are limited: phonon-based approaches neglect anharmonicity and liquids, while molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding, neglects low-temperature quantum effects, and often requires manual planning and post-processing of simulations. We present a unified workflow that reconstructs the Helmholtz free-energy surface from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with zero-point energy corrections from harmonic/quasi-harmonic theory. The framework propagates statistical uncertainties, mitigates finite-size effects, and employs active learning to optimize sampling in the volume-temperature space. It applies seamlessly to both crystalline and liquid phases. We demonstrate the methodology by computing heat capacities, thermal expansion, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, and melting properties for nine elemental FCC and BCC metals using 20 classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials, with all predictions accompanied by quantified confidence intervals. Automated, general, and uncertainty-aware, the workflow advances high-throughput thermodynamics and provides a systematic benchmark for interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of attosecond tunnel ionization competes with disorder-driven decoherence in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a strong-field phenomenon that is sensitive to the attosecond dynamics of tunnel ionization and coherent transport of electron-hole pairs in solids. While the foundations of solid HHG have been established, a deep understanding into the nature of decoherence on sub-cycle timescales remains elusive. Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (&gt;250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Variational multiscale enrichment method for dynamic response of hyperelastic materials at finite deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we extend the variational multiscale enrichment (VME) method to model the dynamic response of hyperelastic materials undergoing large deformations. This approach enables the simulation of wave propagation under scale-inseparable conditions, including short-wavelength regimes, while accounting for material and geometric nonlinearities that lead to wave steepening or flattening. By employing an additive decomposition of the displacement field, we derive multiscale governing equations for the coarse- and fine-scale problems, which naturally incorporate micro-inertial effects. The framework allows the discretization of each unit cell with a patch of coarse-scale elements, which is essential to accurately capture wave propagation in short-wavelength regimes. An operator-split procedure is used to iteratively solve the semi-discrete equations at both scales until convergence is achieved. The coarse-scale problem is integrated explicitly, while the fine-scale problem is solved using either explicit or implicit time integration schemes, including both dissipative and non-dissipative methods. Numerical examples demonstrate that multiscale dissipative schemes effectively suppress spurious oscillations. The multiscale framework was applied to investigate how material and geometric nonlinearities, along with elastic stiffness contrast in heterogeneous microstructures, influence key wave characteristics such as dispersion, attenuation, and steepening. This multiscale computational framework provides a foundation for studying the dynamic response of architected materials.</description>

      <title>Lessons from $\alpha$-RuCl3 for pursuing quantum spin liquid physics in atomically thin materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</description>

      <title>On Universal Deformations and Material Preferred Directions in Anisotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study universal deformations in anisotropic Cauchy elasticity. We show that the universality constraints of hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic solids are equivalent. This implies that for each of these symmetry classes the universal deformations and the corresponding universal material preferred directions of hyperelastic and Cauchy elastic solids are identical. This is consistent with previous findings for isotropic solids. Universal deformations and material preferred directions are therefore independent of the existence or absence of a strain energy function.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity PIM-1 with explosive analytes at the molecular level: Combined experiment and computational modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the molecular-level interactions of a fluorescent microporous polymer (PIM-1) with nitroaromatic explosives, in the context of thin film explosive sensors. Thin films of the PIM-1 were exposed to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and their steady-state absorption and emission spectra measured. For comparison, the response of PIM-1 to non-explosive molecules such as benzene (BN) was also explored. Complementary electronic-structure calculations were used to predict absorption and emission spectra and to determine binding energies for the PIM-1-analyte complexes. The calculations agree well with experiment and reveal that association of nitroaromatic analyte molecules with PIM-1 alters the energy levels and the arrangements of frontier orbitals, indicating significant molecular interactions. Calculations show that the electronic properties and photo-excited electron transfer can be described by interaction with a single repeat unit of the polymer. The molecular binding, however, involves interaction with at least three repeat units, with the DNT or TNT molecule binding into a pocket in the contorted structure of the microporous polymer. Together, the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that PIM-1 is a promising platform for selective nitroaromatic detection and provide molecular design principles that could improve sensitivity and selectivity in future sensor materials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dielectric Function of Graphite Probed by Far- and Near-Field Spectroscopies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphite is a cornerstone material for revolutionary technologies, from energy storage to the entire field of two-dimensional materials. Despite its foundational role, the predictive power required for engineering emergent optical behavior in van der Waals heterostructures is severely constrained by persistent discrepancies in reported optical constants. We resolve this long-standing ambiguity by deploying a multi-modal approach that synergizes far-field spectroscopic ellipsometry with nanoscale near-field optical probing (s-SNOM) and micro-reflectance spectroscopy. We have established a new, self-consistent set of optical constants (n and k) for both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions across the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectrum. This work presents a unified set of optical constants that addresses inconsistencies in the existing literature. By establishing this definitive reference, we provide the essential foundation for the quantitative modeling and engineering of light-matter interactions in the evolving landscape of carbon-based nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Spin-singlet dimer phase in a frustrated square lattice under a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Ellipsometric Identification of Transition from Layered Metal-dielectric Film to Hyperbolic Metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. This is due to the difficulty in identifying versatile design parameters for HMM fabrication and characterization via accessible techniques. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry and numerical simulations are utilized to identify design parameters for fabrication of HMMs using the silver and alumina system as a model system. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations reveal internal tension in native state collagen fibrils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.</description>

      <title>Record Index-Bandgap Trade-off: CdPS3 as a High-Index van der Waals Platform for Ultraviolet-Visible Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of nanophotonics is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between a material's refractive index (n) and its electronic bandgap (Eg), which severely restricts the choice of materials for short-wavelength applications. This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces.</description>

Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</description>

      <title>MiAD: Mirage Atom Diffusion for De Novo Crystal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

      <title>Reflectivity-based refractive index measurement of van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic response properties of high-energy density (HED) systems influence planetary structure, drive evolution of fusion targets, and underpin diagnostics in laboratory astrophysics. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) offers a versatile modeling framework capable of accurately predicting the dynamic response of HED materials -- including free-free, bound-free, and bound-bound contributions without requiring ad hoc state partitioning; capturing both collective and non-collective behavior; and applicable within the linear-response regime and beyond. We review the theoretical formalism of real-time TDDFT as applied to HED systems, provide a practical tutorial for computing relevant response properties (dynamic structure factors, conductivity, and stopping power), and comment on avenues for further development of this powerful computational method in service of HED science.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons are desirable for applications in spintronics but their generation and control remains a challenge.Here we demonstrate the emergence of truly chiral phonons from selective magnon-phonon coupling in inversion-symmetric magnetic systems. Considering bcc Fe as example, we quantitatively calculate hybridized magnon-phonon quasiparticle states across the entire Brillouin zone utilizing first-principles calculations. Our findings challenge conventional magneto-elastic interpretations and reveal finite zero-point phonon angular momentum and strong anomalous thermal Hall responses linked to finite (spin) Berry curvatures. Our results further establish that the existence of chiral phonons, particularly along high-symmetry directions, is common in many magnetic materials, offering promising avenues for novel spintronic and phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Automated Materials Discovery Platform Realized: Scanning Probe Microscopy of Combinatorial Libraries</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries provide a powerful platform for mapping how physical properties evolve across binary and ternary cross-sections of multicomponent phase diagrams. While synthesis of such libraries has advanced since the 1960s and been accelerated by laboratory automation, their broader utility depends on rapid, quantitative measurements of composition-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning probe microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer unique potential for providing these functionally relevant, spatially resolved readouts. Here, we demonstrate a fully automated SPM framework for exploring ferroelectric properties across combinatorial libraries, focusing on binary Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO) and ternary Al$_{1-x-y}$Sc$_x$B$_y$N (Al,Sc,B)N systems. In SmBFO, automated exploration identifies the known morphotropic phase boundary with enhanced ferroelectric response and reveals a previously unreported double-peak fine structure. In the (Al,Sc,B)N library, ferroelectric behavior emerges at the phase-stability boundary, correlating with variations in morphology and defect concentration. By integrating automated SPM with wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and photoluminescence mapping, we resolve the composition-morphology-defect-property relationships underlying ferroelectric response and demonstrate a pathway toward a multi-tool, high-throughput characterization platform. Finally, we implement Gaussian-process-based single- and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to enable autonomous exploration, highlighting the Pareto front as a powerful framework for balancing competing physical rewards and accelerating data-driven physics discovery.</description>

      <title>A real-time approach to frequency-mixing spectroscopies: application to sum and difference frequency generation in two-dimensional crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational framework to extract non-linear response functions from real-time simulations in the presence of more than one external field. We apply this approach to the calculation of sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG). SFG and DFG are second-order nonlinear processes where two lasers with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ combine to produce a response at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2$. Compared with other nonlinear responses such as second-harmonic generation, SFG and DFG allow for tunability over a larger range. Moreover, the optical response can be enhanced by selecting the two laser frequencies in order to match specific electron-hole transitions. To assess the approach, we calculate the SFG and DFG of two-dimensional crystals, hBN and MoS2 monolayers, from real-time solution of an effective Schr\"odinger equation. Within the effective Schr\"odinger equation, one can select from various levels of theory for the effective one-particle Hamiltonian to account for local-field effects and electron-hole interactions. We compare results obtained within the independent-particle picture and including many-body effects. Such comparison allows us to identify and characterize excitonic features in the obtained spectra. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also extract higher-order response functions, such as field-induced second-harmonic generation. We provide an example using the hBN bilayer.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic materials represent an essential ingredient for the contemporary industry. Apart from common material parameters such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy, coercivity, or saturation magnetization, magnetoelastic behavior is vital for applications serving in various devices, e.g., in acoustic actuators, transducers, or sensors providing a desirable fast response and high efficiency with respect to applied magnetic field. Magnetoelastic properties have been studied for ferromagnetic 3d elements, or especially in high symmetry systems containing rare-earth elements to achieve higher values. Since, unlike for rare earth Laves phases, in the transition metals or alloys, these effects are very weak. Here, in contrast, we analyze the magnetoelastic behavior of antiferromagnetic tetragonal system MnPt, explaining the experimentally measured data based on the theoretical calculations and discussing the influence of the magnetic structure. Particularly, we inspect the origin of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, as well as the size and source of the isotropic and anisotropic parts of magnetoelastic (magnetostriction) coefficients.</description>

      <title>Self-trapped holes and acceptor impurities in orthorhombic Ga2O3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of self-trapped holes in kappa-phase orthorhombic Ga2O3 in conjunction with isoelectronic and acceptor dopants were studied using hybrid density functional theory. Hole trapping was found to be energetically favorable in all systems investigated and was further stabilized by acceptor dopants with large ionization energies. The electronic structures revealed emergent states in the band gap ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 eV above the valence band maximum, primarily composed of O 2p orbitals in all cases, with a notable contribution from Zn 3d orbitals in the Zn-doped system. Hole trapping resulted in a pronounced red shift and the emergence of additional absorption peaks, producing optical characteristics that were in closer agreement with experimental observations. In each system, the trapped hole localized near the dopant atom, predominantly on adjacent O atoms, accompanied by local lattice distortions. The valence band remained largely non-dispersive even in the presence of a hole; hole states lied near the Fermi level for isoelectronic dopants and deeper in the band gap for acceptor dopants. These findings indicate that isoelectronic doping may find an avenue for p-type doping in this polymorph of Ga2O3 if a means to mitigate self-compensation is found.</description>

      <title>Pseudopotentials, an overlooked source and remedy of DFT errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is hardly addressed. In this work, we show that most pseudopotentials to date introduce errors, which manifest themselves as errors of atomic energy levels, leading to a $de facto$ deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. We consider the atomic-level adjusted pseudopotentials, whose interplay with exchange-correlation functional provides a pragmatic correction that balances accuracy and efficiency. We benchmark our theory with bandgap calculation for 54 semiconductors containing monovalent Cu. The results, compared to those from conventional studies, not only remove all erroneous metal predictions for 11 compounds, but also reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. Overall accuracy even exceeds those of standard hybrid functionals and GW methods.</description>

      <title>Polarity and anti-distortive polarons in WO3 through epitaxial shear strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bestowing CMOS-compatible binary oxides with additional functionalities is a powerful strategy toward the realization of oxide electronics. Ideal candidates are thin films which display a strong sensitivity to strain, chemical doping or nanoscale confinement. Among these, crystalline tungsten trioxide WO3 exhibits exceptional structural flexibility, enabling a wide range of functionalities. Here, we reveal the emergence of a previously unreported polar phase in epitaxial WO3 thin films. We accomplish this by imposing epitaxial shear strain, which stabilizes a low-symmetry triclinic structure that persists up to large film thicknesses and elevated temperatures. At the atomic scale, a change in the oxygen octahedral tilt pattern facilitates this symmetry lowering into a polar phase, which manifests as a periodic in-plane polarized stripe domain configuration with needle-like bifurcations at the microscale. The stripe domain walls further exhibit a strongly enhanced electrical conductivity in conjunction with a pronounced reduction of a distortive structural mode, providing the first experimental evidence for the formation of anti-distortive polarons recently predicted in WO3.</description>

      <title>BaCd2P2: a promising impurity-tolerant counterpart of GaAs for photovoltaics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has been recently identified as a new solar absorber with promising optoelectronic properties. This work demonstrates that, despite having a low precursor purity (98.90% to 99.95%), synthesized BCP samples exhibit promising photoconductive carrier lifetime up to 300 ns and an implied open circuit voltage exceeding 1 V, comparable to a high-purity single-crystalline GaAs wafer. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the promising properties of BCP, its tolerance to intrinsic defects and extrinsic impurities is investigated using first-principles defect modeling and compared with the well-studied GaAs. The results show that the nonradiative recombination rates induced by dominant deep-level intrinsic antisite defects are lower in BCP than in GaAs under typical growth conditions. Further exploration of the impact of transition metal impurities in the raw materials used to make BCP and impurities introduced during its synthesis shows that most of these do not form deep-level nonradiative recombination centers. As an impurity-tolerant counterpart of GaAs, BCP demonstrates great potentials to improve the cost to performance ratio of photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Study of Surface Reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30{\deg} and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strongly oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Probing ice-rule-breaking transition in $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film by proximitized transport and magnetic torque</title>

Abstract: While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ (Yttria-stabilized Zirconia with 9.5 mol% $\rm{Y_2O_3}$) substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction ($\rm{J_{eff}}=$ 1.054 K) and distorted Ising spin axes ($\rm{\epsilon}=+0.051)$ compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise-reduction techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. We analyze the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems, where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE potential illustrate.</description>

      <title>Improved treatment of relativistic effects in linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method: application to Ac, Th, ThO2 and UO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce new radial dependencies for LAPW (Bloch-type) basis functions, based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential, assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore 6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density, associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up to 0.15~{\AA} and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in solid Ge.</description>

      <title>MicroEvoEval: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Image-Based Microstructure Evolution Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08955</link>

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>
