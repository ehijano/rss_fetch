      <title>The evolution of the phase space structure along pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations in a 3D galactic bar potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the phase space structure of a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system evolves across a series of successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations, as the transition of the parent families of periodic orbits (POs) from stability to simple instability leads to the creation of new stable POs. Our research illustrates the consecutive alterations in the phase space structure near POs as the stability of the main family of POs changes. This process gives rise to new families of POs within the system, either maintaining the same or exhibiting higher multiplicity compared to their parent families. Tracking such a phase space transformation is challenging in a 3D system. By utilizing the color and rotation technique to visualize the 4D Poincar'e surfaces of section of the system, i.e. projecting them onto a 3D subspace and employing color to represent the fourth dimension, we can identify distinct structural patterns. Perturbations of parent and bifurcating stable POs result in the creation of tori characterized by a smooth color variation on their surface. Furthermore, perturbations of simple unstable parent POs beyond the bifurcation point which lead to the birth of new stable families of POs, result in the formation of figure-8 structures of smooth color variations. These figure-8 formations surround well-shaped tori around the bifurcated stable POs, losing their well-defined forms for energies further away from the bifurcation point. We also observe that even slight perturbations of highly unstable POs create a cloud of mixed color points, which rapidly move away from the location of the PO. Our study introduces, for the first time, a systematic visualization of 4D surfaces of section within the vicinity of higher multiplicity POs. It elucidates how, in these cases, the coexistence of regular and chaotic orbits contributes to shaping the phase space landscape.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of digital memcomputing by jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the potential benefits of incorporating jumps into the dynamics of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs), which have been developed to address complex optimization problems. We illustrate the potential speed improvement of a DMM solver with jumps over an unmodified DMM solver by solving Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems of different complicatedness. Our findings suggest that jumps can modify scaling exponents and improve solving times by up to 75 %. Interestingly, the advantages of jumps can be seen in cases where the size of the jump is so large that otherwise the continuous dynamics of voltage variables becomes almost binary.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation and uncertainty quantification of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations in tandem, leveraging differentiable programming. Achieved through online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, this approach is enabled by the capabilities of differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for piecewise expanding maps in finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study weighted transfer operators associated to a piecewise expanding map on a compact manifold, and a piecewise Holder weight, acting on Sobolev spaces. We bound the essential spectral radius in terms of a topological pressure for a subadditive potential. Under a new small boundary pressure condition, we improve the estimate by establishing a variational principle for piecewise expanding maps and subadditive potentials. Version v2 is the electronic copy of the version to appear in DCDS</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent study of the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a perturbation $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-one matrix. First we report the complicated motions of the ``eigenvalues'' which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the equations which determine the exact-eigenvalue processes. Comparison between the numerical results and the solutions of the equations, coexistence of exact eigenvalues and pseudospectra in the numerical results is clarified. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe the specified exact eigenvalues. We tried to characterize the numerical results using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without perturbation. Then we report a new phenomenon in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve composed of several closed simple curves osculating each other is reduced in size and embedded as a complicated structure in the pseudospectrum. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Rigorously proven chaos in chemical kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a longstanding question regarding the mathematical proof of chaotic behavior in kinetic differential equations. Following the numerous numerical and experimental results in the past 50 years, we introduce two formal chemical reactions that rigorously demonstrate this behavior. Our approach involves transforming chaotic equations into kinetic differential equations and subsequently realizing these equations through formal chemical reactions. The findings present a novel perspective on chaotic dynamics within chemical kinetics, thereby resolving a longstanding open problem.</description>
