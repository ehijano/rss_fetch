      <title>Molecular simulations of Perovskites CsXI3 (X = Pb,Sn) Using Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cesium based halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, have emerged as exceptional candidates for next generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies, but their practical application is limited by temperature dependent phase transitions and structural instabilities. Here, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability, whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers, suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Improved operating voltage in InGaN-capped AlGaN-based DUV LEDs on bulk AlN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Better wall plug efficiency of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs) requires simultaneous low resistivity p-type and n-type contacts, which is a challenging problem. In this study, the co-optimization of p-InGaN and n- AlGaN contacts for DUV LEDs are investigated. We find that using a thin 7%InGaN cap is effective in achieving ohmic p-contacts with specific contact resistivity of 3.10x10^{-5} Ohm.cm^2. Upon monolithic integration of p- and n- contacts for DUV LEDs, we find that the high temperature annealing of 800C required for the formation of low resistance contacts to n-AlGaN severely degrades the p-InGaN layer, thereby reducing the hole concentration and increasing the specific contact resistivity to 9.72x10^{-4} Ohm.cm^2. Depositing a SiO2 cap by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) prior to high temperature n-contact annealing restores the low p-contact resistivity, enabling simultaneous low-resistance p- and n-contacts. DUV-LEDs emitting at 268 nm fabricated with the SiO2 capping technique exhibit a 3.5 V reduction in operating voltage at a current level of 400 A/cm^2 and a decrease in differential ON-resistance from 6.4 mOhm.cm^2 to 4.5 mOhm.cm^2. This study highlights a scalable route to high-performance, high-Al-content bipolar AlGaN devices.</description>

      <title>Stabilisation of hBN/SiC Heterostructures with Vacancies and Transition-Metal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two-dimensional atomic layers of different materials are brought into close proximity to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, interactions between adjacent layers significantly influence their physicochemical properties. These effects seem particularly pronounced when the interface exhibits local order and near-perfect structural alignment, leading to the emergence of Moir\'e patterns. Using quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations, we propose a prototypical bilayer heterostructure composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and silicon carbide (SiC), characterized by a lattice mismatch of 18.77\% between their primitive unit cells. We find that the removal of boron atoms from specific lattice sites can convert the interlayer interaction from weak vdW coupling to robust localized silicon-nitrogen covalent bonding. Motivated by this, we study the binding of transition-metal adatoms and formulate design guidelines to enhance surface reactivity, thereby enabling the controlled isolation of single-metal atoms. Our machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations confirm both dynamical stability and metal anchoring feasibility at finite temperatures. Our results suggest the hBN/SiC heterostructure as a versatile platform for atomically precise transition-metal functionalization, having potential for next-generation catalytic energy-conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Trichome entanglement enhances damage tolerance in microstructured biocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge in materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out (in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance through microstructural architecture.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Demonstration of Diamond-GaN pn Diodes via Grafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors exhibit exceptional electrical and thermal properties, offering strong potential for high power and high frequency electronics. However, efficient doping in UWBG materials is typically limited to either n type or p type, constraining their application to unipolar devices. The realization of pn junctions through heterogeneous integration of complementary UWBG or WBG semiconductors is hindered by lattice mismatch and thermal expansion differences. Here, we report the preliminary demonstration of diamond GaN heterojunction pn diodes fabricated via grafting. A single crystalline p plus diamond nanomembrane was integrated onto an epitaxially grown c plane n plus GaN substrate with an ultrathin ALD Al2O3 interlayer. The resulting diodes exhibit an ideality factor of 1.55 and a rectification ratio of over 1e4. Structural and interfacial properties were examined by AFM, XRD, Raman, and STEM, providing critical insights to guide further optimization of diamond GaN pn heterojunction devices.</description>

      <title>Percolating Corrosion Pathways of Chemically Ordered NiCr Alloys in Molten Salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that chemical ordering in NiCr alloys can significantly accelerate corrosion in molten salt environments. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using reactive molecular dynamics and first-principles calculations, we show that long-range ordered Ni$_2$Cr in Ni-33at.%Cr alloys corrodes far more rapidly in FLiNaK salt at 800{\deg}C than short-range ordered or random solid solutions. This accelerated attack originates from percolating Cr pathways that enhance near-surface diffusion and a lowered energetic barrier for Cr dissolution, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Contrary to earlier explanations that attributed this behavior to residual stresses, our stress-free simulations demonstrate that ordering alone accelerates the degradation. These results establish percolation as a critical link between chemical ordering and corrosion kinetics, offering a mechanistic basis for experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Pathway for Tuning Ferroelectric Properties via Polar State Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a geometric pathway for tuning ferroelectric properties through thermally driven reconfiguration between coexisting polar states in Li-substituted NaNbO3. Using first-principles density functional theory calculation and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement, we reveal that Li substitution creates two distinct polar configurations whose transformation under annealing enhances the Curie temperature and induces piezoelectric hardening. Our findings establish a geometrically-driven polar state reconfiguration mechanism, providing a general design principle for ferroics whereby macroscopic functional properties can be engineered via lattice geometry.</description>

      <title>Advanced structural characterization of single-walled carbon nanotubes with 4D-STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and electrical properties making them one of the most promising materials for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their electronic properties strongly depend on their chirality, i.e., their structural configuration, as well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of versatile and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT applications. Here, we report how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in SWCNT structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction patterns of SWCNTs. The resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the local chirality of multiple nanotubes at once, with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e-/{\AA}^2) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). We also show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube, while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM data enable to reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography. With this second approach, structural information can be obtained with atomic scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging. Finally, we investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further insight on nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging capabilities at atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Two Orders of Magnitude Enhancement in Oxide Ion Conductivity in Cu2P2O7 via Vanadium Substitution: A Pathway Toward SOFC Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest of green energy, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) have drawn considerable attention for chemical-to-electric energy conversion. In the present paper, we report an enhancement of ionic conductivity in Cu2P2-xVxO7 by vanadium substitution. The electrical (dc and ac conductivity, diffusivity, hopping rate, electric modulus and dielectric properties) and crystal structural properties of Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) are investigated by impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirms the presence of Cu2+, P5+and V5+ mono-valence states. The dc conductivity results reveal a two orders of magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity from ~3.81x10-5 S cm-1 for x =0 to ~2.08x10-3 S cm-1 for x =1 at 993 K, revealing a possible application in SOFCs. DC transport number studies reveal that the total conductivity is dominated by ionic conduction (&gt; 95%). In addition, the diffusivity and hopping rate of oxide ions increase with increasing x. Besides, ac conductivity, electric modulus and dielectric properties have been investigated to illustrate the microscopic conduction mechanism. The derived results suggest that the mechanism for ionic conduction is the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process. The soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns reveals the three-dimensional (3D) oxide ion conduction pathways within the crystal structure. The present study provides a pathway to enhance the ionic conductivity, as well as understanding of microscopic conduction mechanism, ionic conduction pathways and the role of crystal structure on the ionic conduction.</description>

      <title>Colloidal quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite nanosheets: synthesis and application as high-performance photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for non-toxic lead-free halide perovskites that can compete with the lead-based counterparts has led to the emergence of double perovskites as potential candidates. Among many options, Cs2AgBiBr6 stands out as one of the most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous optoelectronic applications. In this study, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared via the low-temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate high-performance photodetectors in a transport-layer-free architecture. The reaction temperature and ligands played vital roles in the structural purity, shape, and size of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs. The fabricated NSs disclosed lateral sizes of up to 1.4 um and are only a few nanometers thick. The high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs yielded a high detectivity (D) of 1.15*10^12 Jones, responsivity (R) of 121 mA/W, a notable on/off ratio of 2.39*10^4, and a fast rise and decay time of 857 and 829 us, respectively. The device demonstrates remarkable stability. Basically, it sustains its entire photocurrent after storage in ambient conditions for 80 days. This work showcases a pathway for the colloidal synthesis of quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 lead-free double perovskite NSs with suitable properties for high-performance photodetection and other optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Analysis of Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes of a Benzoxazolium-Coumarin Donor-\pi-Acceptor Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes that modulate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), we investigate a benzoxazolium-coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to ICT-relevant nuclear motions, demonstrating that THz-TDS provides a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.</description>

      <title>The Microscopic Nature of Orbital Disorder in LaMnO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a revised atomistic picture of the order-disorder transition in the archetypal orbital-ordered perovskite material, LaMnO$_{3}$. Our study uses machine-learning-driven molecular-dynamics simulations which describe the temperature evolution of pair distribution functions in close agreement with experiment. We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO$_{3}$ to comprise a mixture of differing structural distortions with and without inversion symmetry, implying a mixture of different orbital arrangements. These distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of $\sim 40$ fs at 1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional thermal motion in the high-$T$ phase - indicating that the electronic instability responsible for static Jahn-Teller distortions at low temperature instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures. Beyond LaMnO$_{3}$, our work opens an avenue for studying a wider range of correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Ferroelectric Phase Transitions from Machine-Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating finite temperature phase transitions from first-principles is computationally challenging. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have opened a new avenue for finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles accuracy. Here we use MLFFs, generated using on-the-fly training, to investigate structural phase transitions in four of the most well-studied ferroelectric oxides; BaTiO$_3$, PbTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$. Only using the 0 K ground state structure as input for the training, the resulting MLFFs can qualitatively predict all the main structural phases and phase transitions, while the quantitative results are sensitive to the choice of exchange correlation functional with PBEsol found to be more robust than LDA and r$^2$SCAN. MD simulations also reproduce the experimentally observed order-disorder character of Ti displacements in BaTiO$_3$, the abrupt first order transitions of BiFeO$_3$ and PbTiO$_3$, and the mixed order-disorder and displacive character of the ferroelectric transition in LiNbO$_3$. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of using MLFFs for simulating ferroelectric phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Combined ab initio and experimental study of phosphorus-based anti-wear additives interacting with iron and iron oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of phosphorus-based lubricant additives is governed by their adsorption, stability, and reactivity at the metal interface. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior and tribochemical stability of three additives: Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), and Amine Neutralized Acid Phosphate (ANAP). These additives are studied on iron and hematite surfaces using both ab initio calculations and experimental analyses on steel. Simulations revealed that ANAP exhibited the strongest adsorption on iron, followed by DBHP, while OAP showed weaker interactions, though its chemisorption was enhanced on hematite via hydrogen loss. Under tribological conditions, the DBHP phosphite dissociated more readily than the other two phosphates molecules due to its lower phosphorus coordination, as confirmed by bond order analysis. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements indicated significant differences in adsorption behavior across temperatures, with DBHP forming stable deposits, while ANAP exhibited poor retention, in agreement with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed DBHP's strong chemisorption and molecular dissociation, leading to increased phosphorus deposition. OAP, despite forming a phosphorus-based layer, caused a reduction in Fe oxide, consistent with its hydrogen release mechanism observed in simulations. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and oxidation state in tribofilm formation and stability. Understanding these interactions at the atomic level provides valuable insights for designing high-performance lubricant additives for extreme operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in KTaO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KTaO$_3$ (KTO) is an incipient ferroelectric, characterized by a softening of the lowest transverse optical (TO) mode with decreasing temperature. Cooper pairing in the recently discovered KTO-based heterostructures has been proposed to be mediated by the soft TO mode. Here we study the electron coupling to the zone-center odd-parity modes of bulk KTO by means of relativistic Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). The coupling to the soft TO mode is by far the largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and interband processes. Remarkably, we find that for this mode, spin-non-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant. We develop a three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled $t_{2g}$ orbitals that reproduces the main features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy band, the coupling can be understood as a "dynamical" isotropic Rashba effect. In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling becomes strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the calculation of the full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode of interest, and it is easily applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>Dual quantum locking: Dynamic coupling of hydrogen and water sublattices in hydrogen filled ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit exceptionally strong host-guest interactions due to ultra-short H2-H2O distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear quantum effects involving both hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure- and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics,
  quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides new insights into the quantum behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic emittance properties of an Fe-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode: Ultracold electron emission at 300K and the polaron self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy (MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon (FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in the initial photoexcited electron thermalization.</description>

      <title>Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part I -- Experimental Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZBLAN glass is a promising material for infrared optical fibers due to its wide transmission window and low theoretical attenuation. However, its strong tendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While microgravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role of mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and vibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational conditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results show that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis corroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial thermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results confirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a purely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced crystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation for follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and microgravity conditions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a conventional tight-binding model for graphene, where distortion of the honeycomb lattice is allowed, but penalized by a quadratic energy. We prove that the optimal 3-periodic lattice configuration has Kekul\'e O-type symmetry, and that for a sufficiently small elasticity parameter, the minimizer is not translation-invariant. Conversely, we prove that for a large elasticity parameter the translation-invariant configuration is the unique minimizer.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to modelling the properties of HEMTs operating in the saturation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the ASM-HEMT model, QPZD model and EPFL model are all based on the three-terminal potential as the core, and relate the electrical characteristics such as I-V and C-V to Vd, Vs and Vg, so as to accurately build the HEMT model with high accuracy and fast convergence. However, there has not yet been a model based on three-terminal potentials that can quickly model the velocity saturation effect as well as the carrier concentration distribution and the electric field distribution inside the HEMT, which makes the existing models have to rely on a number of empirical parameters in the modelling process, which lacks the actual physical significance. In previous publications, models for the electric field, carrier concentration distribution based on the effective length of the gate were presented. In this paper, the model proposed in previous publications is improved to enable: (1) the calculation of the current Ids without relying on the Newton iterative method with fast simulation convergence behavior; (2) The Vdsat when the HEMT reaches saturation at different Vgo is redefined instead of using Vdsat = Vgo; (3) The expression of the v-E relationship is redefined relying on the different transport of carriers, which solves the problem of the large model error of the electric field distribution in the region below the gate, and makes the model's accuracy of the I-V characteristic further improved. The model was validated by characterising the I-V and E-V of the HEMT through TCAD simulation with RMSE below 5%.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Hyperelastic Constitutive Laws from Experimental Data with EUCLID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the performance of EUCLID, Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery, a recently proposed framework for automated discovery of constitutive laws, on experimental data. Mechanical tests are performed on natural rubber specimens spanning simple to complex geometries, from which we collect both global, force elongation, and local, full-field displacement, measurements. Using these data, we obtain constitutive laws via two routes, the conventional identification of unknown parameters in a priori selected material models, and EUCLID, which automates model selection and parameter identification within a unified model-discovery pipeline. We compare the two methodologies using global versus local data, analyze predictive accuracy, and examine generalization to unseen geometries. Moreover, we quantify the experimental noise, investigate the coverage of the material state space achieved by each approach and discuss the relative performance of different datasets and different a priori chosen models versus EUCLID.</description>

      <title>Accurate Reporting of Ion Time-of-Flight during HiPIMS with Gated Front-End Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) deposited films can often improve through the effective use of metal-ion acceleration, requiring precise measurements of time-of-flight (ToF). These measurements are commonly done using time- and energy-resolved mass spectrometry but require careful consideration of the transit time of ions inside. The transit time is typically calculated by considering the travel length in various parts of the spectrometer (e.g. from orifice to detector), but errors associated with these estimations can lead to nonphysical values in a HiPIMS process (e.g. negative ToFs). Here we report a practical approach to determine ion ToF experimentally, using a bipolar HiPIMS power supply to synchronize a gating pulse to the front-end of a HIDEN Analytical EQP-300 mass spectrometer, placed at the working distance. The ToF is measured by applying a +70 V bias to repel ions, and a 5 us gating pulse of 0 V to accept them. To prevent interference with the HiPIMS plasma, a grounded shield is placed in front of the mass-spec head with a variable slit-opening (0.5-3 mm). The effectiveness of the shielding is verified by Langmuir probe measurements, noting negligible shifts in plasma potential for a DC sputter discharge. The gate is then synchronized to a HiPIMS pulse and data collected at 5 us intervals by adjusting the pulse delay. Measurements of the time-of-flights of Ar+, Al+, Sc+, Y+, and W+ ions are presented; Al+ and Ar+ ions were also compared to ToF calculated using mass spectrometry flight tube equations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Spectral Diffusion in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectra via the Projection Slice Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust and streamlined method is presented for efficiently extracting spectral diffusion from two-dimensional coherent spectra by employing the projection-slice theorem. The method is based on the optical Bloch equations for a single resonance that include a Frequency-Frequency Correlation Function (FFCF) in the time domain. Through the projection slice theorem (PST), analytical formulation of the diagonal and cross-diagonal projections of time-domain two-dimensional spectra are calculated that include the FFCF for arbitrary inhomogeneity. The time-domain projections are Fourier transformed to provide frequency domain slices that can be fit to slices of experimental spectra. Experimental data is used to validate our lineshape analysis and confirm the need for the inclusion of the FFCF for quantum wells that experience spectral diffusion.</description>

      <title>Classically Prepared, Quantumly Evolved: Hybrid Algorithm for Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to compute dynamical correlation functions and excitation spectra in many-body quantum systems, with a focus on molecular systems. The method combines classical preparation of a perturbed ground state with short-time quantum evolution of product states sampled from it. The resulting quantum samples define an effective subspace of the Hilbert space, onto which the Hamiltonian is projected to enable efficient classical simulation of long-time dynamics. This subspace-based approach achieves high-resolution spectral reconstruction using shallow circuits and few samples. Benchmarks on molecular systems show excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and demonstrate access to dynamical timescales beyond the reach of purely classical methods, highlighting its suitability for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Hydrogen and Helium: From Planetary Embryos to Earth- and Neptune-like Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate single shot al optical switching (AOS) in rare earth free CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a material system widely adopted in spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM). By tuning the capping layer thickness, we show that precise heat control enables deterministic magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP) state. Furthermore, we detect magnetization reversal in a micro scale MTJ device via the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Our findings suggest that ultrafast spin transport or dipolar interactions or a combination of both may play essential roles in the switching process. This work represents a significant step toward integrating AOS with MTJ technology.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on critical exponents of the classical Heisenberg model in ferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) lack three-dimensional periodicity of atomic arrangement but possess long-range structural order, which are distinct from periodic crystals and random systems. Here, we show how the ferromagnetic (FM) order arises in the icosahedral QC (i-QC) on the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation of the Heisenberg model on the Yb lattice of Cd$_{5.7}$Yb composed of regular icosahedrons. By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the critical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin correlation length, $\beta=0.508(30)$, $\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\nu=0.792(17)$, respectively. We confirmed that our data satisfy the hyperscaling relation and estimated the other critical exponents $\alpha=-0.376(51)$, $\delta=3.68(23)$, and $\eta=0.282(65)$. These results show a new universality class inherent in the i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses. In the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified into 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We revealed the FM-transition mechanism by showing that the difference in the local environment of each site is governed by cooperative evolution of spin correlations upon cooling, giving rise to the critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Correlated Charge-Ordered Phases in 1T-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for controlling the structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional materials, particularly in systems hosting charge density wave (CDW) order. In this work, we apply uniaxial tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS2 flakes using a flexible, device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent behavior of the nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase transition. This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature. Electrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the strain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that piezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window. These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain and displacement.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>

      <title>Effects of interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the shape and dynamics of magnetic twin-skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.</description>

      <title>Second-order Stark shifts exceeding 10$\,$GHz in electrically contacted SiV$^-$ centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$) in diamond exhibit excellent spin coherence and optical properties, making them promising candidates for quantum technologies. However, the strain-induced inhomogeneous distribution of optical transition frequencies poses a challenge for scalability. We demonstrate electrical tuning of the SiV$^-$ center zero-phonon lines using in-plane contacts to apply moderate electric fields up to 45$\,$MV/m. The second-order Stark shift exceeds 10$\,$GHz, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 15$\,$GHz inhomogeneous distribution of SiV$^-$ observed in emitters embedded in optical nanostructures such as photonic crystal nanocavities. Analysis of individual SiV$^-$ centers shows significant variation in polarizabilities between defects indicating that the polarizability strongly depends on local parameters like strain. The observed polarizabilities are 3-25 times larger than those of tin vacancy centers, which we attribute to valence band resonances that delocalize the $e_u$ wavefunctions. Photoluminescence excitation measurements reveal that optical linewidths increase moderately with applied electric field strength. Our results demonstrate that large electrical Stark shifts can overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of transition frequencies, representing a significant step toward scalable SiV$^-$-based quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Over 3 kV and Ultra-Low leakage Vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Power Diodes with Engineered Schottky Contact and High-permittivity Dielectric Field Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and high-permittivity (\k{appa}) dielectric (ZrO2) field plate. The (011) orientation of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift layers which are promising to support kV-class vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power switches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a co-processed Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same wafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the field-plate Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown voltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage, edge field reduction by high-\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as the advantageous material properties offered by (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate a promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.</description>

Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale morphological evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no version of this approach that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. Leveraging molecular coarse-graining, we describe the formulation of an order parameter-based free energy functional appropriate for a phase-field description via the enhanced sampling of rare events. We demonstrate our approach on ice nucleation dynamics, achieving a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models and systematically bridges the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>Cluster spin glass correlations and dynamics in Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a magnetometry, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron scattering study of the insulating face-centered-cubic spin glass Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te. The magnetometry and $\mu$SR results confirm a spin freezing transition around $T_f \approx 23$ K, with the spin fluctuation rate decreasing gradually and somewhat inhomogeneously through the sample volume as the temperature decreases toward $T_f$. Characteristic spin correlation times well above $T_f$ are on the order of 10$^{-10}$ s, in line with expectations for a cluster spin glass. Using magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the magnetic diffuse neutron scattering data, we show that the spin-glass ground state consists of clusters of spins exhibiting short-range-ordered type-III antiferromagnetic correlations, with a locally ordered moment of 3.1(1) $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ between nearest-neighbor spins. The type-III correlations decay exponentially as a function of spin separation distance with a correlation length of approximately 5 \AA. The diffuse magnetic scattering and corresponding mPDF show no significant changes across $T_f$, indicating that the dynamically fluctuating short-range spin correlations in the paramagnetic state retain the same basic type-III configuration; the only change apparent from the neutron scattering data is a gradual reduction of the correlation length and locally ordered moment with increasing temperature. Taken together, these results paint a unique and detailed picture of the local magnetic structure and dynamics in Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te and show that this material is best described as a cluster spin glass. In addition, this work showcases a statistical method for extracting diffuse scattering signals from neutron powder diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Incongruent Melting and Phase Diagram of SiC from Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is an important technological material, but its high-temperature phase diagram has remained unclear due to conflicting experimental results about congruent versus incongruent melting. Here, we employ large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to gain insights into SiC decomposition and phase transitions. Our approach relies on a Bayesian active learning workflow to efficiently train an accurate machine learning force field on density functional theory data. Our large-scale simulations provide direct indication that melting of SiC proceeds incongruently via decomposition into silicon-rich and carbon phases at high temperature and pressure. During cooling at high pressures, carbon nanoclusters nucleate and grow within the homogeneous molten liquid. During heating, the decomposed mixture reversibly transitions back into a homogeneous SiC liquid. The full pressure-temperature phase diagram of SiC is systematically constructed using MLMD simulations, providing new understanding of the nature of phases, resolving long-standing inconsistencies from previous experiments and yielding technologically relevant implications for processing and deposition of this material.</description>

      <title>Spin Texture Control and Magnetic Gap Engineering in a Ferromagnetic Insulator-Topological Insulator Sandwiched Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</description>

Abstract: The control of antiferromagnetic order can pave the way to large storage capacity as well as fast manipulation of stored data. Here achieving a steady-state of sublattice magnetization after switching is crucial to prevent loss of stored data. The present theoretical approach aims to obtain instantaneous stable states of the order after reorienting the N\'eel vector in open quantum antiferromagnets using time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory. The Lindblad formalism is employed to couple the system to the environment. The quantum theoretical approach comprises differences in the effects of dephasing, originating from destructive interference of different wave vectors, and spin-lattice relaxation. We show that the spin-lattice relaxation results in an exponentially fast convergence to the steady-state after full ultrafast switching.</description>

      <title>An accurate DFT-1/2 approach for shallow defect states: Efficient calculation of donor binding energies in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of shallow-donor electron binding energies is critical for device modeling, dopant activation, and donor-based quantum technologies. Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT) approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique.</description>

Abstract: It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a
  ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic
  theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor
  magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a
  nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of
  the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to
  pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a
  centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the
  second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency
  generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation
  (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the
  spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin
  moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular
  magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic
  structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the
  difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we
  show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd,
  in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization
  simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible
  NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a
  manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid
  theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among
  different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations,
  representing a significant step forward.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the Impact of Local Host Effects on TADF Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Donor-acceptor (D-A) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), a key technology of proposed Gen3 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), is highly sensitive to the rigidity and polarity of the local environment. Specifically, the torsional flexibility of the D-A dihedral angle and the dipole character of charge transfer states give rise to a distribution of TADF dynamics across the emitter ensemble. Here, we employ single molecule spectroscopy to access the photophysics of individual emitters, thus overcoming the limitations of ensemble averaging. Using photon correlation measurements and locally resolved spectral data from single D-A type TADF molecules embedded in host materials of different polarity and rigidity, we derive host-dependent characteristics and distributions in the TADF dynamics. These are directly linked to local conformational freedom and dielectric properties, offering new insight into host-emitter interactions and enabling rational design strategies for optimized host-emitter combinations in OLED applications.</description>

      <title>Silk-Nano-Fibroin Aerogels: A Bio-Derived, Amine-Rich Platform for Rapid and Reversible CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in bio-based materials, rapid, low-temperature CO2 capture using amine-rich natural sorbents has received limited attention. In recent years, various porous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, sluggish adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain major challenges for their practical implementation. Here, we present silk-nano-fibroin aerogels derived from natural mulberry silk as a sustainable, amine-rich, and support-free sorbent platform for energy-efficient CO2 capture. The aerogels exhibit a CO2 adsorption capacity competitive with state-of-the-art amino acid and amino acid ionic liquid-based solid sorbents. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms high thermal stability up to 250C, substantially higher than that of conventional amine sorbents, while complete sorbent regeneration occurs at only 60 C. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin aerogels demonstrate rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, excellent multicycle stability, and full retention of CO2 adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Spectroscopic analyses (XPS, FTIR, Raman, and solid-state 13C NMR) confirm reversible CO2 chemisorption through intrinsic amine sites within the silk-fibroin backbone. Overall, this work establishes silk-nano-fibroin aerogels as a sustainable and low-cost route toward energy-efficient CO2 capture.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of coercivity for isolated Ni nanowires unraveled by high-sensitivity micromagnetometry</title>

Abstract: Magnetic nanowires are critical components in fields such as data storage and spintronics, where precise control of their magnetic properties is essential for device optimization. In particular, the behavior of isolated nanowires is often different from that of an ensemble, offering an opportunity to explore the role that dipolar and magnetoelastic interactions play in the latter system. Unfortunately, the comparison between a collection of nanowires and single ones is often poorly characterized, as measuring individual nanowires with weak magnetic signals is a challenging task. In this work, we employ a highly-sensitive micromechanical torsional oscillator to measure the magnetic response of few individual Ni nanowires with 72 +/- 5 nm average diameter, fabricated by electrodeposition in anodic aluminum oxide templates as an array and subsequently released from this membrane. When comparing the magnetic properties as a function of temperature between single nanowires and the array, we show that coercivity values of individual nanowires are at least twice as large as for the array in the range 5 K - 200 K. Also, we characterize the differences in the hysteresis loops, which are more squared for isolated nanowires, with a high magnetic remanence close to 80 % of the saturation value. Our results highlight the crucial role of dipolar and mechanical interactions in modifying the magnetic behavior of nanowires arrays, providing valuable insights for the design and application of nanowires-based magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Non-equilibrium Structures of Active Dipolar Particles by an External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</description>

      <title>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>
