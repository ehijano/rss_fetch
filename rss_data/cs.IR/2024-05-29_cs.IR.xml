      <title>RAGSys: Item-Cold-Start Recommender as RAG System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) hold immense promise for real-world applications, but their generic knowledge often falls short of domain-specific needs. Fine-tuning, a common approach, can suffer from catastrophic forgetting and hinder generalizability. In-Context Learning (ICL) offers an alternative, which can leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide LLMs with relevant demonstrations for few-shot learning tasks. This paper explores the desired qualities of a demonstration retrieval system for ICL. We argue that ICL retrieval in this context resembles item-cold-start recommender systems, prioritizing discovery and maximizing information gain over strict relevance. We propose a novel evaluation method that measures the LLM's subsequent performance on NLP tasks, eliminating the need for subjective diversity scores. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of diversity and quality bias in retrieved demonstrations for effective ICL, and highlight the potential of recommender system techniques in this domain.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Textual Generation via Topology Aware Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating text, they are often limited by the knowledge contained in the input and prone to producing inaccurate or hallucinated content. To tackle these issues, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is employed as an effective strategy to enhance the available knowledge base and anchor the responses in reality by pulling additional texts from external databases. In real-world applications, texts are often linked through entities within a graph, such as citations in academic papers or comments in social networks. This paper exploits these topological relationships to guide the retrieval process in RAG. Specifically, we explore two kinds of topological connections: proximity-based, focusing on closely connected nodes, and role-based, which looks at nodes sharing similar subgraph structures. Our empirical research confirms their relevance to text relationships, leading us to develop a Topology-aware Retrieval-augmented Generation framework. This framework includes a retrieval module that selects texts based on their topological relationships and an aggregation module that integrates these texts into prompts to stimulate LLMs for text generation. We have curated established text-attributed networks and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance RAG with topological awareness.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cultural Inclusivity: Optimizing Embedding Spaces for Balanced Music Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias in music recommendation systems -- where artists and tracks with the highest listen counts are recommended more often -- can also propagate biases along demographic and cultural axes. In this work, we identify these biases in recommendations for artists from underrepresented cultural groups in prototype-based matrix factorization methods. Unlike traditional matrix factorization methods, prototype-based approaches are interpretable. This allows us to directly link the observed bias in recommendations for minority artists (the effect) to specific properties of the embedding space (the cause). We mitigate popularity bias in music recommendation through capturing both users' and songs' cultural nuances in the embedding space. To address these challenges while maintaining recommendation quality, we propose two novel enhancements to the embedding space: i) we propose an approach to filter-out the irrelevant prototypes used to represent each user and item to improve generalizability, and ii) we introduce regularization techniques to reinforce a more uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing popularity bias and enhancing demographic and cultural fairness in music recommendations while achieving competitive -- if not better -- overall performance.</description>

      <title>Generative Query Reformulation Using Ensemble Prompting, Document Fusion, and Relevance Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query Reformulation (QR) is a set of techniques used to transform a user's original search query to a text that better aligns with the user's intent and improves their search experience. Recently, zero-shot QR has been a promising approach due to its ability to exploit knowledge inherent in large language models. Inspired by the success of ensemble prompting strategies which have benefited other tasks, we investigate if they can improve query reformulation. In this context, we propose two ensemble-based prompting techniques, GenQREnsemble and GenQRFusion which leverage paraphrases of a zero-shot instruction to generate multiple sets of keywords to improve retrieval performance ultimately. We further introduce their post-retrieval variants to incorporate relevance feedback from a variety of sources, including an oracle simulating a human user and a "critic" LLM. We demonstrate that an ensemble of query reformulations can improve retrieval effectiveness by up to 18% on nDCG@10 in pre-retrieval settings and 9% on post-retrieval settings on multiple benchmarks, outperforming all previously reported SOTA results. We perform subsequent analyses to investigate the effects of feedback documents, incorporate domain-specific instructions, filter reformulations, and generate fluent reformulations that might be more beneficial to human searchers. Together, the techniques and the results presented in this paper establish a new state of the art in automated query reformulation for retrieval and suggest promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>RREH: Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing for Semi-Paired Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known for efficient computation and easy storage, hashing has been extensively explored in cross-modal retrieval. The majority of current hashing models are predicated on the premise of a direct one-to-one mapping between data points. However, in real practice, data correspondence across modalities may be partially provided. In this research, we introduce an innovative unsupervised hashing technique designed for semi-paired cross-modal retrieval tasks, named Reconstruction Relations Embedded Hashing (RREH). RREH assumes that multi-modal data share a common subspace. For paired data, RREH explores the latent consistent information of heterogeneous modalities by seeking a shared representation. For unpaired data, to effectively capture the latent discriminative features, the high-order relationships between unpaired data and anchors are embedded into the latent subspace, which are computed by efficient linear reconstruction. The anchors are sampled from paired data, which improves the efficiency of hash learning. The RREH trains the underlying features and the binary encodings in a unified framework with high-order reconstruction relations preserved. With the well devised objective function and discrete optimization algorithm, RREH is designed to be scalable, making it suitable for large-scale datasets and facilitating efficient cross-modal retrieval. In the evaluation process, the proposed is tested with partially paired data to establish its superiority over several existing methods.</description>

      <title>Dataset Regeneration for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential recommender (SR) system is a crucial component of modern recommender systems, as it aims to capture the evolving preferences of users. Significant efforts have been made to enhance the capabilities of SR systems. These methods typically follow the \textbf{model-centric} paradigm, which involves developing effective models based on fixed datasets. However, this approach often overlooks potential quality issues and flaws inherent in the data. Driven by the potential of \textbf{data-centric} AI, we propose a novel data-centric paradigm for developing an ideal training dataset using a model-agnostic dataset regeneration framework called DR4SR. This framework enables the regeneration of a dataset with exceptional cross-architecture generalizability. Additionally, we introduce the DR4SR+ framework, which incorporates a model-aware dataset personalizer to tailor the regenerated dataset specifically for a target model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the data-centric paradigm, we integrate our framework with various model-centric methods and observe significant performance improvements across four widely adopted datasets. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analyses to explore the potential of the data-centric paradigm and provide valuable insights.

      <title>Learn to be Fair without Labels: a Distribution-based Learning Framework for Fair Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking algorithms as an essential component of retrieval systems have been constantly improved in previous studies, especially regarding relevance-based utilities. In recent years, more and more research attempts have been proposed regarding fairness in rankings due to increasing concerns about potential discrimination and the issue of echo chamber. These attempts include traditional score-based methods that allocate exposure resources to different groups using pre-defined scoring functions or selection strategies and learning-based methods that learn the scoring functions based on data samples. Learning-based models are more flexible and achieve better performance than traditional methods. However, most of the learning-based models were trained and tested on outdated datasets where fairness labels are barely available. State-of-art models utilize relevance-based utility scores as a substitute for the fairness labels to train their fairness-aware loss, where plugging in the substitution does not guarantee the minimum loss. This inconsistency challenges the model's accuracy and performance, especially when learning is achieved by gradient descent. Hence, we propose a distribution-based fair learning framework (DLF) that does not require labels by replacing the unavailable fairness labels with target fairness exposure distributions. Experimental studies on TREC fair ranking track dataset confirm that our proposed framework achieves better fairness performance while maintaining better control over the fairness-relevance trade-off than state-of-art fair ranking frameworks.</description>

      <title>The Impacts of Data, Ordering, and Intrinsic Dimensionality on Recall in Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector search systems, pivotal in AI applications, often rely on the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm. However, the behaviour of HNSW under real-world scenarios using vectors generated with deep learning models remains under-explored. Existing Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) benchmarks and research typically has an over-reliance on simplistic datasets like MNIST or SIFT1M and fail to reflect the complexity of current use-cases. Our investigation focuses on HNSW's efficacy across a spectrum of datasets, including synthetic vectors tailored to mimic specific intrinsic dimensionalities, widely-used retrieval benchmarks with popular embedding models, and proprietary e-commerce image data with CLIP models. We survey the most popular HNSW vector databases and collate their default parameters to provide a realistic fixed parameterisation for the duration of the paper.
  We discover that the recall of approximate HNSW search, in comparison to exact K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) search, is linked to the vector space's intrinsic dimensionality and significantly influenced by the data insertion sequence. Our methodology highlights how insertion order, informed by measurable properties such as the pointwise Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) or known categories, can shift recall by up to 12 percentage points. We also observe that running popular benchmark datasets with HNSW instead of KNN can shift rankings by up to three positions for some models. This work underscores the need for more nuanced benchmarks and design considerations in developing robust vector search systems using approximate vector search algorithms. This study presents a number of scenarios with varying real world applicability which aim to better increase understanding and future development of ANN algorithms and embedding</description>

      <title>SLMRec: Empowering Small Language Models for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential Recommendation (SR) task involves predicting the next item a user is likely to interact with, given their past interactions. The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation. Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene. Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily. In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets. Surprisingly, we discover that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant. Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method. Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models, while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Attention-based sequential recommendation system using multimodal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems that model dynamic preferences based on a use's past behavior are crucial to e-commerce. Recent studies on these systems have considered various types of information such as images and texts. However, multimodal data have not yet been utilized directly to recommend products to users. In this study, we propose an attention-based sequential recommendation method that employs multimodal data of items such as images, texts, and categories. First, we extract image and text features from pre-trained VGG and BERT and convert categories into multi-labeled forms. Subsequently, attention operations are performed independent of the item sequence and multimodal representations. Finally, the individual attention information is integrated through an attention fusion function. In addition, we apply multitask learning loss for each modality to improve the generalization performance. The experimental results obtained from the Amazon datasets show that the proposed method outperforms those of conventional sequential recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Source Echo Chamber: Exploring the Escalation of Source Bias in User, Data, and Recommender System Feedback Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, researchers have uncovered that neural retrieval models prefer AI-generated content (AIGC), called source bias. Compared to active search behavior, recommendation represents another important means of information acquisition, where users are more prone to source bias. Furthermore, delving into the recommendation scenario, as AIGC becomes integrated within the feedback loop involving users, data, and the recommender system, it progressively contaminates the candidate items, the user interaction history, and ultimately, the data used to train the recommendation models. How and to what extent the source bias affects the neural recommendation models within feedback loop remains unknown. In this study, we extend the investigation of source bias into the realm of recommender systems, specifically examining its impact across different phases of the feedback loop. We conceptualize the progression of AIGC integration into the recommendation content ecosystem in three distinct phases-HGC dominate, HGC-AIGC coexist, and AIGC dominance-each representing past, present, and future states, respectively. Through extensive experiments across three datasets from diverse domains, we demonstrate the prevalence of source bias and reveal a potential digital echo chamber with source bias amplification throughout the feedback loop. This trend risks creating a recommender ecosystem with limited information source, such as AIGC, being disproportionately recommended. To counteract this bias and prevent its escalation in the feedback loop, we introduce a black-box debiasing method that maintains model impartiality towards both HGC and AIGC. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed debiasing method, confirming its potential to disrupt the feedback loop.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Recommender Systems: Cluster-based Algorithm Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster-based algorithm selection deals with selecting recommendation algorithms on clusters of users to obtain performance gains. No studies have been attempted for many combinations of clustering approaches and recommendation algorithms. We want to show that clustering users prior to algorithm selection increases the performance of recommendation algorithms. Our study covers eight datasets, four clustering approaches, and eight recommendation algorithms. We select the best performing recommendation algorithm for each cluster. Our work shows that cluster-based algorithm selection is an effective technique for optimizing recommendation algorithm performance. For five out of eight datasets, we report an increase in nDCG@10 between 19.28% (0.032) and 360.38% (0.191) compared to algorithm selection without prior clustering.</description>

      <title>ReChorus2.0: A Modular and Task-Flexible Recommendation Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the applications of recommendation systems rapidly expanding, an increasing number of studies have focused on every aspect of recommender systems with different data inputs, models, and task settings. Therefore, a flexible library is needed to help researchers implement the experimental strategies they require. Existing open libraries for recommendation scenarios have enabled reproducing various recommendation methods and provided standard implementations. However, these libraries often impose certain restrictions on data and seldom support the same model to perform different tasks and input formats, limiting users from customized explorations. To fill the gap, we propose ReChorus2.0, a modular and task-flexible library for recommendation researchers. Based on ReChorus, we upgrade the supported input formats, models, and training&amp;evaluation strategies to help realize more recommendation tasks with more data types. The main contributions of ReChorus2.0 include: (1) Realization of complex and practical tasks, including reranking and CTR prediction tasks; (2) Inclusion of various context-aware and rerank recommenders; (3) Extension of existing and new models to support different tasks with the same models; (4) Support of highly-customized input with impression logs, negative items, or click labels, as well as user, item, and situation contexts. To summarize, ReChorus2.0 serves as a comprehensive and flexible library better aligning with the practical problems in the recommendation scenario and catering to more diverse research needs. The implementation and detailed tutorials of ReChorus2.0 can be found at https://github.com/THUwangcy/ReChorus.</description>

      <title>Unified Low-rank Compression Framework for Click-through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models play an important role in modern industrial recommendation scenarios. However, high memory overhead and computational costs limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank approximation is an effective method for computer vision and natural language processing models, but its application in compressing CTR prediction models has been less explored. Due to the limited memory and computing resources, compression of CTR prediction models often confronts three fundamental challenges, i.e., (1). How to reduce the model sizes to adapt to edge devices? (2). How to speed up CTR prediction model inference? (3). How to retain the capabilities of original models after compression? Previous low-rank compression research mostly uses tensor decomposition, which can achieve a high parameter compression ratio, but brings in AUC degradation and additional computing overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a unified low-rank decomposition framework for compressing CTR prediction models. We find that even with the most classic matrix decomposition SVD method, our framework can achieve better performance than the original model. To further improve the effectiveness of our framework, we locally compress the output features instead of compressing the model weights. Our unified low-rank compression framework can be applied to embedding tables and MLP layers in various CTR prediction models. Extensive experiments on two academic datasets and one real industrial benchmark demonstrate that, with 3-5x model size reduction, our compressed models can achieve both faster inference and higher AUC than the uncompressed original models.

      <title>A Vlogger-augmented Graph Neural Network Model for Micro-video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing micro-video recommendation models exploit the interactions between users and micro-videos and/or multi-modal information of micro-videos to predict the next micro-video a user will watch, ignoring the information related to vloggers, i.e., the producers of micro-videos. However, in micro-video scenarios, vloggers play a significant role in user-video interactions, since vloggers generally focus on specific topics and users tend to follow the vloggers they are interested in. Therefore, in the paper, we propose a vlogger-augmented graph neural network model VA-GNN, which takes the effect of vloggers into consideration. Specifically, we construct a tripartite graph with users, micro-videos, and vloggers as nodes, capturing user preferences from different views, i.e., the video-view and the vlogger-view. Moreover, we conduct cross-view contrastive learning to keep the consistency between node embeddings from the two different views. Besides, when predicting the next user-video interaction, we adaptively combine the user preferences for a video itself and its vlogger. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VA-GNN outperforms multiple existing GNN-based recommendation models.</description>

      <title>Can We Trust Recommender System Fairness Evaluation? The Role of Fairness and Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance and fairness are two major objectives of recommender systems (RSs). Recent work proposes measures of RS fairness that are either independent from relevance (fairness-only) or conditioned on relevance (joint measures). While fairness-only measures have been studied extensively, we look into whether joint measures can be trusted. We collect all joint evaluation measures of RS relevance and fairness, and ask: How much do they agree with each other? To what extent do they agree with relevance/fairness measures? How sensitive are they to changes in rank position, or to increasingly fair and relevant recommendations? We empirically study for the first time the behaviour of these measures across 4 real-world datasets and 4 recommenders. We find that most of these measures: i) correlate weakly with one another and even contradict each other at times; ii) are less sensitive to rank position changes than relevance- and fairness-only measures, meaning that they are less granular than traditional RS measures; and iii) tend to compress scores at the low end of their range, meaning that they are not very expressive. We counter the above limitations with a set of guidelines on the appropriate usage of such measures, i.e., they should be used with caution due to their tendency to contradict each other and of having a very small empirical range.</description>

Abstract: This report evaluates the efficiency of Graph Edit Distance (GED) computation for graph similarity search, comparing Cascading Metric Trees (CMT) with brute-force verification. Despite the anticipated advantages of CMT, our findings indicate it does not consistently outperform brute-force methods in speed. The study, based on graph data from PubChem, suggests that the computational complexity of GED-based GSS remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>Video Enriched Retrieval Augmented Generation Using Aligned Video Captions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of "aligned visual captions" as a mechanism for integrating information contained within videos into retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based chat assistant systems. These captions are able to describe the visual and audio content of videos in a large corpus while having the advantage of being in a textual format that is both easy to reason about &amp; incorporate into large language model (LLM) prompts, but also typically require less multimedia content to be inserted into the multimodal LLM context window, where typical configurations can aggressively fill up the context window by sampling video frames from the source video. Furthermore, visual captions can be adapted to specific use cases by prompting the original foundational model / captioner for particular visual details or fine tuning. In hopes of helping advancing progress in this area, we curate a dataset and describe automatic evaluation procedures on common RAG tasks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing. Code and data are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowledgeCircuits.</description>

      <title>Ranking with Ties based on Noisy Performance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking a set of objects based on their performance when the measurement of said performance is subject to noise. In this scenario, the performance is measured repeatedly, resulting in a range of measurements for each object. If the ranges of two objects do not overlap, then we consider one object as 'better' than the other, and we expect it to receive a higher rank; if, however, the ranges overlap, then the objects are incomparable, and we wish them to be assigned the same rank. Unfortunately, the incomparability relation of ranges is in general not transitive; as a consequence, in general the two requirements cannot be satisfied simultaneously, i.e., it is not possible to guarantee both distinct ranks for objects with separated ranges, and same rank for objects with overlapping ranges. This conflict leads to more than one reasonable way to rank a set of objects. In this paper, we explore the ambiguities that arise when ranking with ties, and define a set of reasonable rankings, which we call partial rankings. We develop and analyse three different methodologies to compute a partial ranking. Finally, we show how performance differences among objects can be investigated with the help of partial ranking.</description>

      <title>ReFIT: Relevance Feedback from a Reranker during Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieve-and-rerank is a prevalent framework in neural information retrieval, wherein a bi-encoder network initially retrieves a pre-defined number of candidates (e.g., K=100), which are then reranked by a more powerful cross-encoder model. While the reranker often yields improved candidate scores compared to the retriever, its scope is confined to only the top K retrieved candidates. As a result, the reranker cannot improve retrieval performance in terms of Recall@K. In this work, we propose to leverage the reranker to improve recall by making it provide relevance feedback to the retriever at inference time. Specifically, given a test instance during inference, we distill the reranker's predictions for that instance into the retriever's query representation using a lightweight update mechanism. The aim of the distillation loss is to align the retriever's candidate scores more closely with those produced by the reranker. The algorithm then proceeds by executing a second retrieval step using the updated query vector. We empirically demonstrate that this method, applicable to various retrieve-and-rerank frameworks, substantially enhances retrieval recall across multiple domains, languages, and modalities.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the Evolution of Behavioural Embeddings in Social Media Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging short-video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and ShareChat present unique challenges for recommender systems, primarily originating from a continuous stream of new content. ShareChat alone receives approximately 2 million pieces of fresh content daily, complicating efforts to assess quality, learn effective latent representations, and accurately match content with the appropriate user base, especially given limited user feedback. Embedding-based approaches are a popular choice for industrial recommender systems because they can learn low-dimensional representations of items, leading to effective recommendation that can easily scale to millions of items and users.
  Our work characterizes the evolution of such embeddings in short-video recommendation systems, comparing the effect of batch and real-time updates to content embeddings. We investigate \emph{how} embeddings change with subsequent updates, explore the relationship between embeddings and popularity bias, and highlight their impact on user engagement metrics. Our study unveils the contrast in the number of interactions needed to achieve mature embeddings in a batch learning setup versus a real-time one, identifies the point of highest information updates, and explores the distribution of $\ell_2$-norms across the two competing learning modes. Utilizing a production system deployed on a large-scale short-video app with over 180 million users, our findings offer insights into designing effective recommendation systems and enhancing user satisfaction and engagement in short-video applications.</description>

      <title>History-Aware Conversational Dense Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational search facilitates complex information retrieval by enabling multi-turn interactions between users and the system. Supporting such interactions requires a comprehensive understanding of the conversational inputs to formulate a good search query based on historical information. In particular, the search query should include the relevant information from the previous conversation turns. However, current approaches for conversational dense retrieval primarily rely on fine-tuning a pre-trained ad-hoc retriever using the whole conversational search session, which can be lengthy and noisy. Moreover, existing approaches are limited by the amount of manual supervision signals in the existing datasets. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a History-Aware Conversational Dense Retrieval (HAConvDR) system, which incorporates two ideas: context-denoised query reformulation and automatic mining of supervision signals based on the actual impact of historical turns. Experiments on two public conversational search datasets demonstrate the improved history modeling capability of HAConvDR, in particular for long conversations with topic shifts.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) have become an essential tool for mitigating information overload in a range of real-world applications. Recent trends in RSs have revealed a major paradigm shift, moving the spotlight from model-centric innovations to data-centric efforts (e.g., improving data quality and quantity). This evolution has given rise to the concept of data-centric recommender systems (Data-Centric RSs), marking a significant development in the field. This survey provides the first systematic overview of Data-Centric RSs, covering 1) the foundational concepts of recommendation data and Data-Centric RSs; 2) three primary issues of recommendation data; 3) recent research developed to address these issues; and 4) several potential future directions of Data-Centric RSs.</description>

Abstract: LLM-based agents have gained considerable attention for their decision-making skills and ability to handle complex tasks. Recognizing the current gap in leveraging agent capabilities for multi-agent collaboration in recommendation systems, we introduce MACRec, a novel framework designed to enhance recommendation systems through multi-agent collaboration. Unlike existing work on using agents for user/item simulation, we aim to deploy multi-agents to tackle recommendation tasks directly. In our framework, recommendation tasks are addressed through the collaborative efforts of various specialized agents, including Manager, User/Item Analyst, Reflector, Searcher, and Task Interpreter, with different working flows. Furthermore, we provide application examples of how developers can easily use MACRec on various recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, conversational recommendation, and explanation generation of recommendation results. The framework and demonstration video are publicly available at https://github.com/wzf2000/MACRec.</description>

      <title>Double Correction Framework for Denoising Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As its availability and generality in online services, implicit feedback is more commonly used in recommender systems. However, implicit feedback usually presents noisy samples in real-world recommendation scenarios (such as misclicks or non-preferential behaviors), which will affect precise user preference learning. To overcome the noisy samples problem, a popular solution is based on dropping noisy samples in the model training phase, which follows the observation that noisy samples have higher training losses than clean samples. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that this solution still has limits. (1) High training losses can result from model optimization instability or hard samples, not just noisy samples. (2) Completely dropping of noisy samples will aggravate the data sparsity, which lacks full data exploitation. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a Double Correction Framework for Denoising Recommendation (DCF), which contains two correction components from views of more precise sample dropping and avoiding more sparse data. In the sample dropping correction component, we use the loss value of the samples over time to determine whether it is noise or not, increasing dropping stability. Instead of averaging directly, we use the damping function to reduce the bias effect of outliers. Furthermore, due to the higher variance exhibited by hard samples, we derive a lower bound for the loss through concentration inequality to identify and reuse hard samples. In progressive label correction, we iteratively re-label highly deterministic noisy samples and retrain them to further improve performance. Finally, extensive experimental results on three datasets and four backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>CausalCite: A Causal Formulation of Paper Citations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citation count of a paper is a commonly used proxy for evaluating the significance of a paper in the scientific community. Yet citation measures are widely criticized for failing to accurately reflect the true impact of a paper. Thus, we propose CausalCite, a new way to measure the significance of a paper by assessing the causal impact of the paper on its follow-up papers. CausalCite is based on a novel causal inference method, TextMatch, which adapts the traditional matching framework to high-dimensional text embeddings. TextMatch encodes each paper using text embeddings from large language models (LLMs), extracts similar samples by cosine similarity, and synthesizes a counterfactual sample as the weighted average of similar papers according to their similarity values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CausalCite on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, (test-of-time) awards for past papers, and its stability across various subfields of AI. We also provide a set of findings that can serve as suggested ways for future researchers to use our metric for a better understanding of the quality of a paper. Our code is available at https://github.com/causalNLP/causal-cite.</description>

      <title>INTERS: Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models in Search with Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS.</description>

      <title>Generation of Asset Administration Shell with Large Language Model Agents: Towards Semantic Interoperability in Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach for achieving semantic interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry 4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we study semi-supervised graph classification, which aims at accurately predicting the categories of graphs in scenarios with limited labeled graphs and abundant unlabeled graphs. Despite the promising capability of graph neural networks (GNNs), they typically require a large number of costly labeled graphs, while a wealth of unlabeled graphs fail to be effectively utilized. Moreover, GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local neighborhood information using message-passing mechanisms, thus lacking the ability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named HEAL for semi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from the perspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically, to better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a hypergraph structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies beyond pairwise relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we introduce a line graph to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby better mining the underlying semantic structures. Finally, we develop a relational consistency learning to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two branches and provide better mutual guidance. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>
