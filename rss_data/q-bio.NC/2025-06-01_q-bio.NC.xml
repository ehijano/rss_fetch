      <title>On the Parallels Between Evolutionary Theory and the State of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article critically examines the foundational principles of contemporary AI methods, exploring the limitations that hinder its potential. We draw parallels between the modern AI landscape and the 20th-century Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology, and highlight how advancements in evolutionary theory that augmented the Modern Synthesis, particularly those of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, offer insights that can inform a new design paradigm for AI. By synthesizing findings across AI and evolutionary theory, we propose a pathway to overcome existing limitations, enabling AI to achieve its aspirational goals.</description>

      <title>Convergent transcriptomic and neuroimaging signature of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multi-factorial neurodevelopmental disorder, whose causes are still poorly understood. Effective therapies to reduce all the heterogeneous symptoms of the disorder do not exists yet, but behavioural programs started at a very young age may improve the quality of life of the patients. For this reason, many efforts have been dedicated to the research of a reliable biomarker for early diagnosis. Machine learning approaches to distinguish ASDs from healthy controls based on their brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) have been plagued by the problem of confounders, showing poor classification performance and inconsistency in the biomarker definition. Brain transcriptomics studies, instead, showed some converging results, but being based on data that can be acquired only post-mortem they are not useful for diagnosis. In this work, using an imaging transcriptomics approach, the following results have been obtained.
  1) A deep learning based classifier resilient to confounders and able to exploit the temporal dimension of resting state functional MRIs has been developed, reaching an AUC of 0.89 on an independent test set.
  2) Five gene network modules involved in ASD have been identified, by analyzing brain transcriptomics data of subjects with ASD and healthy controls.
  3) By comparing the brain regions relevant for the classifier obtained in the first step and the brain-wide gene expression profiles of the modules of interest obtained in the second step, it has been proved that the regions that characterize ASD brain at the neuroimaging level are those in which four out of the five gene modules take a significantly high absolute value of expression.
  These results prove that, despite the heterogeneity of the disorder, it is possible to identify a neuroimaging-based biomarker of ASD, confirmed by transcriptomics.</description>

      <title>Weak but influential: Nonlinear contributions of structural connectivity to human cognitive abilities and brain functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse human cognitive abilities are rooted in brain structural connectivity which has weights spanning several orders of magnitude. However, due to false-positive challenges in tractography, weak connectivity has been often treated as noise and ignored - despite its prevalence across mammalian brains. Here we show that weak connectivity significantly predicts human cognitive abilities and supports brain functions through amplification of its small weight in a nonlinear manner. Using the Human Connectome Project dataset (n=999) and multiple tractography algorithms, we constructed the whole-brain structural connectivity with heterogeneous weights of streamline numbers. We found that weak connectivity involves high individual variability and significantly predicts general cognitive ability and memory in individuals, and it is also critical for whole-brain dynamic simulation and structure-function coupling. Importantly, fusing two post-tractography filtering methods of streamlines potentially results in more reliable connectivity that preserves weak links and outperforms conventional thresholding in predicting cognitive abilities and functional connectivity. At the network level, weak connectivity expands the operational capacity of brain networks to enhance both global integration and fine-grained segregation, thereby supporting a functional balance essential for cognitive abilities. Finally, we identified a specific type of weak connectivity mainly linking visual/motor to limbic areas with negative gene co-expression, which has a disproportionately large impact on cognitive predictions and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards model-based design of causal manipulations of brain circuits with high spatiotemporal precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neurotechnology enable precise spatiotemporal patterns of microstimulations with single-cell resolution. The choice of perturbation sites must satisfy two key criteria: efficacy in evoking significant responses and selectivity for the desired target effects. This choice is currently based on laborious trial-and-error procedures, unfeasible for sequences of multi-site stimulations. Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are urgently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity. Second, we provide an efficient method to design multi-site stimulation patterns by combining approaches from nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory and data-driven methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using multi-site stimulation patterns in recurrent network models.</description>

      <title>Representational Difference Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.</description>

      <title>Surface waves and axoplasmic pressure waves in action potential propagation: fundamentally different physics or two sides of the same coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev.
  Note. We, the authors, contacted A. El Hady and B. Machta for comment on the ideas presented herein. They suggested that we "submit a Matters Arising Letter to Nature Communications and we will be asked to respond in due time." Nature Communications ultimately rejected the manuscript, citing:
  "... Our main criterion for consideration of Matters Arising is the degree to which the piece provides interesting and timely scientific criticism and clarification of a Nature Communications publication. In the present case, while we appreciate the interest of your comments to the community, we do not feel that they advance or clarify understanding of the article in question to the extent required for publication in Nature Communications."
  We are posting the submitted version online in accordance with the journal's submission guidelines, which state:
  "Authors who have had a submission declined are encouraged to post it as an online comment to the paper concerned at the journal's website and/or on an appropriate preprint server."</description>

      <title>Finite-time scaling on low-dimensional map bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the concept of finite-time scaling to characterize bifurcation diagrams at finite times in deterministic discrete dynamical systems, drawing an analogy with finite-size scaling used to study critical behavior in finite systems. In this work, we extend the finite-time scaling approach in several key directions. First, we present numerical results for 1D maps exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations and discontinuous transitions, analyzing selected paradigmatic examples. We then define two observables, the finite-time susceptibility and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, that also display consistent scaling near bifurcation points. The method is further generalized to special cases of 2D maps including the 2D Chialvo map, capturing its bifurcation between a fixed point and a periodic orbit, while accounting for discontinuities and asymmetric periodic orbits. These results underscore fundamental connections between temporal and spatial observables in complex systems, suggesting new avenues for studying complex dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Representation Learning of Neuronal Dynamics and Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how neuronal networks reorganize in response to external stimuli and give rise to behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods often fail to capture the evolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship to behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings with sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel framework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating probabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns latent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable population-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked to behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We validate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a freely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a reaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting with a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships between adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural networks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and generalizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and synthetic biological systems. Its architecture is modality-agnostic and scalable, making it applicable across a wide range of neural recording platforms and behavioral paradigms.</description>

      <title>On The Causal Network Of Face-selective Regions In Human Brain During Movie Watching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the causal interactions in some brain tasks, such as face processing, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA)- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using fMRI data of natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Specifically, our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli, causally affects the number of identified connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing it's importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($&lt;\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|&gt;|\beta_{hi}|$).
  Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.</description>
