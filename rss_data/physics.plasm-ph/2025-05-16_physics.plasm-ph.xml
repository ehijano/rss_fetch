      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multi-Species Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Orbit-averaging and deposition accuracy for runaway electron beams in hybrid kinetic-MHD simulations of the runaway plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new procedure that combines the Kinetic Orbit Runaway electrons Code (KORC) and the NIMROD extended-MHD code to simulate runaway electrons (REs) in the post-disruption plateau. KORC integrates guiding-center orbits using a barycentric-based binary search strategy to generate initial guesses for the Newton-Raphson logical-to-physical coordinate inversion, guaranteeing reliable particle-to-mesh mapping in NIMROD, whose fields remain static for the present study. Samples are drawn in accord with experimental parallel current profiles of RE beams during the plateau phase. Deposition in NIMROD is verified through comparison with a Python-based finite element code that ensures periodicity in the poloidal direction and continuity at the magnetic axis. Accurate representation of near-axis fields requires finer mesh resolution to prevent under- and overshoots in current density from orbit inaccuracies. Yet, at a fixed particle count, increasing mesh resolution amplifies statistical noise in the deposited fields. An orbit-averaging method accumulates partial current deposits over multiple kinetic steps and reduces the statistical noise with little added computational cost. By coupling kinetic routines from KORC directly into the NIMROD codebase, these developments lay essential groundwork for future self-consistent KORC-NIMROD coupling.</description>

      <title>Resonant theory of kinetic ballooning modes in general toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear theory of the kinetic-ballooning-mode (KBM) instability is extended to capture a weakly-driven regime in general toroidal geometry where the destabilization is caused by the magnetic-drift resonance of the ions. Such resonantly-destabilized KBMs are characterized by broad eigenfunctions along the magnetic field line and near-marginal positive growth rates, even well below the beta threshold of their non-resonant counterparts. This unconventional (or sub-threshold) KBM, when destabilized, has been shown to catalyze an enhancement of turbulent transport in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator [1, 2]. Simplifying the energy dependence of key resonant quantities allows for an analytical treatment of this KBM using the physics-based ordering from the more general equations of Tang, Connor, and Hastie [3]. Results are then compared with high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations for the (st)KBM in W7-X and the conventional KBM in a circular tokamak at both high and low magnetic shear, where good agreement is obtained in all cases. This reduced KBM model provides deeper insight into (sub-threshold) KBMs and their relationship with geometry, and shows promise for aiding in transport model development and geometry-based turbulence optimization efforts going forward.</description>

      <title>Verification of a hybrid gyrokinetic model using the advanced semi-Lagrange code ssV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super simple Vlasov (ssV) code was developed to study instabilities, turbulence, and reconnection in weakly magnetized plasmas, such as the solar wind in the dissipation range and the edge of fusion plasmas. The ssV code overcomes the limitations of standard gyrokinetic theory by using a hybrid model that incorporates fully kinetic ions and gyrokinetic electrons. This hybrid gyrokinetic model enables accurate modeling in regimes characterized by steep gradients and high-frequency dynamics. To achieve this, ssV implements a set of semi-Lagrangian numerical schemes, including Positive Flux Conservative (PFC), Flux Conservative fifth-order (FCV), FCV with Umeda limiters, and a Semi-Lagrangian Monotonicity-Preserving fifth-order scheme (SLMP5). Benchmark problems such as Landau damping, ion-acoustic waves, ion Bernstein waves, and kinetic Alfven waves were employed to evaluate the schemes. The SLMP5 scheme consistently delivered the best overall accuracy and numerical stability performance. The code also addresses well-known electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulation issues, such as the Ampere cancellation problem, using carefully chosen velocity-space resolutions and accurate integral evaluation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing atomic oxygen product evolution in Micro Cavity Plasma Arrays by a combination of a Multi-PMT OES Setup and a 0-D Chemical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are widely used in applications such as ozone generation and volatile organic compound treatment, where performance can be enhanced through catalyst integration. A fundamental understanding of reactive species generation is essential for advancing these technologies. However, temporally resolving reactive species production, especially during the initial discharges, remains a challenge, despite its importance for controlling production rates and energy efficiency. This study examines atomic oxygen production as a model system for reactive species production in a micro-cavity plasma array, a custom surface DBD confined to micrometer-sized cavities. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed to investigate plasma-chemical processes in helium with 0.1-0.25$\%$ molecular oxygen admixture at atmospheric pressure. The discharge, powered by a 15$\,$kHz, 600$\,$V amplitude triangular voltage, achieved near-complete oxygen dissociation (up to 100$\%$), as determined via helium state-enhanced actinometry (SEA). A novel multi-photomultiplier system enabled precise temporal tracking of atomic oxygen density and dissociation dynamics. To ensure measurement accuracy, a basic 0D chemical model was developed, reinforcing the reliability of the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of reactive oxygen species produced by the COST microplasma jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is focused on measuring the densities of the excited molecular oxygen species, O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ and O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$, produced in a COST atmospheric pressure plasma jet using a helium-oxygen mixture. Knowledge of the ozone density is critical for measurements because of its high quenching rate of these species. Additionally O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ is difficult to measure, due to its low emission intensity and sensitivity to background interference in the plasma region. Therefore a flow cell was used to enhance signal detection in the effluent region. To validate the measurements and improve understanding of reaction mechanisms, results were compared with two simulation models: a pseudo-1D plug flow simulation and a 2D fluid simulation. The plug flow simulation provided an effective means for estimating species densities, with a fast computation time. The 2D simulation offered a more realistic description of the flow dynamics, which proved critical to correctly describe the experimental trends. However, it requires long computation times to reach an equilibrium state in the flow cell. Otherwise, it leads to discrepancies to the experimental data. Further discrepancies arose, from an overestimation of the ozone density from the models, as validated from the O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$ density measurements. Optimizing the reaction rate coefficients for the effluent region might improve the agreement with the experimental results. Despite these limitations both simulations aligned reasonably well with experimental data, showcasing the well validated plasma chemistry of the models, even for complicated effluent geometries.</description>

      <title>Comparison of high-order moment models for the ion dynamics in a bounded low-temperature plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasmas often present non-equilibrium ion distribution functions due to the collisions with the background gas and the presence of strong electric fields. This non-equilibrium is beyond classical fluid models, often requiring computationally-intensive kinetic simulations. In our work, we study high-order moment models in order to capture the non-equilibrium state with a macroscopic set of equations, which is more computationally efficient than kinetic simulations. We compare numerical simulations of different moment closures: Grad's closure, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM), the extended quadrature method of moments, and a method based on entropy maximization. We assess the different closures for plasma applications and propose efficient numerical discretizations. The numerical solution of the high-order moment models is compared to kinetic simulations of an argon plasma between two floating walls at different pressure regimes, from nearly collisionless to collisionally-dominated. In general, all the high-order moment closures capture the ion transport with high fidelity as compared to the kinetic simulations, providing an improvement as compared to classical fluid models. Classical fluid closures such as the Fourier law for the heat flux is shown to be not suitable to capture the sheath or the low pressure regime. In addition, the ability of each moment method to reconstruct the velocity distribution function from the moments is assessed. The high-order moment models are able to capture the non-equilibrium distributions in the bulk and sheath with remarkable fidelity, dramatically improving classical fluid models while having comparable computational cost. In particular, the HyQMOM shows to be a robust method that provides an excellent comparison with the kinetic simulations of both the moments and the distribution function in the bulk and the sheath.</description>

      <title>Impulse-driven transport of liquid metal from z-pinch electrodes and implications for fusion fuel contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Liquid Electrode eXperiment is a surrogate environment to study the dynamic behavior of liquid metal plasma facing components relevant to a z-pinch device. Current pulses with amplitudes between 50 and 200 kA produce magnetic fields up to 30 T at the surface of a wire 1.5 to 2.5 mm in radius, mounted with one end submerged in a pool of liquid metal. The resulting forces generate a fast-moving annular jet surrounding the wire, preceded in some cases by small ejected droplets of varying sizes. High-speed videography records the motion of the liquid metal free surface upon exposure to magnetic pressures between 0.5 and 10 MPa. The vertical velocity of the resulting jets ranged from 0.6 to 5.3 m/s with consistent radial expansion. The velocities of the ejecta ranged from -3.1 to +18.9 m/s in the vertical direction and from -14.3 to +6.3 m/s in the radial direction. We investigate the likelihood and severity of z-pinch core contamination for repetitively-pulsed plasmas in the context of the observed droplets for liquid metal plasma facing component candidate materials: lithium, gallium, silver, tin, lead, FLiBe, and FLiNaK.</description>

      <title>PyLIT: Reformulation and implementation of the analytic continuation problem using kernel representation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations are a cornerstone for studying quantum many-body systems. The analytic continuation (AC) needed to estimate dynamic quantities from these simulations is an inverse Laplace transform, which is ill-conditioned. If this inversion were surmounted, then dynamical observables (e.g. dynamic structure factor (DSF) $S(q,\omega)$) could be extracted from the imaginary-time correlation functions estimates.
  Although of important, the AC problem remains challenging due to its ill-posedness. To address this challenge, we express the DSF as a linear combination of kernel functions with known Laplace transforms that have been tailored to satisfy its physical constraints. We use least-squares optimization regularized with a Bayesian prior to determine the coefficients of this linear combination. We explore various regularization term, such as the commonly used entropic regularizer, as well as the Wasserstein distance and $L^2$-distance as well as techniques for setting the regularization weight. A key outcome is the open-source package PyLIT (\textbf{Py}thon \textbf{L}aplace \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{T}ransform), which leverages Numba and unifies the presented formulations. PyLIT's core functionality is kernel construction and optimization.
  In our applications, we find PyLIT's DSF estimates share qualitative features with other more established methods. We identify three key findings. Firstly, independent of the regularization choice, utilizing non-uniform grid point distributions reduced the number of unknowns and thus reduced our space of possible solutions. Secondly, the Wasserstein distance, a previously unexplored regularizer, performs as good as the entropic regularizer while benefiting from its linear gradient. Thirdly, future work can meaningfully combine regularized and stochastic optimization.

      <title>Generation of magnetic fields around black hole accretion discs due to non conservative radiation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of magnetic fields above black hole accretion discs due to the non-zero curl of the disc radiation field. By self consistently computing the components of the radiation flux and their curl, we show that the rotational nature of the radiation field induces charge separation, leading to magnetic field generation in the plasma above the disc. Solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations, we derive the time evolution of these fields and demonstrate that they grow over astrophysically relevant timescales. For a standard Keplerian accretion disc, the produced magnetic fields remain weak, on the order of a few Gauss, consistent with previous predictions. However, when a luminous corona is present in the inner disc region ($r_d &lt; 3-10 r_g$), the generated fields reach dynamically significant strengths of up to $10^5$ Gauss where the magnetic energy density approaching few percentage of equipartition with the gas pressure. These fields develop within realistic growth timescales (such as viscous timescale) and can be dynamically significant in governing disc and jet evolution. Our findings suggest that radiation-driven magnetic fields play a crucial role in accretion flow magnetization, influencing both disc dynamics and observational signatures. The predicted field strengths could affect the thermal emission, synchrotron radiation, and polarization properties of black hole accretion systems, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGN, and jet formation. Future numerical simulations and high-resolution polarimetric observations, such as those from IXPE, eXTP, and EHT, may provide observational confirmation of our findings.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional tearing instability of flux-tube-like magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process, is pivotal in understanding energy conversion and particle acceleration in astrophysical systems. While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the dynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain under-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability to 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D equilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We perform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and direct numerical simulations to investigate the effects of three-dimensionality. Remarkably, we find that a tearing-like instability arises in 3D as well, even without the presence of guide fields. Further, our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability exhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\int g(y)^{1/2} dy~/\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling characteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying resistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics.</description>
