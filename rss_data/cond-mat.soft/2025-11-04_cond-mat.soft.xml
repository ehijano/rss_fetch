      <title>Emergent clusters in strongly confined systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed digital twins of brainbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brainbot is a robotic device powered by a battery-driven motor that induces horizontal vibrations which lead to controlled two-dimensional motion. While the physical design and capabilities of a brainbot have been discussed in previous work, here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of its motion. We show that the various autonomous trajectories executed by a brainbot -- linear, spinning, orbital and helical -- are explained by a kinematic model that ascribes angular and translational velocities to the brainbot's body. This model also uncovers some trajectories that have not so far been observed experimentally. Using this kinematic framework, we present a simulation system that accurately reproduces the experimental trajectories. This can be used to parameterize a digital twin of a brainbot that executes synthetic trajectories that faithfully mimic the required statistical features of the experimental trajectories while being as long as required, such as for machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation Dynamics and Active Turbulence in a Binary Fluid Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter, encompassing natural systems, converts surrounding energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non-equilibrium behaviors such as active turbulence and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this study, we present a novel two-fluids model considering dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model for phase separation with Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics equation for orientational order and two distinct momentum equations for active and passive fluids coupled by viscous drag. A phase field-based lattice Boltzmann method is used to investigate the existence of active turbulence and phase separation in the binary mixture. We analyze micro-phase separated domain under extensile and contractile stresses, long the statistical properties of turbulent flow. Key parameters, like active parameter, tumbling parameter and elastic constant, affect the characteristic scale of flow. Our findings show that the interaction of active stress and two-fluid hydrodynamics leads to complex non-equilibrium pattern formation. This offers insights into biological and synthetic active materials.</description>

      <title>Controlling Vortex Rotation in Dry Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rotation of a vortex around a circular obstacle in dry active matter in the presence of M half-circles distributed around the obstacle. To quantify this effect, we define the parameter {\Pi}M , which is the ratio between the mean angular velocity of the controlled vortex and the root-mean-square angular velocity of the isolated vortex. We identify two rotational regimes determined by the obstacle configuration. In the first regime, where {\Pi}M &lt; 0 corresponding to the flat side of the half-circles facing the vortex, the rotation is clockwise. In the second regime ({\Pi}M &gt; 0), it corresponding to the curved sides facing the vortex, the rotation becomes counterclockwise. We further analyze the impact of this control on vortex stability, showing that the configuration of semi-circles can enhance or suppress stability depending on their geometry and distance from the central obstacle. Our results demonstrate a possible setup to control the spontaneous rotation of dry active matter around circular obstacles.</description>

      <title>Geomimicry: Emergent Dynamics in Earth-Mediated Complex Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soils and sediments are soft, amorphous materials with complex microstructures and mechanical properties, that are also building blocks for industrial materials such as concrete. These Earth-mediated materials evolve under prolonged environmental pressures like mechanical stress, chemical gradients, and biological activity. Here, we introduce geomimicry, a new paradigm for designing sustainable materials by learning from the emergent and adaptive dynamics of Earth-mediated matter. Drawing a parallel to biomimicry, we posit that these geomaterials follow evolutionary design rules, optimizing their structure and function in response to persistent natural forces. Our central argument is that by decoding these rules: primarily through understanding the emergence of novel exotic properties from multiscale interactions between heterogenous components, we can engineer a new class of adaptive, sustainable matter. We propose two complementary approaches here. The top-down approach looks to nature to identify building blocks and map them to functional groups defined by their mechanical (rather than chemical) behaviors, and then examine how environmental training tunes interactions among these groups. The bottom up approach seeks to leverage and test this framework, building earth materials one component at a time under prescribed fluctuating stresses that guide assembly of complex and out-of-equilibrium materials. The goal is to create materials with programmed functionalities, such as erosion resistance or self-healing capabilities. Geomimicry offers a pathway to truly design Earth-mediated circular materials, with potential applications ranging from climate-resilient soils and smart agriculture to new insights into planetary terraforming, fundamentally shifting the focus from static compositions to dynamic, evolving systems that are mediated via their environment.</description>

      <title>Detecting active L\'evy particles using differential dynamic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting L\'evy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting L\'evy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled L\'evy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active L\'evy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli exhibits no signature of L\'evy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active L\'evy particles.</description>

      <title>Competition between Glassy Five-Fold Structures and Locally Dense Packing Structures Governs Two-Stage Compaction of Granular Hexapods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using X-ray tomography, we experimentally investigate the structural evolution of packings composed of 3D-printed hexapod particles, each formed by three mutually orthogonal spherocylinders, during tap-induced compaction. We identify two distinct structural compaction mechanisms: an initial stage dominated by enhanced particle interlocking, which yields local mechanically stable structures through strong geometric entanglement, and a later stage characterized by the formation of dense polytetrahedral aggregates and a sharp increase in the number of five-ring motifs. The emergence of these five-fold symmetric structures indicates that, despite their highly concave geometry, hexapod packings can be effectively treated as hard-sphere-like systems and exhibit similar glass-like disordered configurations. The frustration between local mechanically stable structures and global glassy order suggests a universal organizational principle underlying the structure of uniform and isotropic disordered granular materials.</description>

      <title>Rheological Behavior of Colloidal Silica Dispersion: Irreversible Aging and Thixotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the rheological behavior of colloidal dispersion of charge-screened nanoparticles of silica suspended in aqueous media that exhibits soft solid-like consistency. We observe that the system shows various characteristics of physical aging wherein it undergoes time evolution of rheological properties such as elastic modulus, relaxation time, and yield stress subsequent to shear melting of the same. Notably, the relaxation time increases more strongly than linearly with time, which is suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. When considered along with the time-dependent yield stress, this behavior indicates the steady state shear stress-shear rate flow curve to be non-monotonic with a negative slope in a lower shear rate region. Performing shear melting on this system at a later date since the preparation of the dispersion (rest time) results in higher viscosity as well as yield stress, and the corresponding evolution of the elastic modulus shifts to lower times. This implies that physical aging in studied silica dispersion, while reversible over short time scales (of the order of hours), becomes irreversible over longer durations (days) owing to the inability of strong shear to break interparticle bonds that have strengthened over long durations. We also develop a thixotropic structural kinetic model within a time-dependent Maxwell framework that captures the experimentally observed rheological behavior well.</description>

      <title>Building granular structures with elasto-active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural active systems routinely reshape and reorganize their environments through sustained local interactions. Examples of decentralized collective construction are common in nature, e.g., many insects achieve large-scale constructions through indirect communication. While synthetic realizations of self-organization exist, they typically rely on rigid agents that require some kind of sensors and direct programming to achieve their function. Understanding how soft, deformable active matter navigates and remodels crowded landscapes remains an open challenge. Here we show that connecting rigid microbots to elastic beams yields elasto-active structures that can restructure and adapt to heterogeneous surroundings. We investigate the dynamics of these agents in environments with varying granular densities, rationalizing how they can aggregate or carve the medium through gentle interactions. At low density, the system compacts dispersed obstacles into clusters, a process modeled by a modified Smoluchowski coagulation theory. At high density, our agents carve voids whose size is predicted by a force-limited argument. These results establish a framework for understanding how activity, elasticity, and deformability can influence active navigation and environmental reconfiguration in granular media.</description>

      <title>Capillary and priming pressures control the penetration of yield-stress fluids through non-wetting 2D meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forcing hydrophilic fluids through hydrophobic porous solids is a recurrent industrial challenge. If the penetrating fluid is Newtonian, the imposed pressure has to overcome the capillary pressure at the fluid-air interface in a pore. The presence of a yield-stress, however, makes the pressure transfer and the penetration significantly more complex. In this study, we experimentally investigate the forced penetration of a water based yield-stress fluid through a regular hydrophobic mesh under quasi-static conditions, combining quantitative pressure measurements and direct visualisation of the penetration process. We reveal that the penetration is controlled by a competition between the yield-stress and two distinct pressures. The capillary pressure, that dictates the threshold at which the yield-stress fluid penetrates the hydrophobic mesh, and a priming pressure, that controls how the fluid advances through it. The latter corresponds to a pressure drop ensuing a local capillary instability, never reported before. Our findings shine a new light on forced imbibition processes, with direct implications on their fundamental understanding and practical engineering.</description>

      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

Abstract: Many compliant shell mechanisms are periodically corrugated or creased. Being thin, their preferred deformation modes are inextensional, i.e., isometric. Here, we report on a recent characterization of the isometric deformations of periodic surfaces. In a way reminiscent of Gauss theorem, the result builds a constraint that relates the ways in which the periodic surface stretches, effectively but isometrically, to the ways in which it bends and twists. Several examples and use cases are presented.</description>

      <title>Confinement inhibits surficial attachment and induces collective behaviors in bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial colonies are a well-known example of living active matter, exhibiting collective behaviors such as nematic alignment and collective motion that play an important role in the spread of microbial infections. While the underlying mechanics of these behaviors have been described in model systems, many open questions remain about how microbial self-organization adapts to the variety of different environments bacteria encounter in natural and clinical settings. Here, using novel imaging and computational analysis techniques, the effects of confinement to 2D on the collective behaviors of pathogenic bacteria are described. Biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa are grown on different substrates, either open to the surrounding fluid or confined to a single monolayer between two surfaces. Orientational ordering in the colony, cell morphologies, and trajectories are measured using single-cell segmentation and tracking. Surprisingly, confinement inhibits permanent attachment and induces twitching motility, giving rise to multiple coexisting collective behaviors. This effect is shown to be independent of the confining material and the presence of liquid medium. The nematic alignment and degree of correlation in the cells' trajectories determines how effectively bacteria can invade the space between two surfaces and the 3D structure of the colony after several days. Confinement causes the formation of dynamic cell layers driven by collective motion as well as collective verticalization leading to the formation of densely packed crystalline structures exhibiting long-range order. These results demonstrate the remarkable breadth of collective behaviors exhibited by bacteria in different environments, which must be considered to better understand bacterial colonization of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bubble damping of non-stationary oscillatory flow stabilization in microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent instability of oscillatory flows presents a significant challenge in microfluidics, impairing performance in different applications from particle detachemnt to organs-on-a-chip. Trapped air inside a microfluidic system passively dampens these fluctuations because of the compressible nature of air. However, a foundational theoretical model that describes this effect has remained elusive. Here, a first-principles model that fully characterizes the effects of a trapped air volume in oscillatory microfluidic flow is derived. The model identifies a dimensionless product as the governing parameter, unifying the interplay between air compressibility and fluidic resistance. It precisely predicts the volume displacement dynamics of the liquid front, which compared with the original flow, it presents amplitude reduction, phase shift, and transient drift. The theoretical framework was validated with different experiments across a broad range of conditions. This work transforms trapped air from a source of unpredictability into a powerful, predictable element for tailoring oscillatory flow stability, providing a rigorous design tool for microfluidic systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in metamaterials and fabrication techniques have revived interest in mechanical computing. Contrary to techniques relying on static deformations of buckling beams or origami-based lattices, the integration of wave scattering and mechanical memory presents a promising path toward efficient, low-latency elastoacoustic computing. This work introduces a novel class of multifunctional mechanical computing circuits that leverage the rich dynamics of phononic and locally resonant materials. These circuits incorporate memory-integrated components, realized here via metamaterial cells infused with shape memory alloys which recall stored elastic profiles and trigger specific actions upon thermal activation. A critical advantage of this realization is its synergistic interaction with incident vibroacoustic loads and the inherited high speed of waves, giving it a notable performance edge over recent adaptations of mechanically intelligent systems that employ innately slower mechanisms such as elastomeric shape changes and snap-through bistabilities. Through a proof-of-concept physical implementation, the efficacy and reconfigurability of the wave-based gates are demonstrated via output probes and measured wavefields. Furthermore, the modular design of the fundamental gates can be used as building blocks to construct complex combinational logic circuits, paving the way for sequential logic in wave-based analog computing systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Undulatory Swimming with Constrained Deformation and Actuation Intervals</title>

Abstract: In nature, many unicellular organisms are able to swim with the help of beating filaments, where local energy input leads to cooperative undulatory beating motion. Here, we investigate by employing reinforcement learning how undulatory microswimmers modeled as a discretized bead-bend-spring filament actuated by torques which are constrained locally. We show that the competition between actively applied torques and intrinsic bending stiffness leads to various optimal beating patterns characterized by distinct frequencies, amplitudes, and wavelengths. Interestingly, the optimum solutions depend on the action interval, i.e.\ the time scale how fast the microswimmer can \rev{change the applied torques} based on its internal state. We show that optimized stiffness- and action-interval-dependent beating is realized by bang-bang solutions of the applied torques with distinct optimum time-periodicity and phase shift between consecutive joints, which we analyze in detail by a systematic study of possible bang-bang wave solution patterns of applied torques. Our work not only sheds light on how efficient beating patterns of biological microswimmers can emerge based on internal and local constraints, but also offers actuation policies for potential artificial elastic microswimmers.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Framework for In Silico Thrombus Generation and Photoacoustic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thrombus microstructure plays a critical role in determining the treatment success for thrombus-related diseases such as stroke and deep vein thrombosis. However, no in vivo diagnostic method can fully capture thrombus microstructure yet. Photoacoustic imaging is uniquely positioned to provide information on thrombi composition as it relays optical absorption information from diffuse photons at acoustic propagation depths. Computational modeling enables systematic exploration of microstructural effects on imaging signals, offering insights into developing improved in vivo diagnostic techniques. However, no photoacoustic simulation platform can model microstructural features within centimeter-scale phantoms at reasonable computational cost. Here, we present REFINE, a topology-driven framework for generating in silico thrombi replicating its key replicating their key microstructural traits. REFINE enables controlled, recursive optimization of thrombus topology, making it suitable for accurate photoacoustic modeling and potentially powerful for biomechanical analyses. These digital thrombi are embedded into a multiscale photoacoustic simulation platform that bridges microscale acoustic modeling with macroscale thrombus geometries, enabling efficient and realistic simulation of photoacoustic signal responses. We created unique thrombi microstructure for various compositions and porosities. Our simulation framework effectively links microstructural features to macroscale imaging outcomes, in agreement with previous empirical studies. Our results demonstrate that thrombus microstructure significantly affects photoacoustic spectral responses and can be modeled in silico. These findings highlight that multiscale photoacoustic simulation is a powerful tool for characterizing tissue microstructure and that our framework enables in silico thrombi analysis and diagnostic imaging strategy development</description>

      <title>Information bounds the robustness of self-organized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. In this Letter we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of self-organized nano-systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. This universal bound can be saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients. When long-range correlations are present, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies bio-mimetic principles for the self-assembly of synthetic nanosystems and rationalizes, on purely information-theoretic grounds, why scale separation and hierarchical structures are common motifs in biology.</description>

      <title>Active Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid</title>

Abstract: The study of active matter system has critical importance in revealing the physical essence of biological collective behavior. Dense bacterial suspension - a typical biological active matter, exhibits a wide range of phenomenons, among which bacterial turbulence has received extensive interest in recent years. This seemingly chaotic motion is widely studied in Newtonian fluid. However, studies based on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects, leaving the role of shear-thinning viscosity largely unexplored despite its prevalence in natural bacterial environments like mucus and gastric fluids. Here, we experimentally employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to study the impacts of various viscosities by Newtonian fluid and shear-thinning effects by Non-Newtonian fluids on bacterial turbulence. We analyzed various physical properties, including energy, enstrophy, etc., and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. While the ordered arrangement of polymer chains under shear flow leads to the microscopic anisotropic viscosity, the suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of polymer chains caused by strong inter bacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments at a lower bacterial concentration and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory.</description>

Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>From Heteropolymer Stiffness Distributions to Effective Homopolymers: A Conformational Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic copolymers and biopolymers, such as polypeptides and double-stranded DNA, often exhibit strong variations in bending stiffness along their contour, which can significantly impact conformational behavior at larger scales. To investigate these effects, we employ a discretized heterogeneous worm-like chain model, where the local persistence lengths are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. In the first part, we develop a theoretical model that maps such heterogeneous chains to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. For uncorrelated disorder, our model predicts that this effective stiffness is systematically smaller than the arithmetic mean of the local persistence lengths, indicating that flexible segments have a bigger influence on the overall chain stiffness than rigid segments. We validate our model predictions using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations, considering both ideal and self-avoiding chains in good solvent, and find excellent agreement in the regime, where the persistence lengths are on the order of a few bond lengths, consistent with typical values observed in polypeptides. In the second part, we performed simulations using various coarse-grained models of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), finding that the simulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and heterogeneous worm-like chains. However, the IDPs are systematically larger than ideal worm-like chains, yet slightly more compact when excluded volume interactions are considered. We attribute these differences to intramolecular interactions between non-bonded monomers, which our theoretical models do not account for.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</description>

      <title>When and How Ultrasound Enhances Nanoparticle Diffusion in Hydrogels: A Stick-and-Release Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory.
  Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction.
  Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a "stick-and-release" mechanism.
  These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions in uniformly charged channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the concentration of electrolyte solution varies along the channel the forces arise that drag the fluid toward the higher or lower concentration region inducing a flow termed diffusio-osmotic. This article investigates a flow that emerges in channels with constant density of surface charge {\sigma} and thin compared to their thickness electrostatic diffuse layers. An equation for the fluid flow rate Q is derived and used to describe analytically the flux of ions, and local potentials and concentrations. This equation, which allows to treat the diffusio-osmotic problems without tedious and time consuming computations, clarifies that the global flow rate is controlled only by the surface charge and concentration drop between the channel ends, and indicates that there always exist two different values of {\sigma} that correspond to a particular Q. Our theory provides a simple explanation of the directions of the fluid flow rate and ionic flux depending on the surface charge and diffusivity of ions, predicts a non-linear concentration distribution along the channel caused by convection, and relates it to the local potential changes by a compact formula. We also present and interpret the variations of the diffusio-osmotic velocity profiles and the apparent slip velocity along the channel and show that the latter is highly non-uniform and could even becomes alternating. The relevance of our results for diffusio-osmotic experiments and for some electrochemistry and membrane science issues is discussed briefly.</description>

Abstract: Within a model where micrometer-size soft colloidal particles are viewed as liquid drops, we theoretically study the contact interaction between them. We compute the exact deformation energy across a broad range of indentations and for various model parameters, and we show that it can be reproduced using truncated superball and spheropolyhedral variational shapes in the attractive and the repulsive regime, respectively. At large surface tensions representative of microgels, this energy is pairwise additive well beyond small indentations and can be approximated by a power-law dependence on indentation with an exponent around 2.</description>

Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>
