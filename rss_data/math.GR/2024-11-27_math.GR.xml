      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <title>Measure doubling in unimodular locally compact groups and quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a (possibly discrete) unimodular locally compact group $G$ with Haar measure $\mu_G$, and a compact $A\subseteq G$ of positive measure with $\mu_G(A^2)\leq K\mu_G(A)$. Let $H$ be a closed normal subgroup of G and $\pi: G \rightarrow G/H$ be the quotient map. With the further assumption that $A= A^{-1}$, we show $$\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^2 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A).$$ We also demonstrate that $K^2$ cannot be replaced by $(1-\epsilon)K^2$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.
  In the general case (without $A=A^{-1}$), we show $\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^3 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A)$, improving an earlier result by An, Jing, Zhang, and the third author. Moreover, we are able to extract a compact set $B\subseteq A$ with $\mu_G(B)&gt; \mu_G(A)/2$ such that $ \mu_{G/H}(\pi B^2) &lt; 2K \mu_{G/H}(\pi B)$.</description>

      <title>Chevalley groups over Laurent polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme without $SL_2$-factors. For any unital commutative ring $R$, we denote by $E(R)$ the standard elementary subgroup of $G(R)$, that is, the subgroup generated by the elementary root unipotent elements. We prove that the map $$ G(R[x_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,x_n^{\pm 1}])/E(R[x_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,x_n^{\pm 1}])\to G\bigl(R((x_1))\ldots((x_n))\bigr)/E\bigl(R((x_1))\ldots((x_n))\bigr) $$ is injective for any $n\ge 1$, if $R$ is either a Dedekind domain or a Noetherian ring that is geometrically regular over a Dedekind domain with perfect residue fields. For $n=1$ this map is also an isomorphism. As a consequence, we show that if $D$ is a PID such that $SL_2(D)=E_2(D)$ (e.g. $D=\mathbb{Z}$), then $G(D[x_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,x_n^{\pm 1}])=E(D[x_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,x_n^{\pm 1}])$. This extends earlier results for special linear and symplectic groups due to A. A. Suslin and V. I. Kopeiko.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically. The redefined fractional differential operator can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, - , -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimization of the action, considering the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density as $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha (\phi_{a}\left(x\right)))$, the function of the symmetric Fractional derivative of the field in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Spectrum of Super Graphs defined on Certain Non-abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $A$ on a group $G$ and an equivalence relation $B$ on $G$, the $B$ super$A$ graph, whose vertex set is $G$ and two vertices $g$, $h$ are adjacent if and only if there exist $g^{\prime} \in[g]$ and $h^{\prime} \in[h]$ such that $g^{\prime}$ and $h^{\prime}$ are adjacent in $A$. Recently, Dalal \emph{et al.} (Spectrum of super commuting graphs of some finite groups, \textit{Computational and Applied Mathematics}, 43(6):348, 2024) obtain the Laplacian spectrum of supercommuting graphs of certain non-abelian groups including the dihedral group and the generalized quaternion group. In this paper, we continue the study of Laplacian spectrum of certian $B$ super$A$ graphs. We obtain the Laplacian spectrum of conjugacy superenhanced power graphs of certain non-abelian groups, namely: dihedral group, generalized quaternion group and semidihedral group. Moreover to enhance the work of Dalal \emph{et al}, we obtain the Laplacian spectrum of conjugacy supercommuting graph of semidihedral group. We prove that graphs considered in this paper are $L$-integral.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for uniform generation of unlabeled trees (P\'olya trees), with an extension of Cayley's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P\'olya trees are rooted, unlabeled trees on $n$ vertices. This paper gives an efficient, new way to generate P\'olya trees. This allows comparing typical unlabeled and labeled tree statistics and comparing asymptotic theorems with `reality'.
  Along the way, we give a product formula for the number of rooted labeled trees preserved by a given automorphism; this refines Cayley's formula.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of the shifted plactic monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plactic monoid $\mathbf{P}$ of Lascoux and Sch\"{u}tzenberger (1981) plays an important role in proofs of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for computing multiplicities in the linear representation theory of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and the cohomology of Grassmannians. Commonly, $\mathbf{P}$ is defined as a quotient of a free monoid by relations derived from a careful analysis of Schensted's insertion algorithm and the jeu de taquin algorithm on semistandard Young tableaux. However, Lascoux and Sch\"{u}tzenberger also gave an intrinsic characterization of $\mathbf{P}$ via a universal property.
  Serrano's (2010) shifted plactic monoid $\mathbf{S}$ is an analogue of $\mathbf{P}$ that governs instead the projective representation theory of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and the cohomology of isotropic Grassmannians. We provide a universal property for $\mathbf{S}$, analogous to the Lascoux-Sch\"{u}tzenberger characterization of $\mathbf{P}$.</description>

      <title>Towards parameterizing the entanglement body of a qubit pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method allowing to increase a computational efficiency of evaluation of non-local characteristics of a pair of qubits is described. The method is based on the construction of coordinates on a generic section of 2-qubit's entanglement space $\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ represented as the direct product of an ordered 3-dimensional simplex and the double coset $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{SU(2)}{\backslash} {\mathrm{SU(4)}}/ \mathrm{T^3}\,.$ Within this framework, the subset $\mathcal{SE}_{2\times2} \subset\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ corresponding to the rank-4 separable 2-qubit states is described as a semialgebraic variety given by a system of 3rd and 4th order polynomial inequalities in eigenvalues of the density matrix, whereas the polynomials coefficients are trigonometric functions defined over a direct product of two regular octahedra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the following group constructions preserve the semilinearity of the solution sets for knapsack equations (equations of the form $g_1^{x_1} \cdots g_k^{x_k} = g$ in a group $G$, where the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ take values in the natural numbers): graph products, amalgamated free products with finite amalgamated subgroups, HNN-extensions with finite associated subgroups, and finite extensions. Moreover, we study the dependence of the so-called magnitude for the solution set of a knapsack equation (the magnitude is a complexity measure for semi-linear sets) with respect to the length of the knapsack equation (measured in number of generators). We investigate, how this dependence changes under the above group operations.</description>

      <title>The multiple holomorph of centerless groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The holomorph $\mathrm{Hol}(G)$ may be defined as the normalizer of the subgroup of either left or right translations in the group of all permutations of $G$. The multiple holomorph $\mathrm{NHol}(G)$ is in turn defined as the normalizer of the holomorph. Their quotient $T(G) = \mathrm{NHol}(G)/\mathrm{Hol}(G)$ has been computed for various families of groups $G$. In this paper, we consider the case when $G$ is centerless, and we show that $T(G)$ must have exponent at most $2$ unless $G$ satisfies some fairly strong conditions. As applications of our main theorem, we are able to show that $T(G)$ has order $2$ for all almost simple groups $G$, and that $T(G)$ has exponent at most $2$ for all centerless perfect or complete groups $G$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite, non-abelian group of the form $G = A N$, where $A \leq G$ is abelian, and $N \trianglelefteq G$ is cyclic. We prove that the commuting graph $\Gamma(G)$ of $G$ is either a connected graph of diameter at most four, or the disjoint union of $|G'| + 1$ complete graphs. These results apply to all finite metacyclic groups, and to groups of square-free order in particular.</description>

      <title>Finite presentability of twisted Brin-Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a group $G$ acting faithfully on a set $S$, we characterize precisely when the twisted Brin-Thompson group $SV_G$ is finitely presented. The answer is that $SV_G$ is finitely presented if and only if we have the following: $G$ is finitely presented, the action of $G$ on $S$ has finitely many orbits of two-element subsets of $S$, and the stabilizer in $G$ of any element of $S$ is finitely generated. Since twisted Brin-Thompson groups are simple, a consequence is that any subgroup of a group admitting an action as above satisfies the Boone-Higman conjecture. In the course of proving this, we also establish a sufficient condition for a group acting cocompactly on a simply connected complex to be finitely presented, even if certain edge stabilizers are not finitely generated, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Allcock constructed a 13-dimensional complex ball quotient of which he conjectured that it admits a natural covering with covering group isomorphic to the Bimonster. This ball quotient contains the moduli space of cubic threefolds as an open dense subset of a 10-dimensional complex subball quotient. We prove that this subball quotient has a neighborhood in the Allcock ball quotient over which the conjectured cover exists.</description>

      <title>Resolute and symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on the one-to-one two-sided matching model with two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, where each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set modeled by a linear order. A matching mechanism associates a set of matchings to each preference profile; resoluteness, that is the capability to select a unique matching, and stability are important properties for a matching mechanism. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are resolute and stable matching mechanisms but they are unfair since they strongly favor one side of the market. We introduce a property for matching mechanisms that relates to fairness; such property, called symmetry, captures different levels of fairness and generalizes existing notions. We provide several possibility and impossibility results mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness, resoluteness, stability, weak Pareto optimality and minimal optimality. In particular, we prove that: resolute, gender fair matching mechanisms exist if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, gender fair, minimally optimal matching mechanism. Those results are obtained by employing algebraic methods based on group theory, an approach not yet explored in matching theory.</description>
