      <title>Generalized failure law for landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic failures have momentous impact in many scientific and technological fields but remain challenging to understand and predict. One key difficulty lies in the burstiness of rupture phenomena, which typically involve a series of progressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden bursts, rather than a smooth continuous progression. This seemingly erratic pattern challenges the conventional power law assumption of continuous scale invariance. Here, we propose a generalized material failure law based on the log-periodic power law, which better captures the discrete scale invariance inherent in intermittent rupture dynamics. Our method's superiority is demonstrated through testing on 109 historical geohazard events, including landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions. The results indicate that our method is general and robust, offering significant potential to forecast catastrophic failures.</description>

      <title>Groundwater dynamics beneath a marine ice sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sedimentary basins beneath many Antarctic ice streams host substantial volumes of groundwater, which can be exchanged with a "shallow" subglacial hydrological system of till and channelised water. This exchange contributes substantially to basal water budgets, which in turn modulate the flow of ice streams. The geometry of these sedimentary basins is known to be complex, and the groundwater therein has been observed to vary in salinity due to historic seawater intrusion. However, little is known about the hydraulic properties of subglacial sedimentary basins, and the factors controlling groundwater exfiltration and infiltration. We develop a mathematical model for two-dimensional groundwater flow beneath a marine-terminating ice stream on geological timescales, taking into account the effect of seawater intrusion. We find that seawater may become "trapped" in subglacial sedimentary basins, through cycles of grounding line advance and retreat or through "pockets" arising from basin geometry. In addition, we estimate the sedimentary basin permeability which reproduces field observations of groundwater salinity profiles from beneath Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica. Exchange of groundwater with the shallow hydrological system is primarily controlled by basin geometry, with groundwater being exfiltrated where the basin becomes shallower and re-infiltrating where it becomes deeper. However, seawater intrusion also has non-negligible effects on this exchange.</description>

      <title>DiffESM: Conditional Emulation of Temperature and Precipitation in Earth System Models with 3D Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential for understanding the interaction between human activities and the Earth's climate. However, the computational demands of ESMs often limit the number of simulations that can be run, hindering the robust analysis of risks associated with extreme weather events. While low-cost climate emulators have emerged as an alternative to emulate ESMs and enable rapid analysis of future climate, many of these emulators only provide output on at most a monthly frequency. This temporal resolution is insufficient for analyzing events that require daily characterization, such as heat waves or heavy precipitation. We propose using diffusion models, a class of generative deep learning models, to effectively downscale ESM output from a monthly to a daily frequency. Trained on a handful of ESM realizations, reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly mean precipitation or temperature as input, and is capable of producing daily values with statistical characteristics close to ESM output. Combined with a low-cost emulator providing monthly means, this approach requires only a small fraction of the computational resources needed to run a large ensemble. We evaluate model behavior using a number of extreme metrics, showing that DiffESM closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.</description>
