      <title>An Analysis of Intent-Based Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms for decentralized finance on blockchains suffer from various problems, including suboptimal price execution for users, latency, and a worse user experience compared to their centralized counterparts. Recently, off-chain marketplaces, colloquially called `intent markets,' have been proposed as a solution to these problems. In these markets, agents called \emph{solvers} compete to satisfy user orders, which may include complicated user-specified conditions. We provide two formal models of solvers' strategic behavior: one probabilistic and another deterministic. In our first model, solvers initially pay upfront costs to enter a Dutch auction to fill the user's order and then exert congestive, costly effort to search for prices for the user. Our results show that the costs incurred by solvers result in restricted entry in the market. Further, in the presence of costly effort and congestion, our results counter-intuitively show that a planner who aims to maximize user welfare may actually prefer to restrict entry, resulting in limited oligopoly. We then introduce an alternative, optimization-based deterministic model which corroborates these results. We conclude with extensions of our model to other auctions within blockchains and non-cryptocurrency applications, such as the US SEC's Proposal 615.</description>

      <title>MEBS: Multi-task End-to-end Bid Shading for Multi-slot Display Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online bidding and auction are crucial aspects of the online advertising industry. Conventionally, there is only one slot for ad display and most current studies focus on it. Nowadays, multi-slot display advertising is gradually becoming popular where many ads could be displayed in a list and shown as a whole to users. However, multi-slot display advertising leads to different cost-effectiveness. Advertisers have the incentive to adjust bid prices so as to win the most economical ad positions. In this study, we introduce bid shading into multi-slot display advertising for bid price adjustment with a Multi-task End-to-end Bid Shading(MEBS) method. We prove the optimality of our method theoretically and examine its performance experimentally. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, and we obtain a 7.01% lift in Gross Merchandise Volume, a 7.42% lift in Return on Investment, and a 3.26% lift in ad buy count.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information, where the informed player (Player 1) has a categorical payoff type unknown to the uninformed player (Player 2). The goal of Player 1 is to minimize his payoff without violating the constraints, while that of Player 2 is to either violate the state constraints, or otherwise, to maximize the payoff. One example of the game is a man-to-man matchup in football. Without state constraints, Cardaliaguet (2007) showed that the value of such a game exists and is convex to the common belief of players. Our theoretical contribution is an extension of this result to differential games with state constraints and the derivation of the primal and dual subdynamic principles necessary for computing the behavioral strategies. Compared with existing works on imperfect-information dynamic games that focus on scalability and generalization, our focus is instead on revealing the mechanism of belief manipulation behaviors resulted from information asymmetry and state constraints. We use a simplified football game to demonstrate the utility of this work, where we reveal player positions and belief states in which the attacker should (or should not) play specific random fake moves to take advantage of information asymmetry, and compute how the defender should respond.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Two-Stage Facility Location with Atomic Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider competitive facility location as a two-stage multi-agent system with two types of clients. For a given host graph with weighted clients on the vertices, first facility agents strategically select vertices for opening their facilities. Then, the clients strategically select which of the opened facilities in their neighborhood to patronize. Facilities want to attract as much client weight as possible, clients want to minimize congestion on the chosen facility.
  All recently studied versions of this model assume that clients can split their weight strategically. We consider clients with unsplittable weights, but allow mixed strategies. So clients may randomize over which facility to patronize. Besides modeling a natural client behavior, this subtle change yields drastic changes, e.g., for a given facility placement, qualitatively different client equilibria are possible.
  As our main result, we show that pure subgame perfect equilibria always exist if all client weights are identical. For this, we use a novel potential function argument, employing a hierarchical classification of the clients and sophisticated rounding in each step. In contrast, for non-identical clients, we show that deciding the existence of even approximately stable states is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we give a tight bound of 2 on the price of anarchy which implies high social welfare of equilibria, if they exist.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Federated Learning Algorithms without Data Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data similarity assumptions have traditionally been relied upon to understand the convergence behaviors of federated learning methods. Unfortunately, this approach often demands fine-tuning step sizes based on the level of data similarity. When data similarity is low, these small step sizes result in an unacceptably slow convergence speed for federated methods. In this paper, we present a novel and unified framework for analyzing the convergence of federated learning algorithms without the need for data similarity conditions. Our analysis centers on an inequality that captures the influence of step sizes on algorithmic convergence performance. By applying our theorems to well-known federated algorithms, we derive precise expressions for three widely used step size schedules: fixed, diminishing, and step-decay step sizes, which are independent of data similarity conditions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of the performance of these federated learning algorithms, employing the proposed step size strategies to train deep neural network models on benchmark datasets under varying data similarity conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and overall performance, marking a substantial advancement in federated learning research.</description>

      <title>The Exchange Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auctions are widely used in exchanges to match buy and sell requests. Once the buyers and sellers place their requests, the exchange determines how these requests are to be matched. The two most popular objectives used while determining the matching are maximizing volume at a uniform price and maximizing volume with dynamic pricing. In this work, we study the algorithmic complexity of the problems arising from these matching tasks.
  We present a linear time algorithm for uniform price matching which is an improvement over the previous algorithms that take $O(n\log n)$ time to match $n$ requests. For dynamic price matching, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n)$ on the running time, thereby proving that the currently known best algorithm is time-optimal.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture about Parrondo's paradox for two-armed slot machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1936 Mills Futurity slot machine had the feature that, if a player loses 10 times in a row, the 10 lost coins are returned. Ethier and Lee (2010) studied a generalized version of this machine, with 10 replaced by J. They established the Parrondo effect for a hypothetical two-armed machine with the Futurity award. Specifically, arm A and arm B, played individually, are asymptotically fair, but when alternated ran-domly (the so-called random mixture strategy), the casino makes money in the long run. They also considered the nonrandom periodic pattern strategy for patterns with r As and s Bs (e.g., ABABB if r = 2 and s = 3). They established the Parrondo effect if r + s divides J, and conjectured it in four other situations, including the case J = 2 with r &gt;= 1 and s &gt;= 1. We prove the conjecture in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium for Crowd Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of finding mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for crowd navigation. Mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium provides a rigorous model for the robot to anticipate uncertain yet cooperative human behavior in crowds, but the computation cost is often too high for scalable and real-time decision-making. Here we prove that a simple iterative Bayesian updating scheme converges to the Nash equilibrium of a mixed-strategy social navigation game. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven framework to construct the game by initializing agent strategies as Gaussian processes learned from human datasets. Based on the proposed mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium model, we develop a sampling-based crowd navigation framework that can be integrated into existing navigation methods and runs in real-time on a laptop CPU. We evaluate our framework in both simulated environments and real-world human datasets in unstructured environments. Our framework consistently outperforms both non-learning and learning-based methods on both safety and navigation efficiency and reaches human-level crowd navigation performance on top of a meta-planner.</description>
