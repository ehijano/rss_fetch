      <title>Constructing Set-Compositional and Negated Representations for First-Stage Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set compositional and negated queries are crucial for expressing complex information needs and enable the discovery of niche items like Books about non-European monarchs. Despite the recent advances in LLMs, first-stage ranking remains challenging due to the requirement of encoding documents and queries independently from each other. This limitation calls for constructing compositional query representations that encapsulate logical operations or negations, and can be used to match relevant documents effectively. In the first part of this work, we explore constructing such representations in a zero-shot setting using vector operations between lexically grounded Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) representations. Specifically, we introduce Disentangled Negation that penalizes only the negated parts of a query, and a Combined Pseudo-Term approach that enhances LSRs ability to handle intersections. We find that our zero-shot approach is competitive and often outperforms retrievers fine-tuned on compositional data, highlighting certain limitations of LSR and Dense Retrievers. Finally, we address some of these limitations and improve LSRs representation power for negation, by allowing them to attribute negative term scores and effectively penalize documents containing the negated terms.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Query Routing for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query routing for retrieval-augmented generation aims to assign an input query to the most suitable search engine. Existing works rely heavily on supervised datasets that require extensive manual annotation, resulting in high costs and limited scalability, as well as poor generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that constructs the "upper-bound" response to evaluate the quality of retrieval-augmented responses. This evaluation enables the decision of the most suitable search engine for a given query. By eliminating manual annotations, our approach can automatically process large-scale real user queries and create training data. We conduct extensive experiments across five datasets, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>TriMod Fusion for Multimodal Named Entity Recognition in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms serve as invaluable sources of user-generated content, offering insights into various aspects of human behavior. Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a crucial role in analyzing such content by identifying and categorizing named entities into predefined classes. However, traditional NER models often struggle with the informal, contextually sparse, and ambiguous nature of social media language. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on multimodal approaches that leverage both textual and visual cues for enhanced entity recognition. Despite advances, existing methods face limitations in capturing nuanced mappings between visual objects and textual entities and addressing distributional disparities between modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual, visual, and hashtag features (TriMod), utilizing Transformer-attention for effective modality fusion. The improvements exhibited by our model suggest that named entities can greatly benefit from the auxiliary context provided by multiple modalities, enabling more accurate recognition. Through the experiments on a multimodal social media dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score.</description>

      <title>Optimize Incompatible Parameters through Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have become foundational to advancements in multiple domains, including recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so on. Despite their successes, these models often contain incompatible parameters that can be underutilized or detrimental to model performance, particularly when faced with specific, varying data distributions. Existing research excels in removing such parameters or merging the outputs of multiple different pretrained models. However, the former focuses on efficiency rather than performance, while the latter requires several times more computing and storage resources to support inference. In this paper, we set the goal to explicitly improve these incompatible parameters by leveraging the complementary strengths of different models, thereby directly enhancing the models without any additional parameters. Specifically, we propose Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration (CKI), which consists of Parameter Compatibility Assessment and Parameter Splicing, which are used to evaluate the knowledge content of multiple models and integrate the knowledge into one model, respectively. The integrated model can be used directly for inference or for further fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets for recommendation and language tasks, and the results show that Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration can effectively optimize incompatible parameters under multiple tasks and settings to break through the training limit of the original model without increasing the inference cost.</description>

      <title>Eliciting In-context Retrieval and Reasoning for Long-context Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context language models (LCLMs) promise to transform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by simplifying pipelines. With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly -- a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with our best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match on LOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervised fine-tuning, respectively. It even outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on most tasks despite being a much smaller model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical information is essential for technical work, but its creation, interpretation, and search are challenging. To help address these challenges, researchers have developed multimodal search engines and mathematical question answering systems. This book begins with a simple framework characterizing the information tasks that people and systems perform as we work to answer math-related questions. The framework is used to organize and relate the other core topics of the book, including interactions between people and systems, representing math formulas in sources, and evaluation. We close by addressing some key questions and presenting directions for future work. This book is intended for students, instructors, and researchers interested in systems that help us find and use mathematical information.</description>

      <title>Spacewalker: Traversing Representation Spaces for Fast Interactive Exploration and Annotation of Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, analysis of unstructured textual data presents significant challenges for analysis and decision making. Uncovering patterns within large-scale corpora and understanding their semantic impact is critical, but depends on domain experts or resource-intensive manual reviews. In response, we introduce Spacewalker in this system demonstration paper, an interactive tool designed to analyze, explore, and annotate data across multiple modalities. It allows users to extract data representations, visualize them in low-dimensional spaces and traverse large datasets either exploratory or by querying regions of interest. We evaluated Spacewalker through extensive experiments and annotation studies, assessing its efficacy in improving data integrity verification and annotation. We show that Spacewalker reduces time and effort compared to traditional methods. The code of this work is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/code-lukas/Spacewalker</description>
