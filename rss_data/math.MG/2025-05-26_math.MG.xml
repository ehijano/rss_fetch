      <title>$L^p$ measure equivalence of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify compactly generated locally compact groups of polynomial growth up to $L^p$ measure equivalence (ME) for all $p\leq 1$.
  To achieve this, we combine rigidity results (previously proved for discrete groups by Bowen and Austin) with new constructions of explicit orbit equivalences between simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. In particular, we prove that for every pair of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups there is an $L^p$ orbit equivalence for some $p&gt;0$, where we can choose $p&gt;1$ if and only if the groups have isomorphic asymptotic cones. We also prove analogous results for lattices in simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. This yields a strong converse of Austin's Theorem that two nilpotent groups which are $L^1$ ME have isomorphic Carnot graded groups.
  We also address the much harder problem of extending this classification to $L^p$ ME for $p&gt;1$: we obtain the first rigidity results, providing examples of nilpotent groups with isomorphic Carnot graded groups (hence $L^1$ OE) which are not $L^p$ ME for some finite (explicit) $p$. For this we introduce a new technique, which consists of combining induction of cohomology and scaling limits via the use of a theorem of Cantrell.
  Finally, in the appendix, we extend theorems of Bowen, Austin and Cantrell on $L^1$ ME to locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and quasiconformal distortion of intermediate dimension with applications to conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distortion of intermediate dimension under supercritical Sobolev mappings and also under quasiconformal or quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. In particular, we extend to the setting of intermediate dimensions both the Gehring--V\"ais\"al\"a theorem on dilatation-dependent quasiconformal distortion of dimension and Kovalev's theorem on the nonexistence of metric spaces with conformal dimension strictly between zero and one. Applications include new contributions to the quasiconformal classification of Euclidean sets and a new sufficient condition for the vanishing of conformal box-counting dimension. We illustrate our conclusions with specific consequences for Bedford--McMullen carpets, samples of Mandelbrot percolation, and product sets containing a polynomially convergent sequence factor.</description>

      <title>A semidefinite programming hierarchy for covering problems in discrete geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new semidefinite programming hierarchy for covering problems in compact metric spaces. Over the last years, these kind of hierarchies were developed primarily for geometric packing and for energy minimization problems; they frequently provide the best known bounds. Starting from a semidefinite programming hierarchy for the dominating set problem in graph theory, we derive the new hierarchy for covering and show some of its basic properties: The hierarchy converges in finitely many steps, but the first level collapses to the volume bound when the compact metric space is homogeneous.</description>
