      <title>Fibonometry and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, Conway and Ryba wrote a fascinating paper called Fibonometry. The paper, as one might guess, is about the connection between Fibonacci numbers and trigonometry. We were fascinated by this paper and looked at how we could generalize it. We discovered that we weren't the first. In this paper, we describe our journey and summarize the results.</description>

      <title>Remark on Pascal's Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a series of elementary exercises, we explain the fractal structure of Pascal's triangle when written modulo $p$ using an 1852 theorem due to Kummer: A prime $p$ divides $\dfrac {n!}{i!j!} $ if and only if there is a carry in the addition $i+j=n$ when written in base $p$.</description>

      <title>An assessment of peer instruction in large first year mathematics courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent studies have expounded the benefits of active learning in tertiary education. It can be challenging to implement these techniques at large scale (for example in first year mathematics courses). A common method for actively engaging students in large classes is through online quizzes, which may include peer instruction. In this paper, we investigate the effect of having students answer quiz-style questions during class both with and without discussion in a first year mathematics course. We also investigate the short- and long-term effects of each protocol.
  We find that peer instruction improves student learning in mathematics in the following ways: First, when the responses to questions was measured before and after peer instruction the proportion of questions answered correctly increased by 0.2; second, when correct responses were compared to similar questions the following week the proportion correct increased by 0.34 (compared to 0.07 for the control); finally, when measured at the end of the semester the proportion of questions answered correctly increased by 0.42 (compared to 0.2 for the control).</description>
