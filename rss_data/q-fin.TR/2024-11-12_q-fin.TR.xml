      <title>Optimal Execution with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the development of an optimal execution strategy through reinforcement learning, aiming to determine the most effective approach for traders to buy and sell inventory within a limited time frame. Our proposed model leverages input features derived from the current state of the limit order book.
  To simulate this environment and overcome the limitations associated with relying on historical data, we utilize the multi-agent market simulator ABIDES, which provides a diverse range of depth levels within the limit order book.
  We present a custom MDP formulation followed by the results of our methodology and benchmark the performance against standard execution strategies. Our findings suggest that the reinforcement learning-based approach demonstrates significant potential.</description>

      <title>Daily Liquidity Jump and Diffusion, and Treatment on Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash trading among crypto assets induces short-term price jumps, which manifest as liquidity fluctuation. We develop a model to decompose asset liquidity into two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which quantify the size and probability of wash trading. Using the trading data from US stock markets as a benchmark, we establish that the combination of high liquidity diffusion and high liquidity jump indicates wash trading. On the other hand, the majority of large-volume trades with high liquidity jump but low liquidity diffusion (&lt;1) are actually legitimate ones. Our model provides advice to investors in making informed decisions in crypto investments, and to regulators in taking targeted actions to combat wash trading. While we use crypto assets to exemplify the utilities of our model, the model should remain effective for other asset classes with extreme liquidity.</description>

      <title>Approaching multifractal complexity in decentralized cryptocurrency trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifractality is a concept that helps compactly grasping the most essential features of the financial dynamics. In its fully developed form, this concept applies to essentially all mature financial markets and even to more liquid cryptocurrencies traded on the centralized exchanges. A new element that adds complexity to cryptocurrency markets is the possibility of decentralized trading. Based on the extracted tick-by-tick transaction data from the Universal Router contract of the Uniswap decentralized exchange, from June 6, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the present study using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) shows that even though liquidity on these new exchanges is still much lower compared to centralized exchanges convincing traces of multifractality are already emerging on this new trading as well. The resulting multifractal spectra are however strongly left-side asymmetric which indicates that this multifractality comes primarily from large fluctuations and small ones are more of the uncorrelated noise type. What is particularly interesting here is the fact that multifractality is more developed for time series representing transaction volumes than rates of return. On the level of these larger events a trace of multifractal cross-correlations between the two characteristics is also observed.</description>
