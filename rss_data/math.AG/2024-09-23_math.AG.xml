      <title>A pro-cdh topology on formal schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a pro-cdh topology on formal schemes and prove that the $\infty$-topos of pro-cdh sheaves of spaces has an optimal bound of homotopy dimension. This remedies a defect for a pro-cdh topology on schemes introduced in [KS23]. As an application, we give a topos-theoretic interpretation of Weibel's vanishing of negative K-theory and motivic cohomology of Elmanto and Morrow.</description>

      <title>Duality of differential operators and algebraic de Rham cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth proper morphism $f\colon X\rightarrow S$, we introduce a certain derived category where morphisms are permitted to be $\mathcal{O}_S$-linear differential operators. We then prove a generalisation of Serre duality that applies to two-term complexes of this type. We apply this to give a new proof of Poincar\'e duality for relative algebraic de Rham cohomology.</description>

      <title>Pushforward of Siegel flag varieties in the Chow ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reductive group, choice of maximal torus and Borel subgroup, and two subsets of the simple roots, one obtains a closed embedding of sub flag varieties. In this paper we compute the class of the sub flag variety in the Chow ring for the Siegel case where the group is the general symplectic group and the parabolic stabilises a maximal isotropic subspace. This corresponds, under the isomorphism with the tautological ring of the compactified moduli space of abelian varieties, to the generator of the classes in the tautological ring which are supported on the toroidal boundary. We conjecture that this is not a coincidence.</description>

      <title>On analogues of the Kato conjectures and proper base change for $1$-cycles on rationally connected varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986, Kato set up a framework of conjectures relating (higher) $0$-cycles and \'etale cohomology for smooth projective schemes over finite fields or rings of integers in local fields through the homology of so-called Kato complexes. In analogy, we develop a framework of conjectures for $1$-cycles on smooth projective rationally connected varieties over algebraically closed fields and for families of such varieties over henselian discrete valuation rings with algebraically closed fields. This is partly motivated by results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene-Voisin [3] in dimension $3$. We prove some special cases building on recent results of Koll\'ar-Tian [16].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a previous result by Fabricius-Bjerre from curves in $\mathbb R^2$ to curves in $\mathbb R P^2$. Applied to the case of real algebraic curves, this recovers the signed count of bitangents of quartics introduced by Larson-Vogt and proves its positivity, conjectured by Larson-Vogt. Our method is not specific to quartics and applies to algebraic curves of any degree.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximate definable choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A definable choice is a semialgebraic selection of one point in every fiber of the projection of a semialgebraic set. Definable choices exist by semialgebraic triviality, but their complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables. By allowing the selection to be approximate (in the Hausdorff sense), we quantitatively improve this result. In particular, we construct an approximate selection with degree that is linear in the complexity of the original set, and independent on the number of variables. This work is motivated by infinite-dimensional applications, in particular to the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry. To prove these results, we develop a general quantitative theory for Hausdorff approximations in semialgebraic geometry, which has independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the 1-loop, 2-vertex correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbash and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $S_{e^\vee}$ and Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>

      <title>Injectivity theorems for higher direct images under proper K\"ahler morphisms on snc spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold, and let $Y$ and $D$ be two reduced simple-normal-crossing (snc) divisors on $X$ with no common irreducible components. Given a proper locally K\"ahler morphism $\pi \colon X \to \Delta$ from $X$ to a complex analytic space $\Delta$, we prove Fujino's conjecture on the injectivity theorem in the relative setting in a generalized form. Specifically, we establish an injectivity result for the higher direct images under $\pi$ for the lc pairs $(X, D)$ as well as $(Y, D_Y)$, where $D_Y := D \cap Y$. As an application, this result immediately implies the injectivity theorem on holomorphically convex K\"ahler manifolds with reduced snc divisors. The main technique in the proof consists of the theory of harmonic integrals together with residue formulae associated with adjoint ideal sheaves, which are developed from our previous work for the absolute case (where $\Delta$ is a point and $X$ is compact). Additionally, we make use of the Takegoshi harmonic forms to deal with the non-compactness of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will consider $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'{\i}guez Camargo.</description>

      <title>On Rees algebras of ideals and modules with weak residual conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a module of projective dimension one over $R=k[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$. If $E$ is presented by a matrix $\varphi$ with linear entries and the number of generators of $E$ is bounded locally up to codimension $d-1$, the Rees ring $\mathcal{R}(E)$ is well understood. In this paper, we study $\mathcal{R}(E)$ when this generation condition holds only up to codimension $s-1$, for some $s&lt;d$. Moreover, we provide a generating set for the ideal defining this algebra by employing a method of successive approximations of the Rees ring. Although we employ techniques regarding Rees rings of modules, our findings recover and extend known results for Rees algebras of perfect ideals with grade two in the case that $\mathrm{rank} \, E=1$.</description>

Abstract: Given two ideals $I$ and $J$ of the ring $\mathcal O_n$ of analytic function germs $f:(\mathbb C^n,0)\to \mathbb C$, we show a sharp lower bound for the log canonical threshold of $IJ$ in terms of the sequences of mixed {\L}ojasiewicz exponents of them. In particular, in the case where $J$ is the maximal ideal, the corresponding equality holds if and only if the integral closure of $I$ equals some power of the maximal ideal.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Mahler measures and special values of $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Mahler measures of two well-studied families of bivariate polynomials, namely $P_t=x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1}+\sqrt{t}$ and $Q_t=x^3+y^3+1-\sqrt[3]{t}xy$, where $t$ is a complex parameter. In the cases when the zero loci of these polynomials define CM elliptic curves over number fields, we derive general formulas for their Mahler measures in terms of $L$-values of cusp forms. For each family, we also classify all possible values of $t$ in number fields of degree not exceeding $4$ for which the corresponding elliptic curves have complex multiplication. Finally, for all such values of $t$ in totally real number fields of degree $n=2$ and $n=4$, corresponding to elliptic curves $\mathcal{F}_t$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}_t$), we prove that determinants of $n\times n$ matrices whose entries are Mahler measures corresponding to their Galois conjugates are non-zero rational multiples of $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{F}_t,0)$ (resp. $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{C}_t,0)$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the exact counting of all elliptic curves over $K = \mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\mathrm{char}(K) &gt; 3$ by Bejleri, Satriano and the author, together with the torsion-free nature of most elliptic curves over global function fields proven by Phillips, and the overarching conjecture of Goldfeld and Katz-Sarnak regarding the ``Distribution of Ranks of Elliptic Curves''. Consequently, we arrive at the quantitative statement which naturally renders even finer conjecture regarding the lower order main terms differing for the number of $E/K$ with $|E(K)| = 1$ and $E(K) = \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a stopped Liouville manifold arising from a Liouville sector, we construct a symplectic analogue of the formal neighborhood of the stop on the level of Fukaya categories. This geometric construction is performed via Floer-theoretic methods by allowing wrappings in the negative direction. On the other hand, inspired by homological mirror symmetry for pairs, where the mirror is the formal neighborhood of a divisor in an ambient projective variety, there is a different approach by taking a `categorical formal completion' introduced by Efimov. Our main results establishes equivalence of these two approaches, confirms computability of this new type of Floer theory by categorical and algebraic means, and indicates contributions from and to computations in homological mirror symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2013, Lee, Li, and Zelevinsky introduced combinatorial objects called compatible pairs to construct the greedy bases for rank-2 cluster algebras, consisting of indecomposable positive elements including the cluster monomials. Subsequently, Rupel extended this construction to the setting of generalized rank-2 cluster algebras by defining compatible gradings. We discover a new class of combinatorial objects which we call tight gradings. Using this, we give a directly computable, manifestly positive, and elementary but highly nontrivial formula describing rank-2 consistent scattering diagrams. This allows us to show that the coefficients of the wall-functions on a generalized cluster scattering diagram of any rank are positive, which implies the Laurent positivity for generalized cluster algebras and the strong positivity of their theta bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1702.03427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kim's wall-crossing formula relating the virtual classes of the moduli spaces of $\epsilon$-stable quasimaps for different $\epsilon$ in any genus, whenever the target is a complete intersection in projective space and there is at least one marked point. Our techniques involve a twisted graph space, which we expect to generalize to yield wall-crossing formulas for general gauged linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of Mochizuki's anabelian variation of ring structures, perfectoid geometry and formal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.06840v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a multiplicative monoid with identity. Then I show that there is a universal one dimensional formal group law equipped with an action of $M$. If $M$ is $p$-perfect (i.e. $m\mapsto m^p$ is an isomorphism for some prime number $p$) then the universal $M$-formal group law comes equipped with a natural Frobenius endomorphism. There are a number of concrete applications of this result. If $K$ is a $p$-adic field and $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_K$ is the multiplicative monoid of the ring of integers of $K$, then there is a universal formal group (over a suitable (non-zero) ring) which is equipped with an action of the multiplicative monoid $\mathcal{O}$. Lubin-Tate formal groups arise from this universal monoid formal group law. This has applications to Mochizuki's anabelian ideas: if two p-adic fields have isomorphic absolute Galois groups then they have isomorphic multiplicative monoids $\mathcal{O}$ (but possibly non-isomorphic ring structures). The existence of the universal monoid formal group law for the monoid $\mathcal{O}$ implies that the additive structures of a ring can be interpolated into a universal algebraic family (while keeping the multiplicative structure of the ring fixed). Here is another important example covered by my result: let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $R^\flat$ be its tilt and the multiplicative monoid $R^\flat$ of $R^\flat$. Then there exists a universal monoid formal group law for this monoid which interpolates the additive structures of untilts with tilt $R^\flat$. Thus in some sense one has a unified approach to various phenomenon which are well-known in anabelian geometry and in perfectoid geometry. These results also provide a natural number field version of Fontaine's fundamental ring $A_{inf}$ of $p$-adic Hodge Theory (Remark~4.2.4).</description>

Abstract: Let $(X, C)$ be a germ of a threefold $X$ with terminal singularities along a connected reduced complete curve $C$ with a contraction $f : (X, C) \to (Z, o)$ such that $C = f^{-1} (o)_{\mathrm{red}}$ and $-K_X$ is $f$-ample. Assume that each irreducible component of $C$ contains at most one point of index $&gt;2$. We prove that a general member $D\in |{-}K_X|$ is a normal surface with Du Val singularities.</description>

Abstract: We give the first examples of smooth projective varieties $X$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ admitting a non-algebraic torsion $\ell$-adic cohomology class of degree $4$ which vanishes over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$. We use them to show that two versions of the integral Tate conjecture over $\mathbb{F}$ are not equivalent to one another and that a fundamental exact sequence of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Kahn does not necessarily split. Some of our examples have dimension $4$, and are the first known examples of fourfolds with non-vanishing $H^{3}_{\text{nr}}(X,\mathbb{Q}_{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{2}(2))$.</description>

      <title>Modified defect relation of Gauss maps on annular ends of minimal surfaces for hypersurfaces of projective varieties in subgeneral position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an annular end of a complete minimal surface $S$ in $\mathbb R^m$ and let $V$ be a $k$-dimension projective subvariety of $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n=m-1)$. Let $g$ be the generalized Gauss map of $S$ into $V\subset\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$. In this paper, we establish a modified defect relation of $g$ on the annular end $A$ for $q$ hypersurfaces $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^q$ of $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$ in $N$-subgeneral position with respect to $V$. Our result implies that the image $g(A)$ cannot omit all $q$ hypersurfaces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_q$ if $g$ is nondegenerate over $I_d(V)$ and $q&gt;\frac{(2N-k+1)(M+1)(M+2d)}{2d(k+1)}$, where $M=H_V(d)-1$ and $d$ is the least of common multiple of $\deg Q_1,\ldots,\deg Q_q$. As our best knowledge, it is the first time the value distribution of the Gauss map on an annular end of a minimal surfaces with hypersurface targets is studied, in particular the product into sum inequality for holomorphic curves on Riemann surfaces with hypersurfaces targets is presented. This our result has been used to study the unicity of the gauss maps in the recent work of C. Lu and X. Chen [14].</description>

      <title>Quantum K theory of Grassmannians, Wilson line operators, and Schur bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a `Whitney' presentation, and a `Coulomb branch' presentation, for the torus equivariant quantum K theory of the Grassmann manifold $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, inspired from physics, and stated in an earlier paper. The first presentation is obtained by quantum deforming the product of the Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the tautological bundles. In physics, the $\lambda_y$ classes arise as certain Wilson line operators. The second presentation is obtained from the Coulomb branch equations involving the partial derivatives of a twisted superpotential from supersymmetric gauge theory. This is closest to a presentation obtained by Gorbounov and Korff, utilizing integrable systems techniques. Algebraically, we relate the Coulomb and Whitney presentations utilizing transition matrices from the (equivariant) Grothendieck polynomials to the (equivariant) complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. Along the way, we calculate K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of wedge powers of the tautological bundles on $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, using the `quantum=classical' statement.</description>

Abstract: In 1874 Brill and Noether designed a seminal geometric method for computing bases of Riemann-Roch spaces. From then, their method has led to several algorithms, some of them being implemented in computer algebra systems. The usual proofs often rely on abstract concepts of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. In this paper we present a short self-contained and elementary proof that mostly needs Newton polygons, Hensel lifting, bivariate resultants, and Chinese remaindering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the basic theory of the coniveau and strong coniveau filtrations to the $\ell$-adic setting. By adapting the examples of Benoist--Ottem to the $\ell$-adic context, we show that the two filtrations differ over any algebraically closed field of characteristic not $2$.
  When the base field $\mathbb{F}$ is finite, we show that the equality of the two filtrations over the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$ has some consequences for algebraic equivalence for codimension-$2$ cycles over $\mathbb{F}$. As an application, we prove that the third unramified cohomology group $H^{3}_{\text{nr}}(X,\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}/\mathbb{Z}_{\ell})$ vanishes for a large class of rationally chain connected threefolds $X$ over $\mathbb{F}$, confirming a conjecture of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Kahn.</description>

Abstract: We study the twisted ampleness criterion due to Collins, Jacob and Yau on surfaces, which is equivalent to the existence of solutions to the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills (dHYM) equation. When $X$ is a Weierstrass elliptic K3 surface, and $\omega$ an ample class such that $\omega$ lies in the span of a section class and the fiber class, we show that for a class of line bundles $L$ with fiber degree 1 and $\omega c_1(L)&gt;0$, the twisted ampleness of $L$ respect to $\omega$, always implies the $\sigma_{\omega, 0}$-stability (Bridgeland stability) of $L$. This answers a question by Collins and Yau for a class of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the first and third author proved a correspondence theorem which recovers the Levine-Welschinger invariants of toric del Pezzo surfaces as a count of tropical curves weighted with arithmetic multiplicities. In this paper, we study properties of the arithmetic count of plane tropical curves satisfying point conditions. We prove that this count is independent of the configuration of point conditions. Moreover, a Caporaso-Harris formula for the arithmetic count of plane tropical curves is obtained by moving one point to the very left. Repeating this process until all point conditions are stretched, we obtain an enriched count of floor diagrams which coincides with the tropical count. Finally, we prove polynomiality properties for the arithmetic counts using floor diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We propose a notion of multi-scale stability conditions with the goal of providing a smooth compactification of the quotient of the space of projectivized Bridgeland stability conditions by the group of autoequivalence. For the case of the 3CY category associated with the $A_n$-quiver this goal is achieved by defining a topology and complex structure that relies on a plumbing construction. We compare this compactification to the multi-scale compactification of quadratic differentials and briefly indicate why even for the Kronecker quiver this notion needs refinement to provide a full compactification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply Clausen-Scholze's theory of solid modules to the existence of adelic decompositions for schemes of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$. Specifically, we use the six-functor formalism for solid modules to define the skeletal filtration of a scheme, and then we show that decomposing a quasi-coherent sheaf with respect to this filtration gives rise to a new construction of the Beilinson-Parshin adelic resolution. As an application of the adelic decomposition combined with some nice completeness properties of the solid tensor product, we prove a version of adelic descent for solid quasi-coherent sheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic residue patterns modulo a prime are studied since 19th century. In the first part we extend existing results on the number of consecutive $\ell$-tuples of quadratic residues, studying corresponding algebraic curves and their jacobians, which happen to be products of jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In the second part we state the last unpublished result of Lydia Goncharova on squares such that their differences are also squares, reformulate it in terms of algebraic geometry of a K3 surface, and prove it. The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.</description>

This generalizes analogous identities for moduli stacks of objects in $3$-Calabi$\unicode{x2013}$Yau abelian categories obtained by Kontsevich$\unicode{x2013}$Soibelman and Joyce$\unicode{x2013}$Song, which are crucial in proving wall-crossing formulae for Donaldson$\unicode{x2013}$Thomas invariants. We expect our identity to be useful in extending motivic Donaldson$\unicode{x2013}$Thomas theory to general $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <title>A moduli space of stable sheaves on a cubic threefold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the moduli space $\overline{M}_{X}(\nu)$ of $H$-Gieseker semistable sheaves on a smooth cubic threefold $X$ with Chern character $\nu=(4,-H,-\frac{5}{6}H^{2},\frac{1}{6}H^{3})$ is non-empty, smooth and irreducible of dimension $8$. Moreover, we give a set-theoretic description of the moduli space $\overline{M}_{X}(\nu)$, which also yields that $\overline{M}_{X}(\nu)$ is a birational model of the moduli space of smooth quartic rational curves in $X$.</description>

      <title>Degree two Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of local curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

      <title>A note on \'etale endomorphisms of normal schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that under some extra hypothesis, given an \'etale endomorphism of a normal irreducible Noetherian and simply connected scheme, if the endomorphism is surjective then it is injective. The additional assumption concerns the possibility of constructing an \'etale cover out of a surjective \'etale morphism. We show that in some cases the surjectivity hypothesis can be removed if the intended \'etale cover is Galois.</description>

      <title>The genus of division algebras over discrete valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field with a set of discrete valuations $V$, we show how the genus of a division algebra over the field is related to the genus of the residue algebras at various valuations in $V$ and the ramification data. When the division algebra is a quaternion, we show the triviality of genus over many fields which include higher local fields, function fields of curves over higher local fields and function fields of curves over real closed fields. We also consider function fields of curves over global fields with a rational point and show how the genus problem is related to the $2$-torsion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of its Jacobian. As a special case, we show how the methods developed yield better bounds on the size of the genus over function fields of elliptic curves and demonstrate how they can be computed directly using arithmetic data of the elliptic curve with a number of examples.</description>

      <title>An injectivity theorem on snc compact K\"ahler spaces: an application of the theory of harmonic integrals on log-canonical centers via adjoint ideal sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,D)$ be a log-canonical (lc) pair, in which $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold and $D$ is a reduced snc divisor, and let $F$ be a holomorphic line bundle on $X$ equipped with a smooth metric $h_F = e^{-\varphi_F}$. Via the use of the adjoint ideal sheaves (constructed from $\varphi_F$ and $D$) and the associated residue morphisms, sections of $K_D \otimes \left. F\right|_D$ on $D$ (as well as those of $K_X \otimes D \otimes F$ on $X$) can be related to the $F$-valued holomorphic top-forms on each lc center of $(X,D)$ by an inductive use of a certain residue exact sequence derived from the adjoint ideal sheaves. The theory of harmonic integrals is valid on each lc center (which is compact K\"ahler), so this provides a pathway to apply the techniques in harmonic theory to the possibly singular K\"ahler space $D$. To illustrate the use of such apparatus in problems concerning lc pairs, we prove a Koll\'ar-type injectivity theorem for the cohomology on $D$ when $F$ is semi-positive. This in turn also solves the conjecture by Fujino on the injectivity theorem for the compact K\"ahler lc pair $(X,D)$, providing an alternative proof of a recent result by Cao and P\u{a}un.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Floer theory I: exponential integrals in finite and infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first of the series of papers devoted to our project ``Holomorphic Floer Theory" we discuss exponential integrals and related wall-crossing structures. We emphasize two points of view on the subject: the one based on the ideas of deformation quantization and the one based on the ideas of Floer theory. Their equivalence is a corollary of our generalized Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In the case of exponential integrals this amounts to several comparison isomorphisms between local and global versions of de Rham and Betti cohomology. We develop the corresponding theories in particular generalizing Morse-Novikov theory to the holomorphic case. We prove that arising wall-crossing structures are analytic. As a corollary, perturbative expansions of exponential integrals are resurgent. Based on a careful study of finite-dimensional exponential integrals we propose a conjectural approach to infinite-dimensional exponential integrals. We illustrate this approach in the case of Feynman path integral with holomorphic Lagrangian boundary conditions as well as in the case of the complexified Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the arising perverse sheaf of infinite rank as well as analyticity of the corresponding ``Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure". We develop a general theory of quantum wave functions and show that in the case of Chern-Simons theory it gives an alternative description of the Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure based on the notion of generalized Nahm sum. We propose several conjectures about analyticity and resurgence of the corresponding perturbative series.</description>

      <title>The solving degrees for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the solving degrees for affine semi-regular sequences and their homogenized sequences. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence. This paper is a sequel of the authors' previous work and gives additional results on the solving degrees and important behaviors of Gr\"obner basis computation.
  We also define the generalized degree of regularity for a sequence of homogeneous polynomials. For the ideal generated by the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence, we relate its generalized degree of regularity with its maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree (i.e., the solving degree for the homogenized sequence). The definition of a generalized (cryptographic) semi-regular sequence is also given, and it derives a new cryptographic assumption to estimate the security of cryptosystems. From our experimental observation, we raise a conjecture and some questions related to this generalized semi-regularity. These definitions and our results provide a theoretical formulation of (somehow heuristic) discussions done so far in the cryptographic community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Bourqui's work on anticanonical height zeta functions on Hirzebruch surfaces, we study height zeta functions of split toric varieties with Picard rank 2 over global function fields, with respect to height functions associated with big metrized line bundles. We show that these varieties can be naturally decomposed into a finite disjoint union of subvarieties, where precise analytic properties of the corresponding height zeta functions can be given. As application, we obtain asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points of large height on each subvariety, with explicit leading constants and controlled error terms.</description>
