      <title>A Collaborative PIM Computing Optimization Framework for Multi-Tenant DNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly utilizing multi-tenant deep neural networks (DNNs), which lead to a significant rise in computing complexity and the need for computing parallelism. ReRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) computing, with its high density and low power consumption characteristics, holds promising potential for supporting the deployment of multi-tenant DNNs. However, direct deployment of complex multi-tenant DNNs on exsiting ReRAM-based PIM designs poses challenges. Resource contention among different tenants can result in sever under-utilization of on-chip computing resources. Moreover, area-intensive operators and computation-intensive operators require excessively large on-chip areas and long processing times, leading to high overall latency during parallel computing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ReRAM-based in-memory computing framework that enables efficient deployment of multi-tenant DNNs on ReRAM-based PIM designs. Our approach tackles the resource contention problems by iteratively partitioning the PIM hardware at tenant level. In addition, we construct a fine-grained reconstructed processing pipeline at the operator level to handle area-intensive operators. Compared to the direct deployments on traditional ReRAM-based PIM designs, our proposed PIM computing framework achieves significant improvements in speed (ranges from 1.75x to 60.43x) and energy(up to 1.89x).</description>

      <title>Noise-augmented Chaotic Ising Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Sampling</title>

Abstract: The rise of domain-specific computing has led to great interest in Ising machines, dedicated hardware accelerators tailored to solve combinatorial optimization and probabilistic sampling problems. A key element of Ising machines is stochasticity, which enables a wide exploration of configurations, thereby helping avoid local minima. Here, we evaluate and improve the previously proposed concept of coupled chaotic bits (c-bits) that operate without any explicit stochasticity. We show that augmenting chaotic bits with stochasticity leads to better algorithmic scaling in combinatorial optimization problems, comparable to the performance of probabilistic bits (p-bits) which have explicit randomness in their update rules. We first demonstrate that c-bits surprisingly follow the quantum Boltzmann law in a 1D transverse field Ising model, despite the lack of explicit randomness. We then show that c-bits exhibit critical dynamics similar to those of stochastic p-bits in 2D Ising and 3D spin glass models, with promising potential to solve challenging optimization problems. Finally, we propose a noise-augmented version of coupled c-bits via the powerful adaptive parallel tempering algorithm (APT). The noise-augmented c-bit algorithm outperforms fully deterministic c-bits running versions of the simulated annealing algorithm. Chaotic Ising machines closely resemble coupled oscillator-based Ising machines, as both schemes exploit nonlinear dynamics for computation. Oscillator-based Ising machines may greatly benefit from our proposed algorithm, which runs replicas at constant temperature, eliminating the need to globally modulate coupling strengths. Mixing stochasticity with deterministic c-bits creates a powerful hybrid computing scheme that can bring benefits in scaled, asynchronous, and massively parallel hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Hamiltonian Assembly: Enhancing the training of combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum machine learning is the design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Much like in deep learning, vanishing gradients pose significant obstacles to the trainability of PQCs, arising from various sources. One such source is the presence of non-local loss functions, which require the measurement of a large subset of qubits involved. To address this issue and facilitate parameter training for quantum applications using global loss functions, we propose Sequential Hamiltonian Assembly (SHA). SHA iteratively approximates the loss by assembling it from local components. To further demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we extend our previous case study by introducing a new partitioning strategy, a new merger between QAOA and SHA, and an evaluation of SHA onto the Max-Cut optimization problem. Simulation results show that SHA outperforms conventional parameter training by 43.89% and the empirical state-of-the-art, Layer-VQE by 29.08% in the mean accuracy for Max-Cut. This paves the way for locality-aware learning techniques, mitigating vanishing gradients for a large class of practically relevant problems.</description>

      <title>AcousAF: Acoustic Sensing-Based Atrial Fibrillation Detection System for Mobile Phones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution. However, these systems have various applicability issues, such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present AcousAF, a novel AF detection system based on acoustic sensors of smartphones. Particularly, we explore the potential of pulse wave acquisition from the wrist using smartphone speakers and microphones. In addition, we propose a well-designed framework comprised of pulse wave probing, pulse wave extraction, and AF detection to ensure accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 20 participants utilizing our custom data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our system, with 92.8% accuracy, 86.9% precision, 87.4% recall, and 87.1% F1 Score.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design and Implementation of FIDO2 compatible Smart Card for Decentralized Financial Transaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With challenges and limitations associated with security in the fintech industry, the rise to the need for data protection increases. However, the current existing passwordless and password-based peer to peer transactions in online banking systems are vulnerable to advanced forms of digital attacks. The influx of modern data protection methods keeps better records of the transactions, but it still does not address the issue of authentication and account takeovers during transactions. To the address the mentioned issue, this paper proposes a novel and robust peer to peer transaction system which employs best cloud security practices, proper use of cryptography and trusted computing to mitigate common vulnerabilities. We will be implementing FIDO2 compatible Smart Card to securely authenticate the user using physical smart cards and store the records in the cloud which enables access control by allowing access only when an access is requested. The standard incorporates multiple layers of security on cloud computing models to ensure secrecy of the said data. Services of the standard adhere to regulations provides by the government and assures privacy to the information of the payee or the end-user. The whole system has been implemented in the Internet of Things scenario.</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled learning: co-design of neuromorphic hardware topology for neuromorphic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware-based neuromorphic computing remains an elusive goal with the potential to profoundly impact future technologies and deepen our understanding of emergent intelligence. The learning-from-mistakes algorithm is one of the few training algorithms inspired by the brain's simple learning rules, utilizing inhibition and pruning to demonstrate self-organized learning. Here we implement this algorithm in purely neuromorphic memristive hardware through a co-design process. This implementation requires evaluating hardware trade-offs and constraints. It has been shown that learning-from-mistakes successfully trains small networks to function as binary classifiers and perceptrons. However, without tailoring the hardware to the algorithm, performance decreases exponentially as the network size increases. When implementing neuromorphic algorithms on neuromorphic hardware, we investigate the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity, the latter being the number of learnable patterns. We emphasize the significance of topology and the use of governing equations, demonstrating theoretical tools to aid in the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and algorithms. We provide quantitative techniques to evaluate the computational capacity of a neuromorphic device based on the measurements performed and the underlying circuit structure. This approach shows that breaking the symmetry of a neural network can increase both the controllability and average network capacity. By pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive device circuits leverage stochastic resources to drive local contrast in network weights. Our combined experimental and simulation efforts explore the parameters that make a network suited for displaying emergent intelligence from simple rules.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum Embedding: Pushing the Limits of Quantum Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum embedding is a fundamental prerequisite for applying quantum machine learning techniques to classical data, and has substantial impacts on performance outcomes. In this study, we present Neural Quantum Embedding (NQE), a method that efficiently optimizes quantum embedding beyond the limitations of positive and trace-preserving maps by leveraging classical deep learning techniques. NQE enhances the lower bound of the empirical risk, leading to substantial improvements in classification performance. Moreover, NQE improves robustness against noise. To validate the effectiveness of NQE, we conduct experiments on IBM quantum devices for image data classification, resulting in a remarkable accuracy enhancement from 0.52 to 0.96. In addition, numerical analyses highlight that NQE simultaneously improves the trainability and generalization performance of quantum neural networks, as well as of the quantum kernel method.</description>
