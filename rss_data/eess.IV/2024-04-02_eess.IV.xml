      <title>Boosting Cardiac Color Doppler Frame Rates with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography enables visualization of blood flow within the heart. However, the limited frame rate impedes the quantitative assessment of blood velocity throughout the cardiac cycle, thereby compromising a comprehensive analysis of ventricular filling. Concurrently, deep learning is demonstrating promising outcomes in post-processing of echocardiographic data for various applications. This work explores the use of deep learning models for intracardiac Doppler velocity estimation from a reduced number of filtered I/Q signals. We used a supervised learning approach by simulating patient-based cardiac color Doppler acquisitions and proposed data augmentation strategies to enlarge the training dataset. We implemented architectures based on convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focused on comparing the U-Net model and the recent ConvNeXt models, alongside assessing real-valued versus complex-valued representations.  We found that both models outperformed the state-of-the-art autocorrelator method, effectively mitigating aliasing and noise. We did not observe significant differences between the use of real and complex data. Finally, we validated the models on in vitro and in vivo experiments. All models produced quantitatively comparable results to the baseline and were more robust to noise. ConvNeXt emerged as the sole model to achieve high-quality results on in vivo aliased samples. These results demonstrate the interest of supervised deep learning methods for Doppler velocity estimation from a reduced number of acquisitions.</description>

      <title>FetalDiffusion: Pose-Controllable 3D Fetal MRI Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of fetal MRI is significantly affected by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion, leading to the introduction of artifacts even when fast acquisition sequences are employed. The development of 3D real-time fetal pose estimation approaches on volumetric EPI fetal MRI opens up a promising avenue for fetal motion monitoring and prediction. Challenges arise in fetal pose estimation due to limited number of real scanned fetal MR training images, hindering model generalization when the acquired fetal MRI lacks adequate pose.
  In this study, we introduce FetalDiffusion, a novel approach utilizing a conditional diffusion model to generate 3D synthetic fetal MRI with controllable pose. Additionally, an auxiliary pose-level loss is adopted to enhance model performance. Our work demonstrates the success of this proposed model by producing high-quality synthetic fetal MRI images with accurate and recognizable fetal poses, comparing favorably with in-vivo real fetal MRI. Furthermore, we show that the integration of synthetic fetal MR images enhances the fetal pose estimation model's performance, particularly when the number of available real scanned data is limited resulting in 15.4% increase in PCK and 50.2% reduced in mean error. All experiments are done on a single 32GB V100 GPU. Our method holds promise for improving real-time tracking models, thereby addressing fetal motion issues more effectively.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Cross-Attentive Multi-modal MRI Fusion Framework for Schizophrenia Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and sMRI) are widely used for the diagnosis of mental disorder. However, combining complementary information from these two modalities is challenging due to their heterogeneity. Many existing methods fall short of capturing the interaction between these modalities, frequently defaulting to a simple combination of latent features. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Multi-modal Fusion framework (CAMF), which aims to capture both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships between fMRI and sMRI, enhancing multi-modal data representation. Specifically, our CAMF framework employs self-attention modules to identify interactions within each modality while cross-attention modules identify interactions between modalities. Subsequently, our approach optimizes the integration of latent features from both modalities. This approach significantly improves classification accuracy, as demonstrated by our evaluations on two extensive multi-modal brain imaging datasets, where CAMF consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, the gradient-guided Score-CAM is applied to interpret critical functional networks and brain regions involved in schizophrenia. The bio-markers identified by CAMF align with established research, potentially offering new insights into the diagnosis and pathological endophenotypes of schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>Learned Scanpaths Aid Blind Panoramic Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic videos have the advantage of providing an immersive and interactive viewing experience. Nevertheless, their spherical nature gives rise to various and uncertain user viewing behaviors, which poses significant challenges for panoramic video quality assessment (PVQA). In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized, blind PVQA method with explicit modeling of user viewing patterns through visual scanpaths. Our method consists of two modules: a scanpath generator and a quality assessor. The scanpath generator is initially trained to predict future scanpaths by minimizing their expected code length and then jointly optimized with the quality assessor for quality prediction. Our blind PVQA method enables direct quality assessment of panoramic images by treating them as videos composed of identical frames. Experiments on three public panoramic image and video quality datasets, encompassing both synthetic and authentic distortions, validate the superiority of our blind PVQA model over existing methods.</description>

      <title>GreenSaliency: A Lightweight and Efficient Image Saliency Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image saliency detection is crucial in understanding human gaze patterns from visual stimuli. The escalating demand for research in image saliency detection is driven by the growing necessity to incorporate such techniques into various computer vision tasks and to understand human visual systems. Many existing image saliency detection methods rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve good performance. However, the high computational complexity associated with these approaches impedes their integration with other modules or deployment on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices. To address this need, we propose a novel image saliency detection method named GreenSaliency, which has a small model size, minimal carbon footprint, and low computational complexity. GreenSaliency can be a competitive alternative to the existing deep-learning-based (DL-based) image saliency detection methods with limited computation resources. GreenSaliency comprises two primary steps: 1) multi-layer hybrid feature extraction and 2) multi-path saliency prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that GreenSaliency achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art DL-based methods while possessing a considerably smaller model size and significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>YNetr: Dual-Encoder architecture on Plain Scan Liver Tumors (PSLT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Liver tumors are abnormal growths in the liver that can be either benign or malignant, with liver cancer being a significant health concern worldwide. However, there is no dataset for plain scan segmentation of liver tumors, nor any related algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose Plain Scan Liver Tumors(PSLT) and YNetr. Methods: A collection of 40 liver tumor plain scan segmentation datasets was assembled and annotated. Concurrently, we utilized Dice coefficient as the metric for assessing the segmentation outcomes produced by YNetr, having advantage of capturing different frequency information. Results: The YNetr model achieved a Dice coefficient of 62.63% on the PSLT dataset, surpassing the other publicly available model by an accuracy margin of 1.22%. Comparative evaluations were conducted against a range of models including UNet 3+, XNet, UNetr, Swin UNetr, Trans-BTS, COTr, nnUNetv2 (2D), nnUNetv2 (3D fullres), MedNext (2D) and MedNext(3D fullres). Conclusions: We not only proposed a dataset named PSLT(Plain Scan Liver Tumors), but also explored a structure called YNetr that utilizes wavelet transform to extract different frequency information, which having the SOTA in PSLT by experiments.</description>

      <title>Dependability Evaluation of Stable Diffusion with Soft Errors on the Model Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable Diffusion is a popular Transformer-based model for image generation from text; it applies an image information creator to the input text and the visual knowledge is added in a step-by-step fashion to create an image that corresponds to the input text. However, this diffusion process can be corrupted by errors from the underlying hardware, which are especially relevant for implementations at the nanoscales. In this paper, the dependability of Stable Diffusion is studied focusing on soft errors in the memory that stores the model parameters; specifically, errors are injected into some critical layers of the Transformer in different blocks of the image information creator, to evaluate their impact on model performance. The simulations results reveal several conclusions: 1) errors on the down blocks of the creator have a larger impact on the quality of the generated images than those on the up blocks, while the errors on middle block have negligible effect; 2) errors on the self-attention (SA) layers have larger impact on the results than those on the cross-attention (CA) layers; 3) for CA layers, errors on deeper levels result in a larger impact; 4) errors on blocks at the first levels tend to introduce noise in the image, and those on deep layers tend to introduce large colored blocks. These results provide an initial understanding of the impact of errors on Stable Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Flexible Variable-Rate Image Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature compression is a promising direction for coding for machines. Existing methods have made substantial progress, but they require designing and training separate neural network models to meet different specifications of compression rate, performance accuracy and computational complexity. In this paper, a flexible variable-rate feature compression method is presented that can operate on a range of rates by introducing a rate control parameter as an input to the neural network model. By compressing different intermediate features of a pre-trained vision task model, the proposed method can scale the encoding complexity without changing the overall size of the model. The proposed method is more flexible than existing baselines, at the same time outperforming them in terms of the three-way trade-off between feature compression rate, vision task accuracy, and encoding complexity. We have made the source code available at https://github.com/adnan-hossain/var_feat_comp.git.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) poses significant diagnostic challenges in pediatric healthcare, especially in regions like China where it's prevalent. We introduce PneumoniaAPP, a mobile application leveraging deep learning techniques for rapid MPP detection. Our approach capitalizes on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising 3345 chest X-ray (CXR) images, which includes 833 CXR images revealing MPP and additionally augmented with samples from a public dataset. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88.20% and an AUROC of 0.9218 across all classes, with a specific accuracy of 97.64% for the mycoplasma class, as demonstrated on the testing dataset. Furthermore, we integrated explainability techniques into PneumoniaAPP to aid respiratory physicians in lung opacity localization. Our contribution extends beyond existing research by targeting pediatric MPP, emphasizing the age group of 0-12 years, and prioritizing deployment on mobile devices. This work signifies a significant advancement in pediatric pneumonia diagnosis, offering a reliable and accessible tool to alleviate diagnostic burdens in healthcare settings.</description>

Abstract: Generating realistic electron microscopy (EM) images has been a challenging problem due to their complex global and local structures. Isola et al. proposed pix2pix, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), for the general purpose of image-to-image translation; which fails to generate realistic EM images. We propose a new architecture for the discriminator in the GAN providing access to multiple patch sizes using skip patches and generating realistic EM images.</description>

      <title>MugenNet: A Novel Combined Convolution Neural Network and Transformer Network with its Application for Colonic Polyp Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is a very important part in disease diagnosis. The term "colonic polyps" refers to polypoid lesions that occur on the surface of the colonic mucosa within the intestinal lumen. In clinical practice, early detection of polyps is conducted through colonoscopy examinations and biomedical image processing. Therefore, the accurate polyp image segmentation is of great significance in colonoscopy examinations. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a common automatic segmentation method, but its main disadvantage is the long training time. Transformer utilizes a self-attention mechanism, which essentially assigns different importance weights to each piece of information, thus achieving high computational efficiency during segmentation. However, a potential drawback is the risk of information loss. In the study reported in this paper, based on the well-known hybridization principle, we proposed a method to combine CNN and Transformer to retain the strengths of both, and we applied this method to build a system called MugenNet for colonic polyp image segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive experiment to compare MugenNet with other CNN models on five publicly available datasets. The ablation experiment on MugentNet was conducted as well. The experimental results show that MugenNet achieves significantly higher processing speed and accuracy compared with CNN alone. The generalized implication with our work is a method to optimally combine two complimentary methods of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Intensity-based 3D motion correction for cardiac MR images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image acquisition requires subjects to hold their breath while 2D cine images are acquired. This process assumes that the heart remains in the same position across all slices. However, differences in breathhold positions or patient motion introduce 3D slice misalignments. In this work, we propose an algorithm that simultaneously aligns all SA and LA slices by maximizing the pair-wise intensity agreement between their intersections. Unlike previous works, our approach is formulated as a subject-specific optimization problem and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying anatomy. We quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against a large range of rotations and translations by synthetically misaligning 10 motion-free datasets and aligning them back using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Automated HER2 Scoring in Breast Cancer Images Using Deep Learning and Pyramid Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical protein in cancer cell growth that signifies the aggressiveness of breast cancer (BC) and helps predict its prognosis. Accurate assessment of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue slides for HER2 expression levels is essential for both treatment guidance and understanding of cancer mechanisms. Nevertheless, the traditional workflow of manual examination by board-certified pathologists encounters challenges, including inter- and intra-observer inconsistency and extended turnaround times. Here, we introduce a deep learning-based approach utilizing pyramid sampling for the automated classification of HER2 status in IHC-stained BC tissue images. Our approach analyzes morphological features at various spatial scales, efficiently managing the computational load and facilitating a detailed examination of cellular and larger-scale tissue-level details. This method addresses the tissue heterogeneity of HER2 expression by providing a comprehensive view, leading to a blind testing classification accuracy of 84.70%, on a dataset of 523 core images from tissue microarrays. Our automated system, proving reliable as an adjunct pathology tool, has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision and evaluation speed, and might significantly impact cancer treatment planning.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Digital Lithological Mapping-Case Studies in Sri Lanka's Mineral Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional manual lithological mapping (MLM) through field surveys are resource-extensive and time-consuming. Digital lithological mapping (DLM), harnessing remotely sensed spectral imaging techniques, provides an effective strategy to streamline target locations for MLM or an efficient alternative to MLM. DLM relies on laboratory-generated generic end-member signatures of minerals for spectral analysis. Thus, the accuracy of DLM may be limited due to the presence of site-specific impurities. A strategy, based on a hybrid machine-learning and signal-processing algorithm, is proposed in this paper to tackle this problem of site-specific impurities. In addition, a soil pixel alignment strategy is proposed here to visualize the relative purity of the target minerals. The proposed methodologies are validated via case studies for mapping of Limestone deposits in Jaffna, Ilmenite deposits in Pulmoddai and Mannar, and Montmorillonite deposits in Murunkan, Sri Lanka. The results of satellite-based spectral imaging analysis were corroborated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Magnetic Separation (MS) analysis of soil samples collected from those sites via field surveys. There exists a good correspondence between the relative availability of the minerals with the XRD and MS results. In particular, correlation coefficients of 0.8115 and 0.9853 were found for the sites in Pulmoddai and Jaffna respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of adapting CSI-guided imaging across varied environments. Focusing on continuous model learning through continuous updates, we investigate CSI-Imager's adaptability in dynamically changing settings, specifically transitioning from an office to an industrial environment. Unlike traditional approaches that may require retraining for new environments, our experimental study aims to validate the potential of CSI-guided imaging to maintain accurate imaging performance through Continuous Learning (CL). By conducting experiments across different scenarios and settings, this work contributes to understanding the limitations and capabilities of existing CSI-guided imaging systems in adapting to new environmental contexts.</description>

Abstract: Cardiac MRI, crucial for evaluating heart structure and function, faces limitations like slow imaging and motion artifacts. Undersampling reconstruction, especially data-driven algorithms, has emerged as a promising solution to accelerate scans and enhance imaging performance using highly under-sampled data. Nevertheless, the scarcity of publicly available cardiac k-space datasets and evaluation platform hinder the development of data-driven reconstruction algorithms. To address this issue, we organized the Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Challenge (CMRxRecon) in 2023, in collaboration with the 26th International Conference on MICCAI. CMRxRecon presented an extensive k-space dataset comprising cine and mapping raw data, accompanied by detailed annotations of cardiac anatomical structures. With overwhelming participation, the challenge attracted more than 285 teams and over 600 participants. Among them, 22 teams successfully submitted Docker containers for the testing phase, with 7 teams submitted for both cine and mapping tasks. All teams use deep learning based approaches, indicating that deep learning has predominately become a promising solution for the problem. The first-place winner of both tasks utilizes the E2E-VarNet architecture as backbones. In contrast, U-Net is still the most popular backbone for both multi-coil and single-coil reconstructions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, presents a summary of the submitted results, reviews the employed methods, and offers an in-depth discussion that aims to inspire future advancements in cardiac MRI reconstruction models. The summary emphasizes the effective strategies observed in Cardiac MRI reconstruction, including backbone architecture, loss function, pre-processing techniques, physical modeling, and model complexity, thereby providing valuable insights for further developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Diffusion based Zero-shot Medical Image-to-Image Translation for Cross Modality Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modality image segmentation aims to segment the target modalities using a method designed in the source modality. Deep generative models can translate the target modality images into the source modality, thus enabling cross-modality segmentation. However, a vast body of existing cross-modality image translation methods relies on supervised learning. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of zero-shot learning-based image translation tasks (extreme scenarios in the target modality is unseen in the training phase). To leverage generative learning for zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation, we propose a novel unsupervised image translation method. The framework learns to translate the unseen source image to the target modality for image segmentation by leveraging the inherent statistical consistency between different modalities for diffusion guidance. Our framework captures identical cross-modality features in the statistical domain, offering diffusion guidance without relying on direct mappings between the source and target domains. This advantage allows our method to adapt to changing source domains without the need for retraining, making it highly practical when sufficient labeled source domain data is not available. The proposed framework is validated in zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation tasks through empirical comparisons with influential generative models, including adversarial-based and diffusion-based models.</description>

      <title>iMD4GC: Incomplete Multimodal Data Integration to Advance Precise Treatment Response Prediction and Survival Analysis for Gastric Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide, ranking as the fifth most common cancer with over 1 million new cases and 700 thousand deaths in 2020. Locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) accounts for approximately two-thirds of GC diagnoses, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has emerged as the standard treatment for LAGC. However, the effectiveness of NACT varies significantly among patients, with a considerable subset displaying treatment resistance. Ineffective NACT not only leads to adverse effects but also misses the optimal therapeutic window, resulting in lower survival rate. However, existing multimodal learning methods assume the availability of all modalities for each patient, which does not align with the reality of clinical practice. The limited availability of modalities for each patient would cause information loss, adversely affecting predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an incomplete multimodal data integration framework for GC (iMD4GC) to address the challenges posed by incomplete multimodal data, enabling precise response prediction and survival analysis. Specifically, iMD4GC incorporates unimodal attention layers for each modality to capture intra-modal information. Subsequently, the cross-modal interaction layers explore potential inter-modal interactions and capture complementary information across modalities, thereby enabling information compensation for missing modalities. To evaluate iMD4GC, we collected three multimodal datasets for GC study: GastricRes (698 cases) for response prediction, GastricSur (801 cases) for survival analysis, and TCGA-STAD (400 cases) for survival analysis. The scale of our datasets is significantly larger than previous studies. The iMD4GC achieved impressive performance with an 80.2% AUC on GastricRes, 71.4% C-index on GastricSur, and 66.1% C-index on TCGA-STAD, significantly surpassing other compared methods.</description>

      <title>Deployment of Deep Learning Model in Real World Clinical Setting: A Case Study in Obstetric Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid development of AI models in medical image analysis, their validation in real-world clinical settings remains limited. To address this, we introduce a generic framework designed for deploying image-based AI models in such settings. Using this framework, we deployed a trained model for fetal ultrasound standard plane detection, and evaluated it in real-time sessions with both novice and expert users. Feedback from these sessions revealed that while the model offers potential benefits to medical practitioners, the need for navigational guidance was identified as a key area for improvement. These findings underscore the importance of early deployment of AI models in real-world settings, leading to insights that can guide the refinement of the model and system based on actual user feedback.</description>

      <title>AgileFormer: Spatially Agile Transformer UNet for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decades, deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of medical image segmentation tasks. Recently, the introduction of the vision transformer (ViT) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models. There has been a growing focus on ViTs, driven by their excellent performance and scalability. However, we argue that the current design of the vision transformer-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models may not effectively handle the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of objects of interest in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components to the ViT-UNet. This adaptation enables the model to effectively capture features of target objects with diverse appearances. This is achieved by three main components: \textbf{(i)} deformable patch embedding; \textbf{(ii)} spatially dynamic multi-head attention; \textbf{(iii)} deformable positional encoding. These components were integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer. AgileFormer is a spatially agile ViT-UNet designed for medical image segmentation. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}.</description>

      <title>YOLOOC: YOLO-based Open-Class Incremental Object Detection with Novel Class Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of its use in practice, open-world object detection (OWOD) has gotten a lot of attention recently. The challenge is how can a model detect novel classes and then incrementally learn them without forgetting previously known classes. Previous approaches hinge on strongly-supervised or weakly-supervised novel-class data for novel-class detection, which may not apply to real applications. We construct a new benchmark that novel classes are only encountered at the inference stage. And we propose a new OWOD detector YOLOOC, based on the YOLO architecture yet for the Open-Class setup. We introduce label smoothing to prevent the detector from over-confidently mapping novel classes to known classes and to discover novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on our more realistic setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for discovering novel classes in our new benchmark.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Self-Supervised Constraints in Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning, predominantly studied in high-level visual tasks, have been explored in low-level image processing. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised constraint for single image super-resolution, termed SSC-SR. SSC-SR uniquely addresses the divergence in image complexity by employing a dual asymmetric paradigm and a target model updated via exponential moving average to enhance stability. The proposed SSC-SR framework works as a plug-and-play paradigm and can be easily applied to existing SR models. Empirical evaluations reveal that our SSC-SR framework delivers substantial enhancements on a variety of benchmark datasets, achieving an average increase of 0.1 dB over EDSR and 0.06 dB over SwinIR. In addition, extensive ablation studies corroborate the effectiveness of each constituent in our SSC-SR framework. Codes are available at https://github.com/Aitical/SSCSR.</description>

      <title>STBA: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of DNNs for Query-Limited Black-box Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many attack techniques have been proposed to explore the vulnerability of DNNs and further help to improve their robustness. Despite the significant progress made recently, existing black-box attack methods still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the vast number of queries needed to optimize desired perturbations. Besides, the other critical challenge is that adversarial examples built in a noise-adding manner are abnormal and struggle to successfully attack robust models, whose robustness is enhanced by adversarial training against small perturbations. There is no doubt that these two issues mentioned above will significantly increase the risk of exposure and result in a failure to dig deeply into the vulnerability of DNNs. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate DNNs' fragility sufficiently under query-limited settings in a non-additional way. In this paper, we propose the Spatial Transform Black-box Attack (STBA), a novel framework to craft formidable adversarial examples in the query-limited scenario. Specifically, STBA introduces a flow field to the high-frequency part of clean images to generate adversarial examples and adopts the following two processes to enhance their naturalness and significantly improve the query efficiency: a) we apply an estimated flow field to the high-frequency part of clean images to generate adversarial examples instead of introducing external noise to the benign image, and b) we leverage an efficient gradient estimation method based on a batch of samples to optimize such an ideal flow field under query-limited settings. Compared to existing score-based black-box baselines, extensive experiments indicated that STBA could effectively improve the imperceptibility of the adversarial examples and remarkably boost the attack success rate under query-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Diffusion Models for Photoacoustic Tomography Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a rapidly-evolving medical imaging modality that combines optical absorption contrast with ultrasound imaging depth. One challenge in PAT is image reconstruction with inadequate acoustic signals due to limited sensor coverage or due to the density of the transducer array. Such cases call for solving an ill-posed inverse reconstruction problem. In this work, we use score-based diffusion models to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing an image from limited PAT measurements. The proposed approach allows us to incorporate an expressive prior learned by a diffusion model on simulated vessel structures while still being robust to varying transducer sparsity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image devices have been widely applied in many fields, including scientific imaging, recognition of individuals, and remote sensing. As the application of these imaging technologies to autonomous driving and measurement, image noise generated when observation cannot be performed with a sufficient dose has become a major problem. Machine learning denoise technology is expected to be the solver of this problem, but there are the following problems. Here we report, artifacts generated by machine learning denoise in ultra-low dose observation using an in-situ observation video of an electron microscope as an example. And as a method to solve this problem, we propose a method to decompose a time series image into a 2D image of the spatial axis and time to perform machine learning denoise. Our method opens new avenues accurate and stable reconstruction of continuous high-resolution images from low-dose imaging in science, industry, and life.</description>

      <title>Unified, Verifiable Neural Simulators for Electromagnetic Wave Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulators based on neural networks offer a path to orders-of-magnitude faster electromagnetic wave simulations. Existing models, however, only address narrowly tailored classes of problems and only scale to systems of a few dozen degrees of freedom (DoFs). Here, we demonstrate a single, unified model capable of addressing scattering simulations with thousands of DoFs, of any wavelength, any illumination wavefront, and freeform materials, within broad configurable bounds. Based on an attentional multi-conditioning strategy, our method also allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical states, which provides improved generalization with no additional data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability, we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training. Our findings demonstrate a path to universal, verifiably accurate neural surrogates for existing scattering simulators, and our conditioning and training methods are directly applicable to any PDE admitting a time-domain iterative solver.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Optics for Enhancing Protection in Face De-identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern surge in camera usage alongside widespread computer vision technology applications poses significant privacy and security concerns. Current artificial intelligence (AI) technologies aid in recognizing relevant events and assisting in daily tasks in homes, offices, hospitals, etc. The need to access or process personal information for these purposes raises privacy concerns. While software-level solutions like face de-identification provide a good privacy/utility trade-off, they present vulnerabilities to sniffing attacks. In this paper, we propose a hardware-level face de-identification method to solve this vulnerability. Specifically, our approach first learns an optical encoder along with a regression model to obtain a face heatmap while hiding the face identity from the source image. We also propose an anonymization framework that generates a new face using the privacy-preserving image, face heatmap, and a reference face image from a public dataset as input. We validate our approach with extensive simulations and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>GAMA-IR: Global Additive Multidimensional Averaging for Fast Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable success for various image restoration tasks such as denoising and deblurring. The current state-of-the-art networks are relatively deep and utilize (variants of) self attention mechanisms. Those networks are significantly slower than shallow convolutional networks, which however perform worse. In this paper, we introduce an image restoration network that is both fast and yields excellent image quality. The network is designed to minimize the latency and memory consumption when executed on a standard GPU, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. The network is a simple shallow network with an efficient block that implements global additive multidimensional averaging operations. This block can capture global information and enable a large receptive field even when used in shallow networks with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experiments and evaluations on diverse tasks, we demonstrate that our network achieves comparable or even superior results to existing state-of-the-art image restoration networks with less latency. For instance, we exceed the state-of-the-art result on real-world SIDD denoising by 0.11dB, while being 2 to 10 times faster.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Real-World Active Speaker Detection with Multi-Modal Extraction Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual active speaker detection (AV-ASD) aims to identify which visible face is speaking in a scene with one or more persons. Most existing AV-ASD methods prioritize capturing speech-lip correspondence. However, there is a noticeable gap in addressing the challenges from real-world AV-ASD scenarios. Due to the presence of low-quality noisy videos in such cases, AV-ASD systems without a selective listening ability are short of effectively filtering out disruptive voice components from mixed audio inputs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal Speaker Extraction-to-Detection framework named `MuSED', which is pre-trained with audio-visual target speaker extraction to learn the denoising ability, then it is fine-tuned with the AV-ASD task. Meanwhile, to better capture the multi-modal information and deal with real-world problems such as missing modality, MuSED is modelled on the time domain directly and integrates the multi-modal plus-and-minus augmentation strategy. Our experiments demonstrate that MuSED substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art AV-ASD methods and achieves 95.6% mAP on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset, 98.3% AP on the ASW dataset, and 97.9% F1 on the Columbia AV-ASD dataset, respectively. We will publicly release the code in due course.</description>

      <title>AIGCOIQA2024: Perceptual Quality Assessment of AI Generated Omnidirectional Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has attracted widespread attention. Among the AIGC, AI generated omnidirectional images hold significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, hence omnidirectional AIGC techniques have also been widely studied. AI-generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique distortions compared to natural omnidirectional images, however, there is no dedicated Image Quality Assessment (IQA) criteria for assessing them. This study addresses this gap by establishing a large-scale AI generated omnidirectional image IQA database named AIGCOIQA2024 and constructing a comprehensive benchmark. We first generate 300 omnidirectional images based on 5 AIGC models utilizing 25 text prompts. A subjective IQA experiment is conducted subsequently to assess human visual preferences from three perspectives including quality, comfortability, and correspondence. Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art IQA models on our database. The database will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>CMT: Cross Modulation Transformer with Hybrid Loss for Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pansharpening aims to enhance remote sensing image (RSI) quality by merging high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) with multispectral (MS) images. However, prior techniques struggled to optimally fuse PAN and MS images for enhanced spatial and spectral information, due to a lack of a systematic framework capable of effectively coordinating their individual strengths. In response, we present the Cross Modulation Transformer (CMT), a pioneering method that modifies the attention mechanism. This approach utilizes a robust modulation technique from signal processing, integrating it into the attention mechanism's calculations. It dynamically tunes the weights of the carrier's value (V) matrix according to the modulator's features, thus resolving historical challenges and achieving a seamless integration of spatial and spectral attributes. Furthermore, considering that RSI exhibits large-scale features and edge details along with local textures, we crafted a hybrid loss function that combines Fourier and wavelet transforms to effectively capture these characteristics, thereby enhancing both spatial and spectral accuracy in pansharpening. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available to encourage further research.</description>

      <title>CLIPtone: Unsupervised Learning for Text-based Image Tone Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent image tone adjustment (or enhancement) approaches have predominantly adopted supervised learning for learning human-centric perceptual assessment. However, these approaches are constrained by intrinsic challenges of supervised learning. Primarily, the requirement for expertly-curated or retouched images escalates the data acquisition expenses. Moreover, their coverage of target style is confined to stylistic variants inferred from the training data. To surmount the above challenges, we propose an unsupervised learning-based approach for text-based image tone adjustment method, CLIPtone, that extends an existing image enhancement method to accommodate natural language descriptions. Specifically, we design a hyper-network to adaptively modulate the pretrained parameters of the backbone model based on text description. To assess whether the adjusted image aligns with the text description without ground truth image, we utilize CLIP, which is trained on a vast set of language-image pairs and thus encompasses knowledge of human perception. The major advantages of our approach are three fold: (i) minimal data collection expenses, (ii) support for a range of adjustments, and (iii) the ability to handle novel text descriptions unseen in training. Our approach's efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, including a user study.</description>

      <title>Force-EvT: A Closer Look at Robotic Gripper Force Measurement with Event-based Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic grippers are receiving increasing attention in various industries as essential components of robots for interacting and manipulating objects. While significant progress has been made in the past, conventional rigid grippers still have limitations in handling irregular objects and can damage fragile objects. We have shown that soft grippers offer deformability to adapt to a variety of object shapes and maximize object protection. At the same time, dynamic vision sensors (e.g., event-based cameras) are capable of capturing small changes in brightness and streaming them asynchronously as events, unlike RGB cameras, which do not perform well in low-light and fast-moving environments. In this paper, a dynamic-vision-based algorithm is proposed to measure the force applied to the gripper. In particular, we first set up a DVXplorer Lite series event camera to capture twenty-five sets of event data. Second, motivated by the impressive performance of the Vision Transformer (ViT) algorithm in dense image prediction tasks, we propose a new approach that demonstrates the potential for real-time force estimation and meets the requirements of real-world scenarios. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm on a wide range of scenarios and settings, and show that it consistently outperforms recent approaches.</description>

      <title>Noise2Image: Noise-Enabled Static Scene Recovery for Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras capture changes of intensity over time as a stream of 'events' and generally cannot measure intensity itself; hence, they are only used for imaging dynamic scenes. However, fluctuations due to random photon arrival inevitably trigger noise events, even for static scenes. While previous efforts have been focused on filtering out these undesirable noise events to improve signal quality, we find that, in the photon-noise regime, these noise events are correlated with the static scene intensity. We analyze the noise event generation and model its relationship to illuminance. Based on this understanding, we propose a method, called Noise2Image, to leverage the illuminance-dependent noise characteristics to recover the static parts of a scene, which are otherwise invisible to event cameras. We experimentally collect a dataset of noise events on static scenes to train and validate Noise2Image. Our results show that Noise2Image can robustly recover intensity images solely from noise events, providing a novel approach for capturing static scenes in event cameras, without additional hardware.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Classification of Thoracic Diseases using Dense Convolutional Network on Chest Radiographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods of identifying pathologies in X-ray images rely heavily on skilled human interpretation and are often time-consuming. The advent of deep learning techniques has enabled the development of automated disease diagnosis systems. Still, the performance of such systems is opaque to end-users and limited to detecting a single pathology. In this paper, we propose a multi-label disease prediction model that allows the detection of more than one pathology at a given test time. We use a dense convolutional neural network (DenseNet) for disease diagnosis. Our proposed model achieved the highest AUC score of 0.896 for the condition Cardiomegaly with an accuracy of 0.826, while the lowest AUC score was obtained for Nodule, at 0.655 with an accuracy of 0.66. To build trust in decision-making, we generated heatmaps on X-rays to visualize the regions where the model paid attention to make certain predictions. Our proposed automated disease prediction model obtained highly confident high-performance metrics in multi-label disease prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>CECT: Controllable Ensemble CNN and Transformer for COVID-19 Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hundreds of million cases and numerous deaths worldwide. Here, we develop a novel classification network CECT by controllable ensemble convolutional neural network and transformer to provide a timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. The CECT is composed of a parallel convolutional encoder block, an aggregate transposed-convolutional decoder block, and a windowed attention classification block. Each block captures features at different scales from 28 $\times$ 28 to 224 $\times$ 224 from the input, composing enriched and comprehensive information. Different from existing methods, our CECT can capture features at both multi-local and global scales without any sophisticated module design. Moreover, the contribution of local features at different scales can be controlled with the proposed ensemble coefficients. We evaluate CECT on two public COVID-19 datasets and it reaches the highest accuracy of 98.1% in the intra-dataset evaluation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the developed CECT achieves an accuracy of 90.9% on the unseen dataset in the inter-dataset evaluation, showing extraordinary generalization ability. With remarkable feature capture ability and generalization ability, we believe CECT can be extended to other medical scenarios as a powerful diagnosis tool.

      <description>arXiv:2304.12306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical component in clinical practice, facilitating accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization of treatment plans.</description>

      <title>Solving Diffusion ODEs with Optimal Boundary Conditions for Better Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, as a kind of powerful generative model, have given impressive results on image super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, due to the randomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the performances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of sampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent randomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability, making it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results. However, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and leveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling method that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR methods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images from pre-trained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary differential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs) and analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their corresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an approximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The quality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps outperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness from the same pre-trained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our sampling method "boosts" current diffusion-based SR models without any additional training.</description>

Abstract: Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in microscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to specific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyper-parameters in different experimental settings. Here, we present a multi-modality cell segmentation benchmark, comprising over 1500 labeled images derived from more than 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a Transformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing methods but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging platforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark and the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and versatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging.</description>

      <title>Virtual imaging trials improved the transparency and reliability of AI systems in COVID-19 imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The credibility of AI models in medical imaging is often challenged by reproducibility issues and obscured clinical insights, a reality highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic by many reports of near-perfect artificial intelligence (AI) models that all failed to generalize. To address these concerns, we propose a virtual imaging trial framework, employing a diverse collection of medical images that are both clinical and simulated. In this study, COVID-19 serves as a case example to unveil the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing AI performance. Our findings underscore a significant impact of dataset characteristics on AI efficacy. Even when trained on large, diverse clinical datasets with thousands of patients, AI performance plummeted by up to 20% in generalization. However, virtual imaging trials offer a robust platform for objective assessment, unveiling nuanced insights into the relationships between patient- and physics-based factors and AI performance. For instance, disease extent markedly influenced AI efficacy, computed tomography (CT) out-performed chest radiography (CXR), while imaging dose exhibited minimal impact. Using COVID-19 as a case study, this virtual imaging trial study verified that radiology AI models often suffer from a reproducibility crisis. Virtual imaging trials not only offered a solution for objective performance assessment but also extracted several clinical insights. This study illuminates the path for leveraging virtual imaging to augment the reliability, transparency, and clinical relevance of AI in medical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce U-Net v2, a new robust and efficient U-Net variant for medical image segmentation. It aims to augment the infusion of semantic information into low-level features while simultaneously refining high-level features with finer details. For an input image, we begin by extracting multi-level features with a deep neural network encoder. Next, we enhance the feature map of each level by infusing semantic information from higher-level features and integrating finer details from lower-level features through Hadamard product. Our novel skip connections empower features of all the levels with enriched semantic characteristics and intricate details. The improved features are subsequently transmitted to the decoder for further processing and segmentation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any Encoder-Decoder network. We evaluate our method on several public medical image segmentation datasets for skin lesion segmentation and polyp segmentation, and the experimental results demonstrate the segmentation accuracy of our new method over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving memory and computational efficiency.

      <description>arXiv:2312.08255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique with extensive clinical applications in ophthalmology. OCT enables the visualization of the retinal layers, playing a vital role in the early detection and monitoring of retinal diseases. OCT uses the principle of light wave interference to create detailed images of the retinal microstructures, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing ocular conditions. This work presents an open-access OCT dataset (OCTDL) comprising over 2000 OCT images labeled according to disease group and retinal pathology. The dataset consists of OCT records of patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Epiretinal Membrane (ERM), Retinal Artery Occlusion (RAO), Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), and Vitreomacular Interface Disease (VID). The images were acquired with an Optovue Avanti RTVue XR using raster scanning protocols with dynamic scan length and image resolution. Each retinal b-scan was acquired by centering on the fovea and interpreted and cataloged by an experienced retinal specialist. In this work, we applied Deep Learning classification techniques to this new open-access dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in adapting undersampled trajectories in MRI based on training data. In this work, we propose a novel patient-adaptive MRI sampling algorithm based on grouping scans within a training set. Scan-adaptive sampling patterns are optimized together with an image reconstruction network for the training scans. The training optimization alternates between determining the best sampling pattern for each scan (based on a greedy search or iterative coordinate descent (ICD)) and training a reconstructor across the dataset. The eventual scan-adaptive sampling patterns on the training set are used as labels to predict sampling design using nearest neighbor search at test time. The proposed algorithm is applied to the fastMRI knee multicoil dataset and demonstrates improved performance over several baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias or spurious correlations in image backgrounds can impact neural networks, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans Effect) and hampering generalization to real-world data. ISNet, a recently introduced architecture, proposed the optimization of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP, an explanation technique) heatmaps, to mitigate the influence of backgrounds on deep classifiers. However, ISNet's training time scales linearly with the number of classes in an application. Here, we propose reformulated architectures whose training time becomes independent from this number. Additionally, we introduce a concise and model-agnostic LRP implementation. We challenge the proposed architectures using synthetic background bias, and COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, an application that commonly presents background bias. The networks hindered background attention and shortcut learning, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art models on out-of-distribution test datasets. Representing a potentially massive training speed improvement over ISNet, the proposed architectures introduce LRP optimization into a gamut of applications that the original model cannot feasibly handle.</description>

Abstract: Intervertebral disc disease, a prevalent ailment, frequently leads to intermittent or persistent low back pain, and diagnosing and assessing of this disease rely on accurate measurement of vertebral bone and intervertebral disc geometries from lumbar MR images. Deep neural network (DNN) models may assist clinicians with more efficient image segmentation of individual instances (disks and vertebrae) of the lumbar spine in an automated way, which is termed as instance image segmentation. In this work, we proposed SymTC, an innovative lumbar spine MR image segmentation model that combines the strengths of Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, we designed a parallel dual-path architecture to merge CNN layers and Transformer layers, and we integrated a novel position embedding into the self-attention module of Transformer, enhancing the utilization of positional information for more accurate segmentation. To further improves model performance, we introduced a new data augmentation technique to create synthetic yet realistic MR image dataset, named SSMSpine, which is made publicly available. We evaluated our SymTC and the other 15 existing image segmentation models on our private in-house dataset and the public SSMSpine dataset, using two metrics, Dice Similarity Coefficient and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The results show that our SymTC has the best performance for segmenting vertebral bones and intervertebral discs in lumbar spine MR images. The SymTC code and SSMSpine dataset are available at https://github.com/jiasongchen/SymTC.</description>

      <title>Mamba-UNet: UNet-Like Pure Visual Mamba for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent advancements in medical image analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have set significant benchmarks. While the former excels in capturing local features through its convolution operations, the latter achieves remarkable global context understanding by leveraging self-attention mechanisms. However, both architectures exhibit limitations in efficiently modeling long-range dependencies within medical images, which is a critical aspect for precise segmentation. Inspired by the Mamba architecture, known for its proficiency in handling long sequences and global contextual information with enhanced computational efficiency as a State Space Model (SSM), we propose Mamba-UNet, a novel architecture that synergizes the U-Net in medical image segmentation with Mamba's capability. Mamba-UNet adopts a pure Visual Mamba (VMamba)-based encoder-decoder structure, infused with skip connections to preserve spatial information across different scales of the network. This design facilitates a comprehensive feature learning process, capturing intricate details and broader semantic contexts within medical images. We introduce a novel integration mechanism within the VMamba blocks to ensure seamless connectivity and information flow between the encoder and decoder paths, enhancing the segmentation performance. We conducted experiments on publicly available ACDC MRI Cardiac segmentation dataset, and Synapse CT Abdomen segmentation dataset. The results show that Mamba-UNet outperforms several types of UNet in medical image segmentation under the same hyper-parameter setting. The source code and baseline implementations are available.</description>

      <title>Semi-Mamba-UNet: Pixel-Level Contrastive and Pixel-Level Cross-Supervised Visual Mamba-based UNet for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential in diagnostics, treatment planning, and healthcare, with deep learning offering promising advancements. Notably, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) excel in capturing local image features, whereas Vision Transformer (ViT) adeptly model long-range dependencies through multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Despite their strengths, both CNN and ViT face challenges in efficiently processing long-range dependencies within medical images, often requiring substantial computational resources. This issue, combined with the high cost and limited availability of expert annotations, poses significant obstacles to achieving precise segmentation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Semi-Mamba-UNet, which integrates a visual mamba-based UNet architecture with a conventional UNet into a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. This innovative SSL approach leverages dual networks to jointly generate pseudo labels and cross supervise each other, drawing inspiration from consistency regularization techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised pixel-level contrastive learning strategy, employing a projector pair to further enhance feature learning capabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation on a publicly available MRI cardiac segmentation dataset, comparing against various SSL frameworks with different UNet-based segmentation networks, highlights the superior performance of Semi-Mamba-UNet. The source code has been made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Passive Snapshot Coded Aperture Dual-Pixel RGB-D Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive, compact, single-shot 3D sensing is useful in many application areas such as microscopy, medical imaging, surgical navigation, and autonomous driving where form factor, time, and power constraints can exist. Obtaining RGB-D scene information over a short imaging distance, in an ultra-compact form factor, and in a passive, snapshot manner is challenging. Dual-pixel (DP) sensors are a potential solution to achieve the same. DP sensors collect light rays from two different halves of the lens in two interleaved pixel arrays, thus capturing two slightly different views of the scene, like a stereo camera system. However, imaging with a DP sensor implies that the defocus blur size is directly proportional to the disparity seen between the views. This creates a trade-off between disparity estimation vs. deblurring accuracy. To improve this trade-off effect, we propose CADS (Coded Aperture Dual-Pixel Sensing), in which we use a coded aperture in the imaging lens along with a DP sensor. In our approach, we jointly learn an optimal coded pattern and the reconstruction algorithm in an end-to-end optimization setting. Our resulting CADS imaging system demonstrates improvement of &gt;1.5dB PSNR in all-in-focus (AIF) estimates and 5-6% in depth estimation quality over naive DP sensing for a wide range of aperture settings. Furthermore, we build the proposed CADS prototypes for DSLR photography settings and in an endoscope and a dermoscope form factor. Our novel coded dual-pixel sensing approach demonstrates accurate RGB-D reconstruction results in simulations and real-world experiments in a passive, snapshot, and compact manner.</description>

      <title>Modular Blind Video Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays a pivotal role in evaluating and improving the viewing experience of end-users across a wide range of video-based platforms and services. Contemporary deep learning-based models primarily analyze video content in its aggressively subsampled format, while being blind to the impact of the actual spatial resolution and frame rate on video quality. In this paper, we propose a modular BVQA model and a method of training it to improve its modularity. Our model comprises a base quality predictor, a spatial rectifier, and a temporal rectifier, responding to the visual content and distortion, spatial resolution, and frame rate changes on video quality, respectively. During training, spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities to render the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model, which should work better with the rectifiers. Extensive experiments on both professionally-generated content and user-generated content video databases show that our quality model achieves superior or comparable performance to current methods. Additionally, the modularity of our model offers an opportunity to analyze existing video quality databases in terms of their spatial and temporal complexity.</description>

      <title>FocusMAE: Gallbladder Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Videos with Focused Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, automated Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) detection has gained the attention of researchers. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies relying on ultrasound sonography (US) images exhibit limited generalization, emphasizing the need for transformative approaches. We observe that individual US frames may lack sufficient information to capture disease manifestation. This study advocates for a paradigm shift towards video-based GBC detection, leveraging the inherent advantages of spatiotemporal representations. Employing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning, we address shortcomings in conventional image-based methods. We propose a novel design called FocusMAE to systematically bias the selection of masking tokens from high-information regions, fostering a more refined representation of malignancy. Additionally, we contribute the most extensive US video dataset for GBC detection. We also note that, this is the first study on US video-based GBC detection. We validate the proposed methods on the curated dataset, and report a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 96.4% for the GBC detection problem, against an accuracy of 84% by current Image-based SOTA - GBCNet, and RadFormer, and 94.7% by Video-based SOTA - AdaMAE. We further demonstrate the generality of the proposed FocusMAE on a public CT-based Covid detection dataset, reporting an improvement in accuracy by 3.3% over current baselines.

Abstract: Image-to-image translation is a technique that focuses on transferring images from one domain to another while maintaining the essential content representations. In recent years, image-to-image translation has gained significant attention and achieved remarkable advancements due to its diverse applications in computer vision and image processing tasks. In this work, we propose an innovative method for image translation between different domains. For high-resolution image translation tasks, we use a grayscale adjustment method to achieve pixel-level translation. For other tasks, we utilize the Pix2PixHD model with a coarse-to-fine generator, multi-scale discriminator, and improved loss to enhance the image translation performance. On the other hand, to tackle the issue of sparse training data, we adopt model weight initialization from other task to optimize the performance of the current task.</description>

      <title>Rotate to Scan: UNet-like Mamba with Triplet SSM Module for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image segmentation holds a vital position in the realms of diagnosis and treatment within the medical domain. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models have made significant advancements in this realm, but they still encounter challenges because of limited receptive field or high computing complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba and its variants, have demonstrated notable performance in the field of vision. However, their feature extraction methods may not be sufficiently effective and retain some redundant structures, leaving room for parameter reduction. Motivated by previous spatial and channel attention methods, we propose Triplet Mamba-UNet. The method leverages residual VSS Blocks to extract intensive contextual features, while Triplet SSM is employed to fuse features across spatial and channel dimensions. We conducted experiments on ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvasir-Instrument datasets, demonstrating the superior segmentation performance of our proposed TM-UNet. Additionally, compared to the previous VM-UNet, our model achieves a one-third reduction in parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.07655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semantic image segmentation task consists of classifying each pixel of an image into an instance, where each instance corresponds to a class. This task is a part of the concept of scene understanding or better explaining the global context of an image. In the medical image analysis domain, image segmentation can be used for image-guided interventions, radiotherapy, or improved radiological diagnostics. In this review, we categorize the leading deep learning-based medical and non-medical image segmentation solutions into six main groups of deep architectural, data synthesis-based, loss function-based, sequenced models, weakly supervised, and multi-task methods and provide a comprehensive review of the contributions in each of these groups. Further, for each group, we analyze each variant of these groups and discuss the limitations of the current approaches and present potential future research directions for semantic image segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing quality and removing noise during preprocessing is one of the most critical steps in image processing. X-ray images are created by photons colliding with atoms and the variation in scattered noise absorption. This noise leads to a deterioration in the graph's medical quality and, at times, results in repetition, thereby increasing the patient's effective dose. One of the most critical challenges in this area has consistently been lowering the image noise. Techniques like BM3d, low-pass filters, and Autoencoder have taken this step. Owing to their structural design and high rate of repetition, neural networks employing diverse architectures have, over the past decade, achieved noise reduction with satisfactory outcomes, surpassing the traditional BM3D and low-pass filters. The combination of the Hankel matrix with neural networks represents one of these configurations. The Hankel matrix aims to identify a local circle by separating individual values into local and non-local components, utilizing a non-local matrix. A non-local matrix can be created using the wave or DCT. This paper suggests integrating the waveform with the Daubechies (D4) wavelet due to its higher energy concentration and employs the u-Net neural network architecture, which incorporates the waveform exclusively at each stage. The outcomes were evaluated using the PSNR and SSIM criteria, and the outcomes were verified by using various waves. The effectiveness of a one-wave network has increased from 0.5% to 1.2%, according to studies done on other datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Orthogonal Transform-Based Perceptron Layers for Efficient ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a set of transform-based neural network layers as an alternative to the $3\times3$ Conv2D layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed layers can be implemented based on orthogonal transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Hadamard transform (HT), and biorthogonal Block Wavelet Transform (BWT). Furthermore, by taking advantage of the convolution theorems, convolutional filtering operations are performed in the transform domain using element-wise multiplications. Trainable soft-thresholding layers, that remove noise in the transform domain, bring nonlinearity to the transform domain layers. Compared to the Conv2D layer, which is spatial-agnostic and channel-specific, the proposed layers are location-specific and channel-specific. Moreover, these proposed layers reduce the number of parameters and multiplications significantly while improving the accuracy results of regular ResNets on the ImageNet-1K classification task. Furthermore, they can be inserted with a batch normalization layer before the global average pooling layer in the conventional ResNets as an additional layer to improve classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Phonetic Context-Aware Lip-Sync For Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Talking face generation is the challenging task of synthesizing a natural and realistic face that requires accurate synchronization with a given audio. Due to co-articulation, where an isolated phone is influenced by the preceding or following phones, the articulation of a phone varies upon the phonetic context. Therefore, modeling lip motion with the phonetic context can generate more spatio-temporally aligned lip movement. In this respect, we investigate the phonetic context in generating lip motion for talking face generation. We propose Context-Aware Lip-Sync framework (CALS), which explicitly leverages phonetic context to generate lip movement of the target face. CALS is comprised of an Audio-to-Lip module and a Lip-to-Face module. The former is pretrained based on masked learning to map each phone to a contextualized lip motion unit. The contextualized lip motion unit then guides the latter in synthesizing a target identity with context-aware lip motion. From extensive experiments, we verify that simply exploiting the phonetic context in the proposed CALS framework effectively enhances spatio-temporal alignment. We also demonstrate the extent to which the phonetic context assists in lip synchronization and find the effective window size for lip generation to be approximately 1.2 seconds.</description>

      <title>SPIDeRS: Structured Polarization for Invisible Depth and Reflectance Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we capture shape and reflectance in stealth? Such capability would be valuable for many application domains in vision, xR, robotics, and HCI. We introduce structured polarization for invisible depth and reflectance sensing (SPIDeRS), the first depth and reflectance sensing method using patterns of polarized light. The key idea is to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of projected light at each pixel. The use of polarization makes it invisible and lets us recover not only depth but also directly surface normals and even reflectance. We implement SPIDeRS with a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) and a polarimetric camera. We derive a novel method for robustly extracting the projected structured polarization pattern from the polarimetric object appearance. We evaluate the effectiveness of SPIDeRS by applying it to a number of real-world objects. The results show that our method successfully reconstructs object shapes of various materials and is robust to diffuse reflection and ambient light. We also demonstrate relighting using recovered surface normals and reflectance. We believe SPIDeRS opens a new avenue of polarization use in visual sensing.</description>

      <title>Rapid post-disaster infrastructure damage characterisation enabled by remote sensing and deep learning technologies -- a tiered approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure are systematically targeted during wars and extensive natural disasters because critical infrastructure is vital for enabling connectivity and transportation of people and goods, and hence, underpins national and international economic growth. Mass destruction of transport assets, in conjunction with minimal or no accessibility in the wake of natural and anthropogenic disasters, prevents us from delivering rapid recovery and adaptation. A solution to this challenge is to use technology that enables stand-off observations. Nevertheless, no methods exist for the integrated characterisation of damage at multiple scales, i.e. regional, asset, and structural scales, while there is no systematic correlation between infrastructure damage assessments across these scales. We propose a methodology based on an integrated multi-scale tiered approach to fill this capability gap. In doing so, we demonstrate how damage characterisation can be enabled by fit-for-purpose digital technologies. Next, the methodology is applied and validated to a case study in Ukraine that includes 17 bridges all damages by human targeted interventions. From macro to micro, we deploy technology to integrate assessments at scale, using from Sentinel-1 SAR images, crowdsourced information, and high-resolution images to deep learning to characterise infrastructure damage. For the first time, the interferometric coherence difference and semantic segmentation of images were deployed to improve the reliability of damage characterisations at different scales, i.e. regional, infrastructure asset and component, with the aim of enhancing the damage characterisation accuracy. This integrated approach accelerates decision-making, and therefore, facilitates more efficient restoration and adaptation efforts, ultimately fostering resilience into our infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Introducing an ensemble method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease through the analysis of PET scan images</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%.</description>

Abstract: Given the aging highway infrastructure requiring extensive rebuilding and enhancements, and the consequent rise in the number of work zones, there is an urgent need to develop advanced safety systems to protect workers. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant potential for delivering warnings to workers, its integration into roadway work zones remains relatively unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to improve safety measures within roadway work zones by conducting an extensive analysis of how different combinations of multimodal AR warnings influence the reaction times of workers. This paper addresses this gap through a series of experiments that aim to replicate the distinctive conditions of roadway work zones, both in real-world and virtual reality environments. Our approach comprises three key components: an advanced AR system prototype, a VR simulation of AR functionality within the work zone environment, and the Wizard of Oz technique to synchronize user experiences across experiments. To assess reaction times, we leverage both the simple reaction time (SRT) technique and an innovative vision-based metric that utilizes real-time pose estimation. By conducting five experiments in controlled outdoor work zones and indoor VR settings, our study provides valuable information on how various multimodal AR warnings impact workers reaction times. Furthermore, our findings reveal the disparities in reaction times between VR simulations and real-world scenarios, thereby gauging VR's capability to mirror the dynamics of roadway work zones. Furthermore, our results substantiate the potential and reliability of vision-based reaction time measurements. These insights resonate well with those derived using the SRT technique, underscoring the viability of this approach for tangible real-world uses.</description>

      <title>Towards 3D Vision with Low-Cost Single-Photon Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17801</link>

Abstract: We present a method for reconstructing 3D shape of arbitrary Lambertian objects based on measurements by miniature, energy-efficient, low-cost single-photon cameras. These cameras, operating as time resolved image sensors, illuminate the scene with a very fast pulse of diffuse light and record the shape of that pulse as it returns back from the scene at a high temporal resolution. We propose to model this image formation process, account for its non-idealities, and adapt neural rendering to reconstruct 3D geometry from a set of spatially distributed sensors with known poses. We show that our approach can successfully recover complex 3D shapes from simulated data. We further demonstrate 3D object reconstruction from real-world captures, utilizing measurements from a commodity proximity sensor. Our work draws a connection between image-based modeling and active range scanning and is a step towards 3D vision with single-photon cameras.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Fiber Cluster Shape Analysis for Language Performance Cognitive Score Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19001</link>

Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</description>
