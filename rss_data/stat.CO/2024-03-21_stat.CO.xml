      <title>Bayesian inversion with Student's t priors based on Gaussian scale mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inverse problems focus on recovering a quantity of interest that is a priori known to exhibit either discontinuous or smooth behavior. Within the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, such structural information can be encoded using Markov random field priors. Here, we propose a class of priors that combine Markov random field structure with Student's t distribution. This approach offers flexibility in modeling diverse structural behaviors depending on available data. Flexibility is achieved by including the degrees of freedom parameter of Student's t in the formulation of the Bayesian inverse problem. To facilitate posterior computations, we employ Gaussian scale mixture representation for the Student's t Markov random field prior which allows expressing the prior as a conditionally Gaussian distribution depending of auxiliary hyperparameters. Adopting this representation, we can derive most of the posterior conditional distributions in closed form and utilize the Gibbs sampler to explore the posterior. We illustrate the method with two numerical examples: signal deconvolution and image deblurring.</description>

      <title>kDGLM: a R package for Bayesian analysis of Generalized Dynamic Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces kDGLM, an R package designed for Bayesian analysis of Generalized Dynamic Linear Models (GDLM), with a primary focus on both uni- and multivariate exponential families. Emphasizing sequential inference for time series data, the kDGLM package provides comprehensive support for fitting, smoothing, monitoring, and feed-forward interventions. The methodology employed by kDGLM, as proposed in Alves et al. (2024), seamlessly integrates with well-established techniques from the literature, particularly those used in (Gaussian) Dynamic Models. These include discount strategies, autoregressive components, transfer functions, and more. Leveraging key properties of the Kalman filter and smoothing, kDGLM exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, enabling virtually instantaneous fitting times that scale linearly with the length of the time series. This characteristic makes it an exceptionally powerful tool for the analysis of extended time series. For example, when modeling monthly hospital admissions in Brazil due to gastroenteritis from 2010 to 2022, the fitting process took a mere 0.11s. Even in a spatial-time variant of the model (27 outcomes, 110 latent states, and 156 months, yielding 17,160 parameters), the fitting time was only 4.24s. Currently, the kDGLM package supports a range of distributions, including univariate Normal (unknown mean and observational variance), bivariate Normal (unknown means, observational variances, and correlation), Poisson, Gamma (known shape and unknown mean), and Multinomial (known number of trials and unknown event probabilities). Additionally, kDGLM allows the joint modeling of multiple time series, provided each series follows one of the supported distributions. Ongoing efforts aim to continuously expand the supported distributions.</description>

      <title>Training Survival Models using Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival Analysis provides critical insights for partially incomplete time-to-event data in various domains. It is also an important example of probabilistic machine learning. The probabilistic nature of the predictions can be exploited by using (proper) scoring rules in the model fitting process instead of likelihood-based optimization. Our proposal does so in a generic manner and can be used for a variety of model classes. We establish different parametric and non-parametric sub-frameworks that allow different degrees of flexibility. Incorporated into neural networks, it leads to a computationally efficient and scalable optimization routine, yielding state-of-the-art predictive performance. Finally, we show that using our framework, we can recover various parametric models and demonstrate that optimization works equally well when compared to likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Point Estimate Method for Probabilistic Moments Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents in detail the originally developed Quadratic Point Estimate Method (QPEM), aimed at efficiently and accurately computing the first four output moments of probabilistic distributions, using 2n^2+1 sample (or sigma) points, with n, the number of input random variables. The proposed QPEM particularly offers an effective, superior, and practical alternative to existing sampling and quadrature methods for low- and moderately-high-dimensional problems. Detailed theoretical derivations are provided proving that the proposed method can achieve a fifth or higher-order accuracy for symmetric input distributions. Various numerical examples, from simple polynomial functions to nonlinear finite element analyses with random field representations, support the theoretical findings and further showcase the validity, efficiency, and applicability of the QPEM, from low- to high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Antithetic Multilevel Methods for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic Diffusions with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for the estimation of expectations with respect to laws of diffusion processes that can be elliptic or hypo-elliptic. In particular, we consider the case where one has to resort to time discretization of the diffusion and numerical simulation of such schemes. Motivated by recent developments, we introduce a new MLMC estimator of expectations, which does not require simulation of intractable L\'evy areas but has a weak error of order 2 and achieves the optimal computational complexity. We then show how this approach can be used in the context of the filtering problem associated to partially observed diffusions with discrete time observations. We illustrate with numerical simulations that our new approaches provide efficiency gains for several problems relative to some existing methods.</description>

      <title>A class of bootstrap based residuals for compositional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regression models for compositional data are common in several areas of knowledge. As in other classes of regression models, it is desirable to perform diagnostic analysis in these models using residuals that are approximately standard normally distributed. However, for regression models for compositional data, there has not been any multivariate residual that meets this requirement. In this work, we introduce a class of asymptotically standard normally distributed residuals for compositional data based on bootstrap. Monte Carlo simulation studies indicate that the distributions of the residuals of this class are well approximated by the standard normal distribution in small samples. An application to simulated data also suggests that one of the residuals of the proposed class is better to identify model misspecification than its competitors. Finally, the usefulness of the best residual of the proposed class is illustrated through an application on sleep stages. The class of residuals proposed here can also be used in other classes of multivariate regression models.</description>

      <title>An Ordering of Divergences for Variational Inference with Factorized Gaussian Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to compute the best approximation $q$ from some more tractable family $\mathcal{Q}$. Most commonly the approximation is found by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, there exist other valid choices of divergences, and when $\mathcal{Q}$ does not contain~$p$, each divergence champions a different solution. We analyze how the choice of divergence affects the outcome of VI when a Gaussian with a dense covariance matrix is approximated by a Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix. In this setting we show that different divergences can be \textit{ordered} by the amount that their variational approximations misestimate various measures of uncertainty, such as the variance, precision, and entropy. We also derive an impossibility theorem showing that no two of these measures can be simultaneously matched by a factorized approximation; hence, the choice of divergence informs which measure, if any, is correctly estimated. Our analysis covers the KL divergence, the R\'enyi divergences, and a score-based divergence that compares $\nabla\log p$ and $\nabla\log q$. We empirically evaluate whether these orderings hold when VI is used to approximate non-Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Subsampling into Bayesian Models for High-Dimensional Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive spatial statistical models with weakly stationary process assumptions have become standard in spatial statistics. However, one disadvantage of such models is the computation time, which rapidly increases with the number of data points. The goal of this article is to apply an existing subsampling strategy to standard spatial additive models and to derive the spatial statistical properties. We call this strategy the ''spatial data subset model'' (SDSM) approach, which can be applied to big datasets in a computationally feasible way. Our approach has the advantage that one does not require any additional restrictive model assumptions. That is, computational gains increase as model assumptions are removed when using our model framework. This provides one solution to the computational bottlenecks that occur when applying methods such as Kriging to ''big data''. We provide several properties of this new spatial data subset model approach in terms of moments, sill, nugget, and range under several sampling designs. An advantage of our approach is that it subsamples without throwing away data, and can be implemented using datasets of any size that can be stored. We present the results of the spatial data subset model approach on simulated datasets, and on a large dataset consists of 150,000 observations of daytime land surface temperatures measured by the MODIS instrument onboard the Terra satellite.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Gibbs Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. Our approach exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering. We demonstrate that our sampler attains substantially improved results across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.</description>
