      <title>Comparison of different methods for identification of dominant oscillation mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and compares the various techniques for identification and analysis of low frequency oscillations in a power system. Inter-area electromechanical oscillations are the focus of this paper. After multiresolution decomposition of characteristic signals, physical characteristics of system oscillations in signal components are identified and presented using the Fourier transform, Prony method, Matrix Pencil Analysis Method, S-transform, Global Wavelet Spectrum and Hilbert Huang transform (Hilbert Marginal Spectrum) in time-frequency domain representation. The analyses were performed on real frequency signals obtained from FNET GridEye system during the earthquake that triggered the shutdown of the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station in the east coast of the United States. In addition, according to the obtained results the proposed methods have proven to be reliable for identification of the model parameters of low-frequency oscillation in power systems. The relevant analyses are carried out in MATLAB coding environment.</description>

      <title>Damage Mechanics Challenge: Predictions based on the phase field fracture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our contribution to the Purdue-SANDIA-LLNL \emph{Damage Mechanics Challenge}. The phase field fracture model is adopted to blindly estimate the failure characteristics of the challenge test, an unconventional three-point bending experiment on an additively manufactured rock resembling a type of gypsum. The model is formulated in a variationally consistent fashion, incorporating a volumetric-deviatoric strain energy decomposition, and the numerical implementation adopts a monolithic unconditionally stable solution scheme. Our focus is on providing an efficient and simple yet rigorous approach capable of delivering accurate predictions based solely on physical parameters. Model inputs are Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\nu$, toughness $G_c$ and strength $\sigma_c$ (as determined by the choice of phase field length scale $\ell$). We show that a single mode I three-point bending test is sufficient to calibrate the model, and that the calibrated model can then reliably predict the force versus displacement responses, crack paths and surface crack morphologies of more intricate three-point bending experiments that are inherently mixed-mode. Importantly, our peak load, crack trajectory and crack surface morphology predictions for the challenge test, submitted before the experimental data was released, show a remarkable agreement with experiments. The characteristics of the challenge, and how changes in these can impact the predictive abilities of phase field fracture models, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Delaunay Refinement Algorithm for the Particle Finite Element Method applied to Free Surface Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two contributions to the calculation of free surface flows using the particle finite element method (PFEM). The PFEM is based on a Lagrangian approach: a set of particles defines the fluid. Then, unlike a pure Lagrangian method, all the particles are connected by a triangular mesh. The difficulty lies in locating the free surface from this mesh. It is a matter of deciding which of the elements in the mesh are part of the fluid domain, and to define a boundary - the free surface. Then, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved on the fluid domain and the particles' position is updated using the resulting velocity vector. Our first contribution is to propose an approach to adapt the mesh with theoretical guarantees of quality: the mesh generation community has acquired a lot of experience and understanding about mesh adaptation approaches with guarantees of quality on the final mesh. We use here a Delaunay refinement strategy, allowing to insert and remove nodes while gradually improving mesh quality. We show that this allows to create stable and smooth free surface geometries. Our PFEM approach models the topological evolution of one fluid. It is nevertheless necessary to apply conditions on the domain boundaries. When a boundary is a free surface, the flow on the other side is not modelled, it is represented by an external pressure. On the external free surface boundary, atmospheric pressure can be imposed. Nevertheless, there may be internal free surfaces: the fluid can fully encapsulate cavities to form bubbles. The pressure required to maintain the volume of those bubbles is a priori unknown. We propose a multi-point constraint approach to enforce global incompressibility of those empty bubbles. This approach allows to accurately model bubbly flows that involve two fluids with large density differences, while only modelling the heavier fluid.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent physics-informed deep learning material model for short fiber/polymer nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL)-based constitutive model for investigating the viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of short fiber-reinforced nanoparticle-filled epoxies under various ambient conditions. The deep-learning model is trained to enforce thermodynamic principles, leading to a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model. To accomplish this, a long short-term memory network is combined with a feed-forward neural network to predict internal variables required for characterizing the internal dissipation of the nanocomposite materials. In addition, another feed-forward neural network is used to indicate the free-energy function, which enables defining the thermodynamic state of the entire system. The PIDL model is initially developed for the three-dimensional case by generating synthetic data from a classical constitutive model. The model is then trained by extracting the data directly from cyclic loading-unloading experimental tests. Numerical examples show that the PIDL model can accurately predict the mechanical behavior of epoxy-based nanocomposites for different volume fractions of fibers and nanoparticles under various hygrothermal conditions.</description>

      <title>Context, Composition, Automation, and Communication -- The C2AC Roadmap for Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation has become, in many application areas, a sine-qua-non. Most recently, COVID-19 has underlined the importance of simulation studies and limitations in current practices and methods. We identify four goals of methodological work for addressing these limitations. The first is to provide better support for capturing, representing, and evaluating the context of simulation studies, including research questions, assumptions, requirements, and activities contributing to a simulation study. In addition, the composition of simulation models and other simulation studies' products must be supported beyond syntactical coherence, including aspects of semantics and purpose, enabling their effective reuse. A higher degree of automating simulation studies will contribute to more systematic, standardized simulation studies and their efficiency. Finally, it is essential to invest increased effort into effectively communicating results and the processes involved in simulation studies to enable their use in research and decision-making. These goals are not pursued independently of each other, but they will benefit from and sometimes even rely on advances in other subfields. In the present paper, we explore the basis and interdependencies evident in current research and practice and delineate future research directions based on these considerations.</description>

      <title>Input Convex Lipschitz RNN: A Fast and Robust Approach for Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness are critical factors in real-world engineering applications. Yet, conventional neural networks often fall short in addressing both simultaneously, or even separately. Drawing insights from natural physical systems and existing literature, it is known that an input convex architecture enhances computational efficiency, while a Lipschitz-constrained architecture bolsters non-adversarial robustness. By leveraging the strengths of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, we develop a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks. This model is explicitly designed for fast and robust optimization-based tasks and outperforms existing recurrent units across a spectrum of engineering tasks in terms of computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness, including real-world solar irradiance prediction for Solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore and real-time Model Predictive Control optimization for a nonlinear chemical reactor.</description>
