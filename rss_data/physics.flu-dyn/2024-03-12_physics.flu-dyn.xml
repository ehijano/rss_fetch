      <title>Migration of two Interacting Micro-Confined Deformable Drops Under an Imposed Temperature Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tiny drop of one liquid, suspended within another, may be set into motion aligned with an imposed thermal gradient, as influenced by thermocapillary action stemming from the gradients in interfacial tension due to the local variations in temperature. In real-world situations, however, such drops do not remain in isolation, as they interact with their neighbouring entities including other drops in the proximity as well as a nearby solid boundary, setting up a complex interplay between the confinement-mediated interactions and three-dimensional nature of the droplet dynamics. In this study, we present numerical solutions for the migration dynamics of a tightly-confined drop-couple, incorporating deformable interfaces, film flow, and Marangoni effects in the presence of dynamically evolving thermocapillary stresses induced by an imposed uniform temperature gradient. Unlike prior investigations, our work highlights the influence of the confinement towards orchestrating non-trivial features of drop migration, as dictated by an intricate coupling of the thermal and flow fields amidst the interferences of the domain boundaries. The study reveals that hydrodynamic interactions resulting from a juxtaposition of these influences deform the drops in a unique manner as compared to the characteristics evidenced from previously reported studies, causing a distortion of the local thermal fields around them. The consequent alteration in the drop velocities is shown to govern their migration in a distinctive manner, presenting unique signatures as compared to more restrictive scenarios studied previously. These findings hold significance in designing thermocapillary-driven micro-confined systems for controlling drop trajectories under an imposed thermal field, bearing far-reaching implications in a plethora of overarching applications ranging from droplet microfluidics to space technology.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of nonuniformly damped, broad-banded waves: applications to waves in sea-ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper sets out to explore the modulational (or Benjamin-Feir) instability of a monochromatic wave propagating in the presence of damping such as that induced by sea-ice on the ocean surface. The fundamental wave motion is modelled using the spatial Zakharov equation, to which either uniform or non-uniform (frequency dependent) damping is added. By means of mode truncation the spatial analogue of the classical Benjamin-Feir instability can be studied analytically using dynamical systems techniques. The formulation readily yields the free surface envelope, giving insight into the physical implications of damping on the modulational instability. The evolution of an initially unstable mode is also studied numerically by integrating the damped, spatial Zakharov equation, in order to complement the analytical theory. This sheds light on the effects of damping on spectral broadening arising from this instability.</description>

      <title>Study of parameters affecting the cooling capacity of liquid jets by using OpenFoam as tool to solve the inverse heat transfer problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, some of the parameters influencing the cooling capacity of a liquid jet impinging onto Inconel 718 and C45 plates were experimentally investigated. The experiment included a high-speed camera to record the dynamic of the jet during the cooling process while an infrared camera was used to record the temperature field at the opposite surface. Jets made of water and oil-in-water emulsion were analysed as well as the influence of the oil concentration. Other parameters studied here include initial temperature of the plate, nozzle-to-plate distance, nozzle diameter, jet velocity, and impinging angle. The cooling performance was analysed by solving a full 3D inverse heat transfer problem (IHTP) with the Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) implemented in a new solver in OpenFoam. The basic organization and implementation of the solver is shown, followed by its validation with a made-up case. Finally, the growth of the wetting front was analysed for different oil concentrations and a combination of nozzle diameters and jet velocities for the same flow rate. For the latest, unexpected results emerged when comparing the wetting growth for the two plate materials.</description>

      <title>Turbulent mixed convection in vertical and horizontal channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent shear flows driven by a combination of a pressure gradient and buoyancy forcing are investigated using direct numerical simulations. Specifically, we consider the setup of a differentially heated vertical channel subject to a Poiseuille-like horizontal pressure gradient. We explore the response of the system to its three control parameters: the Grashof number $Gr$, the Prandtl number $Pr$, and the Reynolds number $Re$ of the pressure-driven flow. From these input parameters, the relative strength of buoyancy driving to the pressure gradient can be quantified by the Richardson number $Ri=Gr/Re^2$. We compare the response of the mixed vertical convection configuration to that of mixed Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and find a nearly identical behaviour, including an increase in wall friction at higher $Gr$ and a drop in the heat flux relative to natural convection for $Ri=O(1)$. This closely matched response is despite vastly different flow structures in the systems. No large-scale organisation is visible in visualisations of mixed vertical convection - an observation that is quantitatively confirmed by spectral analysis. This analysis, combined with a statistical description of the wall heat flux, highlights how moderate shear suppresses the growth of small-scale plumes and reduces the likelihood of extreme events in the local wall heat flux. Vice versa, starting from a pure shear flow, the addition of thermal driving enhances the drag due to the emission of thermal plumes.</description>

      <title>On disintegration of lean hydrogen flames in narrow gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disintegration of near limit flames propagating through the gap of Hele-Shaw cells has recently become a subject of active research. In this paper, the flamelets resulting from the disintegration of the continuous front are interpreted in terms of the Zeldovich flame-balls stabilized by volumetric heat losses. A complicated free-boundary problem for 2D self-drifting near circular flamelets is reduced to a 1D model. The 1D formulation is then utilized to obtain the locus of the flamelet velocity, size, heat losses and Lewis numbers at which the self-drifting flamelets may exist.</description>

      <title>Programming droplet motion using metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion control of droplets has generated much attention for its applications to microfluidics, where precise control of small fluid volumes is an imperative requirement. Mechanical vibrations have been shown to be effective at inducing controllable depinning, and activation of different drop motion regimes. However, existing vibration-based strategies involve establishing homogeneous rigid-body dynamics on the substrate, and therefore lack any form of spatial heterogeneity and tuning. Addressing this limitation, metamaterials provide an ideal platform to achieve spectrally and spatially selective drop motion control, which leverages their ability to attenuate vibrations in selected frequency bands and in selected regions of a substrate. In this work, we illustrate the potential of metamaterials-based drop control by experimentally demonstrating a variety of drop motion capabilities on the surface of metaplates endowed with locally resonant stubs. The experiments leverage the design versatility of a LEGO component-enabled reconfigurable design platform and laser vibrometry measurements with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Heating from Above in Non-scattering Suspensions: Phototactic Bioconvection under Collimated Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining phototactic bioconvection in non-scattering suspensions with upper heating and collimated irradiation, this study delves into the intricate dynamics influenced by light and microorganisms. The study focuses on the linear stability of the basic state, examining neutral curves. The numerical analysis involves solving a system of equations using the MATLAB bvp4c solver. The investigation considers the impact of parameters, such as the thermal Rayleigh number, critical total intensity, and Lewis number, on the critical bioconvection Rayleigh number. As the critical total intensity varies, a transition from a stationary to an oscillatory solution (and vice versa) is observed. Phototactic microorganisms are incorporated into the model, and results show how varying parameters affect convection patterns and stability. The findings reveal interesting phenomena, including Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles.</description>

      <title>A multilayer shallow water model for polydisperse reactive sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional model of polydisperse reactive sedimentation is developed by means of a multilayer shallow water approach. The model consists of a variety of solid particles of different sizes and densities, and substrates diluted in water, which produce biochemical reactions while the sedimentation process occurs. Based on the Masliyah-Lockett-Bassoon settling velocity, compressibility of the sediment and viscosity of the mixture, the system of governing equations is composed by non-homogeneous transport equations, coupled to a momentum equation describing the mass-average velocity. Besides, the free-surface depicted by the total height of the fluid column is incorporated and fully determined through the multilayer approach. A finite volume numerical scheme on Cartesian grids is proposed to approximate the model equations. Numerical simulations of the denitrification process exemplify the performance of the numerical scheme and model under different scenarios and bottom topographies.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Slowing of Stellar Differential Rotation by Instability-Driven Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich--Schubert--Fricke (GSF) instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing angular momentum gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat, and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or ``parasitic saturation" models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.</description>

Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to rational and soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of long waves through regions of irregular floating ice and bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing theoretical results for attenuation of surface waves propagating on water of random fluctuating depth are shown to over predict the rate of decay due to the way in which ensemble averaging is performed. A revised approach is presented which corrects this and is shown to conserve energy. New theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results which use averaging of simulations of wave scattering over finite sections of random bathymetry for which transfer matrix eigenvalues are used to accurately measure decay. The model of wave propagation used in this paper is derived from a linearised long wavelength assumption whereby depth averaging leads to time harmonic waves being represented as solutions to a simple ordinary differential equation. In this paper it is shown how this can be adapted to incorporate a model of a continuous covering of the surface by fragmented floating ice. Attenuation of waves through broken ice of random thickness is then analysed in a similar manner as bed variations previously and some comparisons are made with published field data for attenuation of waves in the marginal ice zones. Key features of the data are reproduced by theory including the attenuation being proportional to a power of frequency between 2 and 4 as well as capturing the "roll-over effect" at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>The impact of finite span and wing-tip vortices on a turbulent NACA0012 wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are conducted to investigate the turbulent boundary layers around a finite-span NACA0012 wing with a rounded wing-tip geometry at a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re_c=200\,000$ and at various angles of attack up to $10^\circ$. The study aims to discern the differences between the boundary layers on the finite-span wing and those on infinite-span wings at equivalent angles of attack. The finite-span boundary layers exhibit: (i) an altered streamwise and a non-zero spanwise pressure gradient as a result of the variable downwash induced by the wing-tip vortices (an inviscid effect typical of finite-span wings); (ii) differences in the flow history at different wall-normal distances, caused by the variable flow angle in the wall-normal direction (due to constant pressure gradients and variable momentum normal to the wall); (iii) laminar flow entrainment into the turbulent boundary layers near the wing tip (due to a laminar/turbulent interface); and (iv) variations in boundary layer thickness across the span, attributed to the variable wall-normal velocity in that direction (a primarily inviscid effect). These physical effects are then used to explain the differences in the Reynolds stress profiles and other boundary layer quantities, including the reduced near-wall peak of the streamwise Reynolds stress and the elevated Reynolds stress levels near the boundary layer edge, both observed in the finite-span wings. Other aspects of the flow, such as the downstream development of wing-tip vortices and their interactions with the surrounding flow, are reserved for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Advances in the kinetics of heat and mass transfer in near-continuous complex flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of macro continuous flow has a long history. Simultaneously, the exploration of heat and mass transfer in small systems with a particle number of several hundred or less has gained significant interest in the fields of statistical physics and nonlinear science. However, due to absence of suitable methods, the understanding of mesoscale behavior situated between the aforementioned two scenarios, which challenges the physical function of traditional continuous fluid theory and exceeds the simulation capability of microscopic molecular dynamics method, remains considerably deficient. This greatly restricts the evaluation of effects of mesoscale behavior and impedes the development of corresponding regulation techniques. To access the mesoscale behaviors, there are two ways: from large to small and from small to large. Given the necessity to interface with the prevailing macroscopic continuous modeling currently used in the mechanical engineering community, our study of mesoscale behavior begins from the side closer to the macroscopic continuum, that is from large to small. Focusing on some fundamental challenges encountered in modeling and analysis of near-continuous flows, we review the research progress of discrete Boltzmann method (DBM). The ideas and schemes of DBM in coarse-grained modeling and complex physical field analysis are introduced. The relationships, particularly the differences, between DBM and traditional fluid modeling as well as other kinetic methods are discussed. After verification and validation of the method, some applied researches including the development of various physical functions associated with discrete and non-equilibrium effects are illustrated. Future directions of DBM related studies are indicated.</description>

      <title>Topological Signature of Stratospheric Poincare -- Gravity Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotation of the earth breaks time-reversal and reflection symmetries in an opposite sense north and south of the equator, leading to a topological origin for certain atmospheric and oceanic equatorial waves. Away from the equator the rotating shallow water and stably stratified primitive equations exhibit Poincare inertio-gravity waves that have nontrivial topology as evidenced by their strict superinertial timescale and a phase singularity in frequency-wavevector space. This non-trivial topology then predicts, via the principle of bulk-interface correspondence, the existence of two equatorial waves along the equatorial interface, the Kelvin and Yanai waves. To directly test the nontrivial topology of Poincare-gravity waves in observations, we examine ERA5 reanalysis data and study cross-correlations between the wind velocity and geopotential height of the mid-latitude stratosphere at the 50 hPa height. We find the predicted vortex and anti-vortex in the relative phase of the geopotential height and velocity at the high frequencies of the waves. By contrast, lower-frequency planetary waves are found to have trivial topology also as expected from theory. These results demonstrate a new way to understand stratospheric waves, and provide a new qualitative tool for the investigation of waves in other components of the climate system.</description>
