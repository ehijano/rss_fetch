      <title>Satisficing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a $\textit{satisficing equilibrium}$ each agent plays one of their $k$ best pure actions, but not necessarily their best action. We show that satisficing equilibria in which agents play only their best or second-best action exist in almost all games. In fact, in almost all games, there exist satisficing equilibria in which all but one agent best-respond and the remaining agent plays at least a second-best action. By contrast, more than one third of games possess no pure Nash equilibrium. In addition to providing static foundations for satisficing equilibria, we show that a parsimonious dynamic converges to satisficing equilibria in almost all games. We apply our results to market design and show that a mediator who can control a single agent can enforce stability in most games. Finally, we use our results to study the existence of $\epsilon$-equilibria.</description>

      <title>On Mechanism Underlying Algorithmic Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two issues of algorithmic collusion are addressed in this paper. First, we show that in a general class of symmetric games, including Prisoner's Dilemma, Bertrand competition, and any (nonlinear) mixture of first and second price auction, only (strict) Nash Equilibrium (NE) is stochastically stable. Therefore, the tacit collusion is driven by failure to learn NE due to insufficient learning, instead of learning some strategies to sustain collusive outcomes. Second, we study how algorithms adapt to collusion in real simulations with insufficient learning. Extensive explorations in early stages and discount factors inflates the Q-value, which interrupts the sequential and alternative price undercut and leads to bilateral rebound. The process is iterated, making the price curves like Edgeworth cycles. When both exploration rate and Q-value decrease, algorithms may bilaterally rebound to relatively high common price level by coincidence, and then get stuck. Finally, we accommodate our reasoning to simulation outcomes in the literature, including optimistic initialization, market design and algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Optimal allocations with capacity constrained verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal has $m$ identical objects to allocate among a group of $n$ agents. Objects are desirable and the principal's value of assigning an object to an agent is the agent's private information. The principal can verify up to $k$ agents, where $k&lt;m$, thereby perfectly learning the types of those verified. We find the mechanism that maximizes the principal's expected utility when no monetary transfers are available. In this mechanism, an agent receives an object if (i) his type is above a cutoff and among the $m$ highest types, (ii) his type is above some lower cutoff but among the $k$ highest types, or (iii) he receives an object in a lottery that allocates the remaining objects randomly.</description>

      <title>Objective Weights for Scoring: The Automatic Democratic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When comparing performance (of products, services, entities, etc.), multiple attributes are involved. This paper deals with a way of weighting these attributes when one is seeking an overall score. It presents an objective approach to generating the weights in a scoring formula which avoids personal judgement. The first step is to find the maximum possible score for each assessed entity. These upper bound scores are found using Data Envelopment Analysis. In the second step the weights in the scoring formula are found by regressing the unique DEA scores on the attribute data. Reasons for using least squares and avoiding other distance measures are given. The method is tested on data where the true scores and weights are known. The method enables the construction of an objective scoring formula which has been generated from the data arising from all assessed entities and is, in that sense, democratic.</description>

      <title>Should the Timing of Inspections be Predictable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A principal hires an agent to work on a long-term project that culminates in a breakthrough or a breakdown. At each time, the agent privately chooses to work or shirk. Working increases the arrival rate of breakthroughs and decreases the arrival rate of breakdowns. To motivate the agent to work, the principal conducts costly inspections. She fires the agent if shirking is detected. We characterize the principal's optimal inspection policy. Predictable inspections are optimal if work primarily generates breakthroughs. Random inspections are optimal if work primarily prevents breakdowns. Crucially, the agent's actions determine his risk attitude over the timing of punishments.</description>

      <title>Harmful choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the choice behavior of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing some distortion of her true preference, in which the first $i$ alternatives are moved to the bottom, in a reversed order. The deterministic declination of our pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM in her decision. We analyze irrational choices that display the lowest degree of self-punishment, and a characterization of them is provided. Moreover, we characterize the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that it comprises almost all choices. We also characterize stochastic self-punishment, which collects all the Random Utility Models (RUMs) whose support is restricted to the harmful distortions of some preference. Full identification of the DM's preference and randomization over its harmful distortions is allowed if each alternative is selected from the ground set with probability greater than zero. Finally, the degree of self-punishment of harmful stochastic choices is characterized.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. Many decisions require a qualified majority: the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution, based on the Shapley-Shubik index, and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The level of decisiveness decreases if the population criterion is above 68\% or the states criterion is at least 17. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley-Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable in evaluating any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>
