      <title>Diffuse Scattering from Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of inhomegeneity in determining the properties of correlated electron systems is poorly understood because of the dearth of structural probes of disorder at the nanoscale. Advances in both neutron and x-ray scattering instrumentation now allow comprehensive measurements of diffuse scattering in single crystals over large volumes of reciprocal space, enabling structural correlations to be characterized over a range of length scales from 10~{\AA} to 200~{\AA} or more. When combined with new analysis tools, such as three-dimensional difference pair-distribution functions, these advanced capabilities have produced novel insights into the interplay of structural fluctuations and electronic properties in a broad range of correlated electron materials. This review describes recent investigations that have demonstrated the importance of understanding structural inhomogeneity pertaining to phenomena as diverse as superconductivity, charge-density-wave modulations, metal-insulator transitions, and multipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Novel electronic state of honeycomb iridate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.</description>

      <title>Exchange striction induced thermal Hall effect in van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as an ideal probe for investigating topological phenomena of charge-neutral excitation. Notably, it reveals crucial aspects of spin-lattice couplings that have been difficult to access for decades. However, the exchange striction mechanism from a lattice-induced change in exchange interaction has often been ignored in thermal Hall experiments. MnPS3 can offer a platform to study exchange striction on the thermal Hall effect due to its significant spin-lattice coupling and field-induced non-collinear spin configuration. Our thermal transport data show distinct temperature and field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{xx}$) and thermal Hall effect ($\kappa_{xy}$). By using detailed theoretical calculation, we found that the inclusion of the exchange striction is essential for a better description of both $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xy}$. Our result demonstrates the importance of the exchange striction mechanism for a complete understanding of the magnon-phonon-driven thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects on Coupled Electronic and Structural Properties of Doped Rare-Earth Trihydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth trihydrides ($R$H$_3$) exhibit intriguing coupled electronic and structural properties as a function of doping, hydrogen vacancies, and thermodynamic conditions. Theoretical studies of these materials typically rely on density functional theory (DFT), including the use of small supercells that may underestimate strong correlation effects and structural distortions which in turn may influence their metallicity. Here, we elucidate the roles of lattice distortions and correlation effects on the electronic properties of pristine and doped $R$H$_3$ by adopting DFT+U and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Linear-response constrained DFT (LR-cDFT) methods find Hubbard U $\approx 2$ eV for $R_d$ orbitals and U$\approx 6$ eV for H$_s$/N$_p$ orbitals. The small U on Lu$_d$ orbitals is consistent with QMC calculations on LuH$_3$ and LuH$_{2.875}$N$_{0.125}$. In pure face-centered-cubic (FCC) $R$H$_3$ ($R$=Lu,Y), neither DFT nor DFT+U with the self-consistently determined U is enough to create a band gap, however a supercell with hydrogen distortions creates a small gap whose magnitude increases when performing DFT+U with self-consistently determined U values. Correlation effects, in turn, have a moderate influence on the coupled structural and electronic properties of doped RH$_3$ compounds and may be important when considering the competition between structural distortions and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spacetime symmetry indicators for two-dimensional Floquet topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet Topological Insulators (FTIs) in two spatial dimensions can exhibit anomalous chiral edge modes despite a fully localized bulk, captured by a new topological invariant other than the Chern number. In this work, we focus on (2 + 1)D FTIs in symmetry class A with a spacetime symmetry known as n-fold time screw symmetry. We show that the bulk invariant can be partially determined by symmetry indicators associated with n = 2, 3, 4, 6 time screw symmetry, which only depend on the time evolution in high symmetry momenta. We derive simple formula that relates symmetry indicators to the bulk invariant, and demonstrate its validity in examples of FTI models. Our results can simplify the engineering of FTIs in real materials, and especially shed light on systems driven by circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology rings for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <title>Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Driving the Berry phase anomalous Hall effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet by domain manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in antiferromagnets presents an intriguing phenomenon with potential spintronic device applications due to their ultrafast switching dynamics. Mn3NiN antiperovskite stands out as a promising candidate owing to its noncollinear antiferromagnetism. In this study, we report a significant AHE observed in epitaxial Mn3NiN thin films below the N\'eel temperature, comparable to those observed in typical ferromagnets. Through a combination of magnetometry, neutron diffraction and ab-initio data analyses, we propose that the substantial AHE can be attributed to the non-vanishing Berry curvature arising from the {\Gamma}4g-type spin structure, coupled with uncompensated magnetic domains featuring a weak canted moment. This coupling, due to robust antiferromagnetic domains, enables deterministic detection and switching of AHE via the application of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear ferrielectricity and hydrogen-induced ferromagnetic polar half-metallicity in MnO$_3$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collinear dipole orders such as ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity have developed rapidly in last decades. While, the noncollinear dipole orders are rarely touched in solids. Noncollinear dipole orders can provide a route to realize ferrielectricity. Based on first-principles calculations, an inorganic molecular crystal MnO$_3$Cl has been demonstrated to own intrinsic noncollinear ferrielectricity, which originates from the stereo orientations of polar molecules. The large negative piezoelectricity effect ($d_{33}\sim-27$ pC/N) is also predicted. A strong light absorption and moderate optical anisotropy are found for this molecular crystal in the ultraviolet light window. Additionally, by electron doping via hydrogen intercalation, a ferromagnetic polar half-metals can be obtained. Our study here provide a material platform to explore the intriguing physics of noncollinear ferrielectricity and potential applications in devices.</description>

      <title>Boosting the transparency of metallic SrNbO3 through Ti doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various materials have been developed to reduce the reliance of industries on Indium, a primary component of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) used in the current generation of devices. The leading candidates for indium free TCOs are strontium vanadates, niobates and molybdates -- strongly correlated perovskite systems that exhibit high intrinsic electrical conductivity and optimal transparency. In this work, we focus on the strontium niobate thin films and manipulate its optical conductivity by Ti doping, which shifts the plasma frequency and reduces electronic correlations. This allows us to achieve a low resistance for Ti doped SNO thin films, while maintaining a high transparency in the visible spectrum. We obtain the optimal figure-of-merit (FOM) of 10.3 ($10^{-3}\Omega^{-1}$) for $x = 0.3$. This FOM significantly outperforms the optoelectronic capabilities of Tin-doped Indium oxide (ITO) and several other proposed transparent conductor materials. Our research paves the way for designing the next generation of transparent conductors, guided by insights from density-functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).</description>

      <title>Characterizing the chemical potential disorder in the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy under ultra-high vacuum and down to 1.7 K to study the local variations of the chemical potential on the surface of the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films (thickness 7 - 30 nm) with varying Sb-concentration $x$, to gain insight into the charge puddles formed in thin films of a compensated topological insulator. We found that the amplitude of the potential fluctuations, $\Gamma$, is between 5 to 14 meV for quasi-bulk conducting films and about 30 - 40 meV for bulk-insulating films. The length scale of the fluctuations, $\lambda$, was found to span the range of 13 - 54 nm, with no clear correlation with $\Gamma$. Applying a magnetic field normal to the surface, we observe the condensation of the two-dimensional topological surface state into Landau levels and find a weak but positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and the spectral width of the Landau-level peaks, which suggests that quantum smearing from drift motion is the source of the Landau level broadening. Our systematic measurements give useful guidelines for realizing $(\mathrm{Bi}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_x)_2\mathrm{Te}_3$ thin films with an acceptable level of potential fluctuations. In particular, we found that $x\approx 0.65$ realizes the situation where $\Gamma$ shows a comparatively small value of 14 meV and the Dirac point lies within $\sim$10 meV of the Fermi energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave phase of the system below critical temperature depends on the ratio of two interactions in such a way that all three of the cyclic, ferromagnetic, and real phases are realized when a weak inversion-breaking term is included.</description>

      <title>Tensorized orbitals for computational chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choosing a basis set is the first step of a quantum chemistry calculation and it sets its maximum accuracy. This choice of orbitals is limited by strong technical constraints as one must be able to compute a large number of six dimensional Coulomb integrals from these orbitals. Here we use tensor network techniques to construct representations of orbitals that essentially lift these technical constraints. We show that a large class of orbitals can be put into ``tensorized'' form including the Gaussian orbitals, Slater orbitals, linear combination thereof as well as new orbitals beyond the above. Our method provides a path for building more accurate and more compact basis sets beyond what has been accessible with previous technology. As an illustration, we construct optimized tensorized orbitals and obtain a 85\% reduction of the error on the energy of the $H_2$ molecules with respect to a reference double zeta calculation (cc-pvDz) of the same size.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model of Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced tunable Kondo effect in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single sheets of graphene, vacancy-induced states have been shown to host an effective spin-1/2 hole that can be Kondo-screened at low temperatures. Here, we show how these vacancy-induced impurity states survive in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), which thus provides a tunable system to probe the critical destruction of the Kondo effect in pseudogap hosts. Ab-initio calculations and atomic-scale modeling are used to determine the nature of the vacancy states in the vicinity of the magic angle in TBG, demonstrating that the vacancy can be treated as a quantum impurity. Utilizing this insight, we construct an Anderson impurity model with a TBG host that we solve using the numerical renormalization group combined with the kernel polynomial method. We determine the phase diagram of the model and show how there is a strict dichotomy between vacancies in the AA/BB versus AB/BA tunneling regions. In AB/BA vacancies, the Kondo temperature at the magic angle develops a broad distribution with a tail to vanishing temperatures due to multifractal wavefunctions at the magic angle. We argue that scanning tunneling microscopy in the vicinity of the vacancy can act as a probe of both the critical single-particle states and the underlying many-body ground state in magic-angle TBG.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experimentally measurable dynamic response functions. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features, if any, are present \textit{a priori}, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum amongst a set obtained with different spectral parameterizations and imposed constraints. We demonstrate the power of this method with examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of model selection, can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <title>Coincidence detection probability of $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of strongly correlated electrons, one of the challenging core tasks is to develop the potential techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons. The $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique has been developed to investigate the two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons. In this article, we will focus on this technique for the correlated electrons near the Fermi energy in condensed matter. The coincidence detection probability of the two emitted electrons in the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission measurement is shown to be relevant to a two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function, which describes the dynamical two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons near the Fermi energy. As the coincidence detection probability involves an electron-electron interaction matrix element, the arbitrary momentum and/or energy transfer due to this electron-electron interaction makes the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique fail to reveal the inner-pair structures of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function. However, the center-of-mass momentum and energy of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function can be distinctly resolved. Thus, the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique can provide the center-of-mass physics of the two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons. It will be one potential technique to study the center-of-mass physics of the Cooper pairs in superconductor.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state fixed points of non-Hermitian transfer matrices</title>

Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary MPS calculation.</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>

Abstract: Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>Triple-top-gate technique for studying the strongly interacting 2D electron systems in heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a technique that dramatically reduces the contact resistances and depletes a shunting channel between the contacts outside the Hall bar in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. It involves the creation of three overlapping independent gates deposited on top of the structure and allows transport measurements to be performed at millikelvin temperatures in the strongly interacting limit at low electron densities, where the energy of the electron-electron interactions dominates all other energy scales. This design allows one to observe the two-threshold voltage-current characteristics that are a signature for the collective depinning and sliding of the electron solid.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>
