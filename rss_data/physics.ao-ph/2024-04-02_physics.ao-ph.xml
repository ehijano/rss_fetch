      <title>Aardvark Weather: end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is revolutionising medium-range weather prediction. However it has only been applied to specific and individual components of the weather prediction pipeline. Consequently these data-driven approaches are unable to be deployed without input from conventional operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, which is computationally costly and does not support end-to-end optimisation. In this work, we take a radically different approach and replace the entire NWP pipeline with a machine learning model. We present Aardvark Weather, the first end-to-end data-driven forecasting system which takes raw observations as input and provides both global and local forecasts. These global forecasts are produced for 24 variables at multiple pressure levels at one-degree spatial resolution and 24 hour temporal resolution, and are skillful with respect to hourly climatology at five to seven day lead times. Local forecasts are produced for temperature, mean sea level pressure, and wind speed at a geographically diverse set of weather stations, and are skillful with respect to an IFS-HRES interpolation baseline at multiple lead-times. Aardvark, by virtue of its simplicity and scalability, opens the door to a new paradigm for performing accurate and efficient data-driven medium-range weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Predictability of climate anomalies in the regions of Northern Eurasia in the spring-summer months in 2024 in connection with El Nino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictability of climate anomalies in the regions of Northern Eurasia in connection with El Nino phenomena is analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the most likely transition in 2024 from an El Nino phase at the beginning of the year to a La Nina phase at the end of the year, with the greatest probability of high temperatures and dry conditions in European Russia during the spring and summer months, as in 2010. The predictability levels of regional climate anomalies using different El Nino indices are compared. The relationship of the noted seasonal anomalies with atmospheric blockings is considered, taking into account the different phases of the key modes of climate variability like El Nino phenomena and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Changes in the predictability of regional climate anomalies under global climate change are discussed.</description>

      <title>Causal dependencies and Shannon entropy budget -- Analysis of a reduced order atmospheric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information entropy budget and the rate of information transfer between variables is studied in the context of a nonlinear reduced-order atmospheric model. The key ingredients of the dynamics are present in this model, namely the baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, the instability related to the presence of an orography, the dissipation related to the surface friction, and the large-scale meridional imbalance of energy. For the parameter chosen, the solutions of this system display a chaotic dynamics reminiscent of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics in the extra-tropics. The detailed information entropy budget analysis of this system reveals that the linear rotation terms plays a minor role in the generation of uncertainties as compared to the orography and the surface friction. Additionally, the dominant contribution comes from the nonlinear advection terms, and their decomposition in synergetic (co-variability) and single (impact of each single variable on the target one) components reveals that for some variables the co-variability dominates the information transfer. The estimation of the rate of information transfer based on time series is also discussed, and an extension of the Liang's approach to nonlinear observables, is proposed.</description>

      <title>One Stone, Two Birds: Using Vapor Kinetic Energy to Detect and Understand Atmospheric Rivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poleward water vapor transport in the midlatitudes mainly occurs in meandering filaments of intense water vapor transport, spanning thousands of kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide and drifting eastward. The water vapor filaments are known as atmospheric rivers (ARs). They can cause extreme wind gusts, intense precipitation, and flooding along densely populated coastal regions. Many recent studies about ARs focused on the statistical analyses of ARs, but a process-level understanding of ARs remains elusive. Here we show that ARs are streams of air with enhanced vapor kinetic energy (VKE) and derive a governing equation for Integrated VKE (IVKE) to understand what contributes to the evolution of ARs. We find that ARs grow mainly because of potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, decay largely owing to condensation and turbulence, and the eastward drift is primarily due to horizontal advection of VKE. Our VKE framework complements the integrated vapor transport framework, which is popular for identifying ARs but lacks a prognostic equation for understanding the physical processes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site based on the ocean wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microseismic motion, which is the ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves such as seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded to explain the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is the microseismic forecast and its example is also shown.</description>
