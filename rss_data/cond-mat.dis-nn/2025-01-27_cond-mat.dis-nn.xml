      <title>Impact of Nonreciprocal Hopping on Localization in Non-Hermitian Quasiperiodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model, incorporating complex phase modulation, unmodulated and modulated nonreciprocal hopping. Using Avila's global theory, we derive analytical phase boundaries and map out the phase diagrams, revealing extended, localized, critical, and skin phases unique to non-Hermitian systems. For complex phase modulation, we determine localization lengths through Lyapunov exponents and show that topological transitions align with localization transitions. In the nonreciprocal case, we use similarity transformations to confirm phase boundaries consistent with Avila's theory and uncover asymmetric localization behaviors. Importantly, modulated nonreciprocal hopping transforms both extended and critical phases into skin phases under open boundary conditions. These results highlight the interplay between topology, localization, and non-Hermitian effects, offering new perspectives on quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating topological in-gap states in non-Hermitian quasicrystal with unconventional $p$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of onsite quasiperiodic potential, superconductivity, and non-Hermiticity is explored in a non-Hermitian unconventional superconducting quasicrystal described by Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (NHAAH) model with $p$-wave pairing. In previous studies, the non-Hermiticity was only considered at the onsite quasiperiodic potential of the NHAAH model, and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) were observed under open boundary conditions (OBC) in this model. In this work, we study an NHAAH model with $p$-wave pairing, where non-Hermiticity is considered onsite by introducing complex quasiperiodic potential and asymmetry at the hopping part. Our analysis uncovers triple-phase transitions, where topological, metal-insulator, and unconventional real-to-complex transitions coincide at weak $p$-wave pairing strength. Additionally, instead of the MZMs observed in the symmetric hopping case, we observe the emergence of in-gap states under OBC in this model. These in-gap states are robust against disorder, underscoring their topological protection. Therefore, unlike the MZMs, which are very challenging to experimentally realize, these in-gap states can be used in topological quantum computational protocols.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Efficiently charting the space of mixed vacancy-ordered perovskites by machine-learning encoded atomic-site information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) are promising alternatives to three-dimensional lead halide perovskites for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Mixing these materials creates a vast compositional space, allowing for highly tunable electronic and optical properties. However, the extensive chemical landscape poses significant challenges in efficiently screening candidates with target properties. In this study, we illustrate the diversity of electronic and optical characteristics as well as the nonlinear mixing effects on electronic structures within mixed VODPs. For mixed systems with limited local environment options, the information regarding atomic-site occupation in-principle determines both structural configurations and all essential properties. Building upon this concept, we have developed a model that integrates a data-augmentation scheme with a transformer-inspired graph neural network (GNN), which encodes atomic-site information from mixed systems. This approach enables us to accurately predict band gaps and formation energies for test samples, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 21 meV and 3.9 meV/atom, respectively. Trained with datasets that include (up to) ternary mixed systems and supercells with less than 72 atoms, our model can be generalized to medium- and high-entropy mixed VODPs (with 4 to 6 principal mixing elements) and large supercells containing more than 200 atoms. Furthermore, our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed bandgap bowing in Sn-based mixed VODPs and reveals an unconventional mixing effect that can result in smaller band gaps compared to those found in pristine systems.</description>
