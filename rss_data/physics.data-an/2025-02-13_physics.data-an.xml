      <title>Simultaneous kinetic profile and magnetic equilibrium inference with Bayesian integrated data analysis in preparation for ITER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate plasma state reconstruction will be crucial for the success of ITER and future fusion plants, but the harsh conditions of a burning plasma will make diagnostic operation more challenging than in current machines. Integrated data analysis (IDA) based on Bayesian inference allows for improved information gain by combining the analysis of many diagnostics into a single step using sophisticated forward models. It also provides a framework to seamlessly combine predictive modeling and data, which can be invaluable in a data-poor environment. As a step towards integrated data analysis at scale, we present a new, fast integrated analysis framework that allows for the simultaneous reconstruction of the kinetic profiles and the magnetic equilibrium with statistically relevant uncertainties included. This analysis framework allows for the systematic evaluation of models using extensive experimental data leveraging DOE supercomputing infrastructure, such as being developed through the DOE-ASCR Integrated Research Infrastructure (Smith, XLOOP). To test the performance and verify the code it was applied to an ITER-like scenario using a realistic machine geometry and diagnostic description. Using artificial data for magnetics, Thomson scattering, interferometry, and polarimetry generated from a known ground truth, the coupled equilibrium and kinetic profile reconstruction problem was solved via the Maximum a posteriori method in approximately three minutes on a multicore CPU including uncertainty quantification. The resulting equilibrium and kinetic profiles were found to be in reasonable agreement with the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and, more in general, to predict how its statistical properties change as a possibly time-dependent perturbation is applied. Recently discovered general forms of the celebrated Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem allow for expressing response operators as correlation functions of suitably defined observables in the unperturbed state, also when such a state is far from equilibrium. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieved enhanced practical applicability, response theory must be interpretable, capable of focusing of relevant timescales, and amenable to implemented by data-driven approaches that are potentially equation-agnostic. Complex systems typically exhibit a hierarchy of temporal behaviors, and unresolved or undesired timescales can obscure the dominant mechanisms driving macroscopic responses. As an element of this desired framework, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we propose here a comprehensive analysis of the linear and nonlinear response of Markov chains to general time-dependent perturbations. We obtain simple and easily implementable formulas that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as higher-order correlations of the system. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if we do not know the underlying evolution equations. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allow to elucidate the role of different time scales and find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Bring the noise: exact inference from noisy simulations in collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rely on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to interpret searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere. These simulations result in noisy and approximate estimators of selection efficiencies and likelihoods. In this context we pioneer an exact-approximate computational method - exact-approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo - that returns exact inferences despite noisy simulations. To do so, we introduce an unbiased estimator for a Poisson likelihood. We demonstrate the new estimator and new techniques in examples based on a search for neutralinos and charginos at the LHC using a simplified model. We find attractive performance characteristics - exact inferences are obtained for a similar computational cost to approximate ones from existing methods and inferences are robust with respect to the number of events generated per point.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and predictive method for atom detection in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect the individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezer arrays. Using simulated images, we demonstrate a ten-fold reduction of the detection error rate compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution, under a wide range of experimental conditions. The runtime is fully compatible with real-time applications, even for a very large arrays. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of an image, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate, which opens new prospect for the design of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Statistically validated projection of bipartite signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems, describing the mechanisms that drive interactions between distinct groups of nodes. Of particular interest are two-mode networks whose edges admit a sign: examples are provided by human interactions with entities such as products, where agents either cast either a positive or negative vote or abstain from voting at all. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is devising a way to obtain a monopartite projection onto the layer of interest that preserves the information encoded into the original structure as much as possible. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. More precisely, we propose two variants of it, according to the way ambivalent patterns and missing ties are treated. Since assessing the statistical significance of any two nodes similarity requires a proper benchmark, here we consider four different Exponential Random Graphs, defined by global as well as local constraints, either leaving the topology free or keeping the topology fixed. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, are detected.</description>

      <title>Learning Selection Cuts With Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many analyses in high-energy physics rely on selection thresholds (cuts) applied to detector, particle, or event properties. Initial cut values can often be guessed from physical intuition, but cut optimization, especially for multiple features, is commonly performed by hand, or skipped entirely in favor of multivariate algorithms like BDTs or classification networks. We revisit this problem, and develop a cut optimization approach based on gradient descent. Cut thresholds are learned as parameters of a network with a simple architecture, and can be tuned to achieve a target signal efficiency through the use of custom loss functions. Contractive terms in the loss can be used to ensure a smooth evolution of cuts as functions of efficiency, particle kinematics, or event features. The method is used to classify events in a search for Supersymmetry, and the performance is compared with traditional classification networks. An implementation of this approach is available in a public code repository and python package.</description>
