      <title>Collective flavor conversions are interactions of neutrinos with quantized flavor waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

      <title>All axion dark matter from supersymmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models accompanied by certain anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries Z_n^R are attractive in that 1. the R-symmetry (which can arise from compactified string theory as a remnant of the broken 10-d Lorentz symmetry) forbids unwanted superpotential terms while allowing for the generation of an accidental, approximate global U(1)_{PQ} symmetry needed to solve the strong CP problem and 2. they provide a raison d'etre for an otherwise ad-hoc R-parity conservation. We augment the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by two additional Z_n^R- and PQ-charged fields X and Y wherein SUSY breaking at an intermediate scale m_{hidden} leads to PQ breaking at a scale f_a\sim 10^{11} GeV leading to a SUSY DFSZ axion. The same SUSY breaking can trigger R-parity breaking via higher-dimensional operators leading to tiny R-violating couplings of order (f_a/m_P)^N and a WIMP quality problem. For Z_4^R and Z_8^R, we find only an N=1 suppression. Then the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) of the MSSM becomes unstable with a lifetime of order ~ 10^{-3}-10 seconds so the LSPs all decay away before the present epoch. That leaves a universe with all axion cold dark matter and no WIMPs in accord with recent LZ-2024 WIMP search results.</description>

      <title>Conformal Freeze-in Dark Matter: 5D Dual and Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Freeze-in (COFI) scenario postulates a dark sector described by a conformal field theory (CFT) at energies above the ``gap scale" in the keV$-$MeV range. At the gap scale, the dark CFT undergoes confinement, and one of the resulting bound states is identified as the dark matter candidate. In this paper, we study this model in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence with a focus on the mechanism of the infrared (IR) breaking of conformal invariance in the dark sector. We construct the holographic dual to the conformal dark sector, given by a Randall-Sundrum-like model in 5D, where the Standard Model (SM) fields and the dark matter candidate are placed on the ultraviolet (UV) and IR branes respectively. The separation between the UV and IR branes is stabilized by a bulk scalar field, naturally generating a hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the gap scale. We find that the parameter space of COFI comprises two distinct branches of CFT's living on the Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) boundary, each corresponding to a different UV boundary condition. The two branches of CFT's result in different radion potentials. The confinement of the CFT is dual to the spontaneous symmetry breaking by the 5D radion potential. We then use this dual 5D setup to study the cosmological confining phase transition in the dark sector. We find the viable parameter space of the theory which allows the phase transition to complete promptly without significant supercooling.</description>

      <title>Constraining the SMEFT Extended with Sterile Neutrinos at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how extensions of the Standard Model (SM) involving heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can be probed at FCC-ee, the proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ collider. Using the effective field theory (EFT) approach, we determine the impact of new interactions on the production and decay of HNLs at FCC-ee. In particular, we consider $d\leq 7$ $\nu$SMEFT operators which induce vector, scalar and tensor four-fermion and effective charged- and neutral-current interactions of HNLs, that may also mix with the active neutrinos of the SM. We consider sensitivities to the active-sterile mixing and EFT Wilson coefficients from monophoton searches and displaced vertex decay signatures. In both analyses, we consider the scenarios where HNLs are Majorana or Dirac fermions. We translate the upper bounds on the Wilson coefficients to lower limits on the scale of new physics and examine the implications for tree-level ultraviolet completions.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <title>Collider Prospects for the Neutrino Magnetic Moment Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition magnetic moment between active and sterile neutrinos is theoretically well-motivated scenario beyond the Standard Model, which can be probed in cosmology, astrophysics, and at terrestrial experiments. In this work, we focus on the latter by examining such an interaction at proposed lepton colliders. Specifically, in addition to revisiting LEP, we consider CEPC, FCC-ee, CLIC, and the muon collider, motivated by the potential realization of any of them. Within the effective field theory framework, we present parameter regions that can be probed, highlighting the dependence on the lepton flavor interacting with the sterile neutrino. By including several new processes with large sterile neutrino production cross sections at high-energy lepton colliders, we find that the expected sensitivity for the active-to-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment can reach $d_\gamma \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Berends-Giele recursion for gluons in arbitrary dimensions over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a proof of concept for the computation of pure gluonic amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The implementation relies on the Berends-Giele recursion algorithm and, for the first time on a GPU, enables the numerical computation of amplitudes in an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions and over finite fields. This demonstrates the advantages of hardware acceleration, not only for the computation of tree-level amplitudes for real-radiation processes in four dimensions over complex numbers but also for generating loop integrands for virtual corrections in $d$ dimensions over finite fields. The associated computer program is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Wigner-like Parametrization of Canonical Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Wigner parametrization of unitary matrices and then apply it to the full description of canonical seesaw models, which extend the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrino singlets and account simultaneously for tiny Majorana neutrino masses and the baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. In the Wigner parametrization, the strong hierarchy between the electroweak scale $\Lambda^{}_{\rm EW} \approx 10^2~{\rm GeV}$ and the seesaw scale $\Lambda^{}_{\rm SS} \approx 10^{14}~{\rm GeV}$ is generally captured by three small rotation angles $\{\vartheta^{}_1, \vartheta^{}_2, \vartheta^{}_3\} \approx {\cal O}(\Lambda^{}_{\rm EW}/\Lambda^{}_{\rm SS})$, and all the remaining parameters reside in four $3\times 3$ unitary matrices. The connection between the Wigner parametrization and those in the literature is also established.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $B_{l4}$ decays provide an independent determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element$\vert V_{ub} \vert$, a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors is a key ingredient to do that. We present a comprehensive QCD study of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors from the light-cone sum rules approach by introducing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2\pi$DAs), in which the twist three distribution amplitudes are defined and its contributions are calculated as the first time. With the partial decaying fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ decay measured recently by Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 3.93^{+0.45}_{-0.47}\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.51\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ in the predominated region of $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ determined from $B \to \rho l \nu$, in comparing to the "golden" channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, is induced by the finite width and nonresonant effects. We look to the future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays which would help us to reduce the uncertainties by improving our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the $2\pi$DAs via the heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Neutralino dark matter in gauge mediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of neutralino dark matter within the framework of gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. In our models, the lightest neutralino, as the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), is a viable dark matter candidate, assuming a gravitino mass of $\mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{TeV}$. The models are formulated in five-dimensional space-time, where the SUSY breaking field and the matter fields are placed on separate branes to avoid issues related to flavor and CP violation. Four distinct neutralino dark matter scenarios are studied: bino-wino coannihilation, higgsino dark matter, wino dark matter, and entropy-diluted bino dark matter. For each case, we determine the allowed parameter spaces and evaluate their consistency with existing experimental limits. Additionally, we examine the potential for testing these models through future investigations at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and through dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>One-loop matching for leading-twist generalised transverse-momentum-dependent distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the one-loop matching coefficients necessary to match all of the leading-twist generalised transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs) onto generalised parton distributions (GPDs). Matching functions are extracted by computing the first radiative corrections to partonic bilocal correlators with staple-like Wilson lines, as appropriate for high-energy collisions. These correlators are characterised by a transverse displacement and skewed kinematics of external states. Using the proton helicity basis, they are parametrised in terms of GTMDs, which are subsequently related to leading-twist GPDs. Our results provide new insights into the complex dynamics of GTMDs generated by radiative corrections. In particular, we show that time-reversal even and odd contributions to GTMDs in the so-called ERBL region mix both under matching and evolution. Finally, we present a selection of numerical results and comment on the quantitative behaviour of GTMDs.</description>

      <title>Testing spooky action between free-traveling electron-positron pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. While the entanglement of confined electron pairs has been established early on, the entanglement of free-traveling electron pairs, particularly at high energies, remains largely unexplored due to the substantial challenges involved in measuring the spins of free-traveling electrons. In this study, we investigate the entanglement and the Bell inequality violation of free-traveling electron-positron pairs generated in a fixed-target experiment. This experimental setup facilitates the creation of a controllable source of entangled electron-positron pairs, where entangled events are produced in specific phase spaces. Based on this source and the prior knowledge of the entangled state, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the polarization correlations of the entangled $e^+e^-$ pairs through their individual secondary scatterings off two separate additional targets.</description>

      <title>Fock state probability changes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are powerful effective descriptions of quantum systems interacting with their environments. Studying changes of Fock states probabilities can be intricate in this context since the prevailing description of open quantum dynamics is by master equations of the systems' reduced density matrices, which usually requires finding solutions for a set of complicated coupled differential equations. In this article, we show that such problems can be circumvented by employing a recently developed path integral-based method for directly computing reduced density matrices in scalar quantum field theory. For this purpose, we consider a real scalar field $\phi$ as an open system interacting via a $\lambda \chi^2\phi^2$-term with an environment comprising another real scalar field $\chi$ that has a finite temperature. In particular, we investigate how the probabilities for observing the vacuum or two-particle states change over time if there were initial correlations of these Fock states. Subsequently, we apply our resulting expressions to a neutrino toy model. We show that, within our model, lighter neutrino masses would lead to a stronger distortion of the observable number of particles due to the interaction with the environment after the initial production process.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 3. Constraints from Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06931v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06940v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>QED nuclear medium effects at EIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) nuclear medium effects under the experimental conditions of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) experiments. Our work offers numerical estimates, particularly in the context of inclusive deep inelastic scattering on a $^{208}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$ nucleus. While prior studies have predominantly focused on elastic scattering, our investigation extends to the more complex scenarios of inelastic processes within a nuclear medium. Our findings suggest that the cross-section corrections due to QED nuclear medium effects could be substantial, reaching or exceeding the level of experimental precision. This work further compares the effects of single re-scattering events with those of multiple re-scatterings, as particles travel the nuclear volume. We estimate the dominant source of the uncertainties associated with our formalism by varying the scale of the atomic physics where the screening of the electric field of the nucleus happens. This calculation not only contributes to the understanding of QED nuclear medium effects, but also offers a path to a more precise extraction of the process-independent non-perturbative structure of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Thermal Dissipation in Lithium-Ion Battery Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective thermal management is critical for lithium-ion battery packs' safe and efficient operations, particularly in applications such as drones, where compact designs and varying airflow conditions present unique challenges. This study investigates the thermal performance of a 16-cell lithium-ion battery pack by optimizing cooling airflow configurations and integrating phase change materials (PCMs) for enhanced heat dissipation. Seven geometric configurations were evaluated under airflow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s, reflecting the operational conditions of civilian drones. A comprehensive 3D simulation approach was used to analyze the effects of inlet and outlet configurations, airflow dynamics, and PCM phase transition behavior. Results indicate that the trapezoidal (wide-base) configuration, paired with a 5-inlet and 1-outlet setup, achieves the most balanced performance, effectively maintaining optimal operating temperatures across low and high-speed airflow conditions. PCM integration further stabilized thermal behavior, with phase change durations extending to 12.5 min under tested conditions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization and material integration in advancing compact and reliable thermal management systems for energy-dense battery packs. This study provides a foundation for designing efficient cooling strategies tailored to lightweight applications such as drones and portable energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>QCD Anderson transition with overlap valence quarks on a twisted-mass sea -- an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD Anderson transition by studying the low-lying eigenmodes of the overlap operator in the background of gauge configurations with 2+1+1 quark flavors of twisted-mass Wilson fermions. The mobility edge, below which eigenmodes are localized, is estimated by the inflection point of the relative volume. The analysis of its temperature dependence suggests a close relation of localization to chiral symmetry restoration. We update our previous work [1] by including recent results on lower temperatures and switching to improved estimates of the lattice spacing and pseudocritical temperature respectively pion mass. Contrary to the previous prediction, our the mobility edge estimate does not vanish at the temperature of the chiral phase transition. We discuss a possible scenario, supported by literature, for why this could be the case.

      <title>Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics, providing remarkable success in describing a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. However, several challenges underscore the urgent need to explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole singularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three broad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or parity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of GR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for understanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address critical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include their potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe, the nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR predictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified gravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era by focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

      <title>Low-energy $DD$ scattering in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of single-channel $DD$ scattering with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1(0^+)$ and $0(1^-)$. The calculation is performed on the $2+1$ flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles with a lattice spacing $a\simeq 0.077$ fm and two different pion masses, $m_{\pi}\simeq207$ and $305$ MeV. The scattering parameters are determined using the L\"uscher's finite volume method. Our results indicate weak repulsive interaction in the $1(0^+)$ channel and slightly attractive interaction in the $0(1^-)$ channel. The $S$-wave isovector $DD$ scattering length and effective range, extrapolated to the physical pion mass, are $(-0.26\pm0.05)$ fm and $(-5.5\pm2.1)$ fm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>Neutron structure function via a maximum entropy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.01387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the maximum entropy method to extract the valence quark distributions of the neutron at a low scale, \( Q_0^2 \). At this initial scale, the neutron is defined to contain only three valence quarks, with no contributions from sea quarks or gluons. The distributions of these initial valence quarks are constrained by principles from quark models, quark-hadron duality, and quark confinement. Employing the DGLAP equations supplemented by parton-parton recombination corrections, we derive the neutron structure function \( F_2^{\rm n} \) at higher scales \( Q^2 \). The resulting ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \), aligns well with world data from deep inelastic scattering (DIS) on proton and deuteron targets, particularly when accounting for uncertainties from model-dependent corrections. Notably, this ratio is in agreement with the JLab MARATHON dataset, especially as \( x \) approaches 1. Additionally, our findings for \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \) correspond well with the JLab BONuS experimental results after considering the impact of nucleon resonance contamination in the region \( x \gtrsim 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 \). We further compare our predictions for \( F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p} \) and the \( u/d \) ratios in the limit as \( x \rightarrow 1 \) with existing theoretical calculations. Finally, we observe a minor violation of isospin symmetry between the proton and neutron, evidenced by the differences in valence quark distributions and the first-order moments of these distributions.</description>

      <title>Polarization Signals from Axion-Photon Resonant Conversion in Neutron Star Magnetosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide ideal astrophysical laboratories for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. If axions exist, photons can develop linear polarization during photon-axion conversion in the magnetic field of a neutron star. We find that the plasma in the neutron star magnetosphere could dramatically enhance the polarization through the resonant conversion effect. With the polarization measurements from PSR B0656+14, 4U 0142+61, and the benchmark polarization measurement in the mid-infrared band, we demonstrate that optical and infrared polarization from neutron stars can provide strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling over a broad axion mass range $10^{-11}\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-3}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Wide Binary Evaporation by Dark Solitons: Implications from the GAIA Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytic calculation is given for binary star evaporation under the tidal perturbation from randomly distributed, spatially extended dark objects. In particular, the Milky Way's wide binary star population is susceptible to such disruption from dark matter solitons of comparable and larger sizes. We identify high-probability `halo-like' wide binaries in GAIA EDR3 with separations larger than 0.1 parsec. Survival of the farthest-separated candidates will provide a novel gravitational probe to dark matter in the form of solitons. In the case of dilute axion-like boson stars, the observational sensitivity extends into the axion mass range $m_a \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-15}$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological first-order chiral phase transition of QCD, and for the first time calculate its parameters which can fully determine the gravitational wave spectrum. With the state-of-the-art calculation from the functional QCD method, we found that the large chemical potential of QCD phase transition results in very weak and fast first-order phase transitions at the temperature lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ MeV. These results further suggest that the GW signals of NANOGrav are very unlikely sourced from the chiral phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the reduced cross section in momentum-space approach utilizing the Block-Durand-Ha (BDH) parameterization of the proton structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ and the leading-order (LO) longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$, proposed by Boroun and Ha [G.R. Boroun and P.Ha, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 109} (2024) 094037] using Laplace transform techniques. Our results are compared with the HERA data and extended to the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) domain. We also examine the ratio $F_{L2}(x, Q^2)=F_{L}(x, Q^2)/F_{2}(x, Q^2)$ obtained from our work, comparing it with both the H1 data and the color dipole (CDP) bounds. We find that our results for the reduced cross section and the ratio $F_{L2}(x, Q^2)$ agree with the H1 data. Finally, our evaluation of the gluon distribution functions $G(x,Q^2)$ in momentum-space approach shows very good concordance with the NNPDF3.0LO gluon structure functions for moderate $Q^2$ in the range $10^{-5}{\leq}x{\leq}1$.</description>

      <title>A Simple Parametrisation of the Pion Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a novel and simple parametrisation of the pion vector form factor that transparently connects spacelike and timelike regions of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Our parametrisation employs the framework of conformal mapping and respects the known analyticity properties of the form factor, accounting explicitly for the $\rho(770)$-meson pole. The parametrisation manifestly fulfils the normalisation condition at $q^2 = 0$ as well as further restrictions at the pion production threshold and in the limit $|q^2| \to \infty$. In contrast to the widely used Omn\`es parametrisation, our approach does not use the pion-pion scattering phase shift as input. We confront the parametrisation with experimental data from $\pi H$ scattering and $\tau^- \to \pi^-\pi^0\nu$ decay. We already find a good description of the data with only five free parameters, which include the pole mass and decay width of the $\rho(770)$.</description>

Abstract: We explain the difference between the measured decay widths of $b \to c \tau \nu$ processes and of $B\to K\nu\bar{\nu}$ and their values predicted in the Standard Model by introducing the right-handed interactions both to quarks and to leptons. At low energy scales, in addition to the Standard Model particles, we assume the presence of an additional neutral lepton (right-handed neutrino). We then show a specific realization of such a scenario in a model with a single scalar leptoquark ($S_1$), and discuss the corresponding phenomenology.</description>

Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Unveiling E$_6$SSM Scalar Diquarks at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of scalar diquarks with sub-TeV masses within the framework of the $E_6$ Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the lightest of the six diquarks predicted by the model, we select some representative low masses for them in a parameter space region consistent with experimental constraints from direct searches for additional Higgs boson(s), Cold Dark Matter (CDM), and supersymmetry, as well as from flavor physics analyses. Using Monte Carlo ($MC$) simulations, we assess these benchmark points against the latest LHC results corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. We further evaluate the signal significance of the pair-production of these diquarks, when each of them decays into $tb$ pairs, at the $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV LHC Run 3 with design integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, and also at the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Our analysis yields a statistical significance exceeding $3\sigma$ at the HL-LHC for diquark masses up to 1 TeV, indicating promising prospects for their discovery.</description>

      <title>Strangeness in the proton from W+charm production and SIDIS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton, including new $W$+charm production data from $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which have been suggested for constraining the strange quark PDF. In particular, we assess the impact of the $W$+charm data relative to that of semi-inclusive pion and kaon production data in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering. Compared with a baseline global fit that does not include these datasets, we find that semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and $W$+charm data combined favor a larger strange distribution, but smaller than the SU(3) symmetric sea suggested in some previous analyses. Combined, the ratio of strange to nonstrange sea quark distributions is $R_s = (s+\bar s)/(\bar u+\bar d) \approx \{ 0.69,\, 0.49,\, 0.29 \}$ for $x = \{ 0.01,\, 0.04,\, 0.1 \}$.</description>

Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Local form factor subtraction for three-loop QCD corrections to electroweak production in quark-antiquark annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a local subtraction framework to three-loop QCD corrections for the production of multiple electroweak bosons in quark-antiquark annihilation. We derive two-loop Ward identities that ensure the factorisation of most collinear singularities from the hard-scattering process in the sum over integrands. Infrared and ultraviolet singularities are removed point-by-point in loop momentum space using a minimal set of counterterms, which can be integrated analytically in terms of known master integrals. Additional counterterms eliminate non-factorising terms arising from loop momentum shifts and one-loop corrections to the gluon three-point function. We identify previously unknown non-factorising loop polarisation effects in the single-collinear regions, which pose challenges for local integrability and require further investigation. The techniques presented here are a first crucial step in formulating a systematic approach for constructing finite integrands for general electroweak amplitudes at three-loop order.</description>

      <title>Type-II Seesaw Mechanism for Dirac Neutrinos and its Implications on $N_{\text{eff}}$ and Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type II seesaw is a popular mechanism for generating Majorana neutrino masses at the right scale, with well-known implications for Lepton Flavor Violation. In a non-abelian extension of the Standard Model featuring a Z' field, the type-II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrino masses naturally arises by imposing lepton number conservation and adding a soft-term breaking a $Z_2$ symmetry of the model. As expected, there are interesting outcomes for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, but we noticed that the number of relativistic neutrinos, $N_{\text{eff}}$, has a greater impact driven by processes involving the $Z'$ boson and right-handed neutrinos. The presence of a gauge symmetry behind the physical processes, allows us to explore an interesting interplay between the type II seesaw, lepton flavor violation and $N_{\text{eff}}$. We find that using the indicated value by Planck $N_{\text{eff}}=2.99^{0.34}_{0.33}$ we impose constraints on the masses of the doubly charged scalar and Z' fields which are complementarity to direct searches at colliders.</description>

Abstract: We present preliminary results of a partial-wave analysis of $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ using data from the Belle experiment at the KEKB $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collider. We validate our model with a model-independent analysis. We see the $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and a G-parity-violating $1^-[\omega(782)\pi]_\mathrm{P}$ wave in tauon decays. Our results will improve models used in simulation studies necessary for measuring the electric and magnetic dipole moments and Michel parameters of the $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational scalar (vector) KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We also conjecture that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point scattering amplitudes with $N\!\geqslant 5$.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>Finite- and infinite-volume study of $DD\pi$ scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>Calculation of heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for calculating heavy quark effective theory (HQET) light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) by employing a sequential effective theory methodology. The theoretical foundation of the framework is established, elucidating how the quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi DAs) with three scales can be utilized to compute HQET LCDAs. We provide theoretical support for this approach by demonstrating the rationale behind devising a hierarchical ordering for the three involved scales, discussing the factorization at each step, clarifying the underlying reason for obtaining HQET LCDAs in the final phase, and addressing potential theoretical challenges. The lattice QCD simulation aspect is explored in detail, and the computations of quasi DAs are presented. We employ three fitting strategies to handle contributions from excited states and extract the bare matrix elements. For renormalization purposes, we apply hybrid renormalization schemes at short and long distance separations. To mitigate long-distance perturbations, we perform an extrapolation in $\lambda= z\cdot P^z$ and assess the stability against various parameters. After two-step matching, our results for HQET LCDAs are found in agreement with existing model parametrizations. The potential phenomenological implications of the results are discussed, shedding light on how these findings could impact our understanding of the strong interaction dynamics and physics beyond the standard model. It should be noted, however, that systematic uncertainties have not been accounted for yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Topological Defects from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates cosmic topological defects in gauge theories, focusing on models with an $SU(N)$ gauge group coupled with a single flavor, explored through a holographic framework. At low energies, the effective theory is described by an axion-like particle resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ flavor symmetry. As the Universe cools below a critical temperature, the chiral symmetry is broken, and non-trivial vacuum configurations form, resulting in the creation of cosmic strings and domain walls. We provide a UV description of these defects in a particular holographic theory, the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as probe D6-branes. We show the presence of a first-order phase transition separating string loop from domain wall solutions. String loops charged under the baryon symmetry and with angular momentum - vortons - can be understood as excitations of a topological phase of matter given by a Chern-Simons theory living on the D6-brane world volume. Finally, we provide an effective description of string loops and vortons in terms of degrees of freedom living on the flavor brane, i.e. mesonic modes.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.
