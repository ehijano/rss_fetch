      <title>Multi-Layer Network Formation through HAPS Base Station and Transmissive RIS-Equipped UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to bolster future wireless networks, there has been a great deal of interest in non-terrestrial networks, especially aerial platform stations including the high altitude platform station (HAPS) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). These platforms can integrate advanced technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this regard, this paper proposes a multi-layer network architecture to improve the performance of conventional HAPS super-macro base station (HAPS-SMBS)-assisted UAV. The architecture includes a HAPS-SMBS, UAVs equipped with active transmissive RIS, and ground Internet of things devices. We also consider multiple-input single-output (MISO) technology, by employing multiple antennas at the HAPS-SMBS and a single antenna at the Internet of things devices. Additionally, we consider NOMA as the multiple access technology as well as the existence of hardware impairments as a practical limitation. In particular, we compare the proposed system model with three different scenarios: HAPS-SMBS-assisted UAV that are equipped with active transmissive RIS and supported by single-input single-output system, HAPS-SMBS-assisted UAV that are equipped with amplify-and-forward relaying, and HAPS-SMBS-assisted UAV-equipped with passive transmissive RIS. Sum rate and energy efficiency are used as performance metrics, and the findings demonstrate that, in comparison to all benchmarks, the proposed system yields higher performance gain. Moreover, the hardware impairment limits the system performance at high transmit power levels.</description>

      <title>The Integrated Sensing and Communication Revolution for 6G: Vision, Techniques, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks will integrate sensing, learning and communication to provide new services beyond communication and to become more resilient. Sensors at the network infrastructure, sensors on the user equipment, and the sensing capability of the communication signal itself provide a new source of data that connects the physical and radio frequency environments. A wireless network that harnesses all these sensing data can not only enable additional sensing services, but also become more resilient to channel-dependent effects like blockage and better support adaptation in dynamic environments as networks reconfigure. In this paper, we provide a vision for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and an overview of how signal processing, optimization and machine learning techniques can be leveraged to make them a reality in the context of 6G. We also include some examples of the performance of several of these strategies when evaluated using a simulation framework based on a combination of ray tracing measurements and mathematical models that mix the digital and physical worlds.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NLoS RIS-Aided Localization with Optimization and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two machine learning optimization algorithms to significantly enhance position estimation in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) aided localization for mobile user equipment in Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. Leveraging the strengths of these algorithms, we present two methods capable of achieving extremely high accuracy, reaching sub-centimeter or even sub-millimeter levels at 3.5 GHz. The simulation results highlight the potential of these approaches, showing significant improvements in indoor mobile localization. The demonstrated precision and reliability of the proposed methods offer new opportunities for practical applications in real-world scenarios, particularly in Non-Line-of-Sight indoor localization. By evaluating four optimization techniques, we determine that a combination of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) results in localization errors under 30 cm in 90 % of the cases, and under 5 mm for close to 85 % of cases when considering a simulated room of 10 m by 10 m where two of the walls are equipped with RIS tiles.</description>

      <title>RF Chain-Free mmWave Transmission: Modeling and Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of millimeter wave frequency bands is expected to become prevalent in the following communication systems. However, generating and transmitting communication signals over these frequencies is not as straightforward as in sub-6 GHz frequencies due to complex transceiver structures. As an alternative to conventional transmitter architectures, this paper investigates the implementation of time-modulated arrays to effectively modulate and transmit high-quality communication signals at millimeter wave frequencies. By exploiting the array structures and analog beamformers, which are the fundamental components of millimeter wave transmitters, secure and low-cost transmission can be achieved. Though, harmonics of theoretically infinite bandwidth arise as a fundamental problem in this approach. Thus, this paper presents a frequency analysis tool for the time-modulated arrays with hardware impairments and shows how controlling the sampling period can reduce the harmonics. Furthermore, the derived results are experimentally verified at 25 GHz with two important remarks. First, the phase error of received signals can be reduced by 32% using the proposed architecture. Second, the harmonics can be significantly suppressed by the correct choice of sampling period for the given hardware.</description>

      <title>Rescale-Invariant Federated Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) offers a promising solution to various practical challenges in resource allocation for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. However, the data discrepancy among individual agents can significantly degrade the performance of FRL-based algorithms. To address this limitation, we exploit the node-wise invariance property of ReLU-activated neural networks, with the aim of reducing data discrepancy to improve learning performance. Based on this property, we introduce a backward rescale-invariant operation to develop a rescale-invariant FRL algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm notably enhances both convergence speed and convergent performance.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach in RIS-based Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of RIS-based indoor localization, our work introduces two distinct approaches to address real-world challenges. The first method is based on deep learning, employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The second, a novel LSTM-PSO hybrid, strategically takes advantage of deep learning and optimization techniques. Our simulations encompass practical scenarios, including variations in RIS placement and the intricate dynamics of multipath effects, all in Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. Our methods can achieve very high reliability, obtaining centimeter-level accuracy for the 98th percentile (worst case) in a different set of conditions, including the presence of the multipath effect. Furthermore, our hybrid approach showcases remarkable resolution, achieving sub-millimeter-level accuracy in numerous scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysing PolSAR data from vegetation by using the subaperture decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common assumption in radar remote sensing studies for vegetation is that radar returns originate from a target made up by a set of uniformly distributed isotropic scatterers. Nonetheless, several studies in the literature have noted that orientation effects and heterogeneities have a noticeable impact in backscattering signatures according to the specific vegetation type and sensor frequency. In this paper we have employed the subaperture decomposition technique (i.e. a time-frequency analysis) and the 3-D Barakat degree of polarisation to assess the variation of the volume backscatterig power as a function of the azimuth look angle. Three different datasets, i.e. multi-frequency indoor acquisitions over short vegetation samples, and P-band airborne data and L-band satellite data over boreal and tropical forest, respectively, have been employed in this study. We have argued that despite depolarising effects may be only sensed through a small portion of the synthetic aperture, they can lead to overestimated retrievals of the volume scattering for the full resolution image. This has direct implications in the existing model-based and model-free polarimetric SAR decompositions.</description>

      <title>AFDM Chirp-Permutation-Index Modulation with Quantum-Accelerated Codebook Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel index modulation (IM) scheme exploiting a unique feature of the recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. Dubbed AFDM chirp-permutation-index modulation (CPIM), the proposed method encodes additional information via the permutation of the discrete affine Fourier Transform (DAFT) chirp sequence, without any sacrifice of the various beneficial properties of the AFDM waveform in DD channels. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via simulation results leveraging a novel reduced-complexity minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE)-based maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, highlighting the gains over the classical AFDM. As part of the work two interesting problems related to optimizing AFDM-CPIM are identified: the optimal codebook design problem, over a discrete solution space of dimension $\binom{N!}{K}$, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers and $K$ is the number of codewords; and the ML detection problem whose solution space is of dimension $KM^N$, where $M$ is the constellation size. In order to alleviate the computational complexity of these problems and enable large-scale variations of AFDM-CPIM, the two problems are reformulated as a higher-order binary optimization problem and mapped to the well-known quantum Grover adaptive search (GAS) algorithm for their solution.</description>

      <title>Discrete Aware Matrix Completion via Convexized $\ell_0$-Norm Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank matrices in a structured setting where each entry can be chosen from a finite discrete alphabet set, such as in common recommender systems. The proposed low-rank matrix completion (MC) method is an improved variation of state-of-the-art (SotA) discrete aware matrix completion method which we previously proposed, in which discreteness is enforced by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer, not by replaced with the $\ell_1$-norm, but instead approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method compared to the SotA techniques as well as the earlier $\ell_1$-norm-based discrete-aware matrix completion approach.</description>

      <title>Multipath-based SLAM with Cooperation and Map Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach in wireless networks for obtaining position information of transmitters and receivers as well as information on the propagation environment. MP-SLAM models specular reflections of radio frequency (RF) signals at flat surfaces as virtual anchors (VAs), the mirror images of base stations (BSs). Conventional methods for MP-SLAM consider a single mobile terminal (MT) which has to be localized. The availability of additional MTs paves the way for utilizing additional information in the scenario. Specifically enabling MTs to exchange information allows for data fusion over different observations of VAs made by different MTs. Furthermore, cooperative localization becomes possible in addition to multipath-based localization. Utilizing this additional information enables more robust mapping and higher localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed generative neural networks for RF propagation prediction with application to indoor body perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models designed to predict Radio-Frequency (RF) propagation are time-consuming methods which prevent their adoption in strict real-time computational imaging problems, such as human body localization and sensing. Physics-informed Generative Neural Network (GNN) models have been recently proposed to reproduce EM effects, namely to simulate or reconstruct missing data or samples by incorporating relevant EM principles and constraints. The paper discusses a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model which is trained to reproduce the effects of human motions on the EM field and incorporate EM body diffraction principles. Proposed physics-informed generative neural network models are verified against both classical diffraction-based EM tools and full-wave EM body simulations.</description>

      <title>A Spiking Neural Network Decoder for Implantable Brain Machine Interfaces and its Sparsity-aware Deployment on RISC-V Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implantable Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are promising for motor rehabilitation and mobility augmentation, and they demand accurate and energy-efficient algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoder for regression tasks for implantable BMIs. The SNN is trained with enhanced spatio-temporal backpropagation to fully leverage its capability to handle temporal problems. The proposed SNN decoder outperforms the state-of-the-art Kalman filter and artificial neural network (ANN) decoders in offline finger velocity decoding tasks. The decoder is deployed on a RISC-V-based hardware platform and optimized to exploit sparsity. The proposed implementation has an average power consumption of 0.50 mW in a duty-cycled mode. When conducting continuous inference without duty-cycling, it achieves an energy efficiency of 1.88 uJ per inference, which is 5.5X less than the baseline ANN. Additionally, the average decoding latency is 0.12 ms for each inference, which is 5.7X faster than the ANN implementation.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Conceptual Dictionary Learning for Text Classification Using Information Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, lightweight supervised dictionary learning framework for text classification based on data compression and representation. This two-phase algorithm initially employs the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm to construct a dictionary from text datasets, focusing on the conceptual significance of dictionary elements. Subsequently, dictionaries are refined considering label data, optimizing dictionary atoms to enhance discriminative power based on mutual information and class distribution. This process generates discriminative numerical representations, facilitating the training of simple classifiers such as SVMs and neural networks. We evaluate our algorithm's information-theoretic performance using information bottleneck principles and introduce the information plane area rank (IPAR) as a novel metric to quantify the information-theoretic performance. Tested on six benchmark text datasets, our algorithm competes closely with top models, especially in limited-vocabulary contexts, using significantly fewer parameters. \review{Our algorithm closely matches top-performing models, deviating by only ~2\% on limited-vocabulary datasets, using just 10\% of their parameters. However, it falls short on diverse-vocabulary datasets, likely due to the LZW algorithm's constraints with low-repetition data. This contrast highlights its efficiency and limitations across different dataset types.</description>

      <title>Towards Green Communication: Soft Decoding Scheme for OOK Signals in Zero-Energy Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The booming of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to provide more intelligent and reliable communication services for higher network coverage, massive connectivity, and low-cost solutions for 6G services. However, frequent charging and battery replacement of these massive IoT devices brings a series of challenges. Zero energy devices, which rely on energy-harvesting technologies and can operate without battery replacement or charging, play a pivotal role in facilitating the massive use of IoT devices. In order to enable reliable communications of such low-power devices, Manchester-coded on-off keying (OOK) modulation and non-coherent detections are attractive techniques due to their energy efficiency, robustness in noisy environments, and simplicity in receiver design. Moreover, to extend their communication range, employing channel coding along with enhanced detection schemes is crucial. In this paper, a novel soft-decision decoder is designed for OOK-based low-power receivers to enhance their detection performance. In addition, exact closed-form expressions and two simplified approximations are derived for the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), an essential metric for soft decoding. Numerical results demonstrate the significant coverage gain achieved through soft decoding for convolutional code.</description>

      <title>Millimeter Wave Radar-based Human Activity Recognition for Healthcare Monitoring Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Healthcare monitoring is crucial, especially for the daily care of elderly individuals living alone. It can detect dangerous occurrences, such as falls, and provide timely alerts to save lives. Non-invasive millimeter wave (mmWave) radar-based healthcare monitoring systems using advanced human activity recognition (HAR) models have recently gained significant attention. However, they encounter challenges in handling sparse point clouds, achieving real-time continuous classification, and coping with limited monitoring ranges when statically mounted. To overcome these limitations, we propose RobHAR, a movable robot-mounted mmWave radar system with lightweight deep neural networks for real-time monitoring of human activities. Specifically, we first propose a sparse point cloud-based global embedding to learn the features of point clouds using the light-PointNet (LPN) backbone. Then, we learn the temporal pattern with a bidirectional lightweight LSTM model (BiLiLSTM). In addition, we implement a transition optimization strategy, integrating the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to improve the accuracy and robustness of the continuous HAR. Our experiments on three datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the previous studies in both discrete and continuous HAR tasks. Finally, we deploy our system on a movable robot-mounted edge computing platform, achieving flexible healthcare monitoring in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization in Panel-Based LIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channels orthogonality in a panel-based LIS scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in semi-passive mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the semi-passive processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the semi-passive processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network based Active and Passive Beamforming for Distributed STAR-RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint active and passive beamforming design for distributed simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multi-user (MU)- mutiple input single output (MISO) systems, where the energy splitting (ES) mode is considered for the STAR-RIS. We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</description>

      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>

      <title>XRLoc: Accurate UWB Localization to Realize XR Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the location of ultra-wideband (UWB) tag-attached objects and people in the real world is vital to enabling a smooth cyber-physical transition. However, most UWB localization systems today require multiple anchors in the environment, which can be very cumbersome to set up. In this work, we develop XRLoc, providing an accuracy of a few centimeters in many real-world scenarios. This paper will delineate the key ideas which allow us to overcome the fundamental restrictions that plague a single anchor point from localization of a device to within an error of a few centimeters. We deploy a VR chess game using everyday objects as a demo and find that our system achieves $2.4$ cm median accuracy and $5.3$ cm $90^\mathrm{th}$ percentile accuracy in dynamic scenarios, performing at least $8\times$ better than state-of-art localization systems. Additionally, we implement a MAC protocol to furnish these locations for over $10$ tags at update rates of $100$ Hz, with a localization latency of $\sim 1$ ms.</description>

      <title>Why Studying Cut-ins? Comparing Cut-ins and Other Lane Changes Based on Naturalistic Driving Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore vehicle lane changes, while the study on cut-ins has not received sufficient attention. The existing studies have not addressed the fundamental question of why studying cut-ins is crucial, despite the extensive investigation into lane changes. To tackle this issue, it is important to demonstrate how cut-ins, as a special type of lane change, differ from other lane changes. In this paper, we explore to compare driving characteristics of cut-ins and other lane changes based on naturalistic driving data. The highD dataset is employed to conduct the comparison. We extract all lane-change events from the dataset and exclude events that are not suitable for our comparison. Lane-change events are then categorized into the cut-in events and other lane-change events based on various gap-based rules. Several performance metrics are designed to measure the driving characteristics of the two types of events. We prove the significant differences between the cut-in behavior and other lane-change behavior by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results suggest the necessity of conducting specialized studies on cut-ins, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Extended Kalman filter -- Koopman operator for tractable stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of dual control was introduced more than seven decades ago. Although it has provided rich insights to the fields of control, estimation, and system identification, dual control is generally computationally prohibitive. In recent years, however, the use of Koopman operator theory for control applications has been emerging. This paper presents a new reformulation of the stochastic optimal control problem that, employing the Koopman operator, yields a standard LQR problem with the dual control as its solution. We provide a numerical example that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with certainty equivalence control, when applied to systems with varying observability.</description>

      <title>Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social learning is a non-Bayesian framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents towards a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>
