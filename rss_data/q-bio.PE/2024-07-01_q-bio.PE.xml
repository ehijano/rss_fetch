      <title>Comparing fine-grained and coarse-grained object detection for ecology</title>

Abstract: Computer vision applications are increasingly popular for wildlife monitoring tasks. While some studies focus on the monitoring of a single species, such as a particular endangered species, others monitor larger functional groups, such as predators. In our study, we used camera trap images collected in north-western New South Wales, Australia, to investigate how model results were affected by combining multiple species in single classes, and whether the addition of negative samples can improve model performance. We found that species that benefited the most from merging into a single class were mainly species that look alike morphologically, i.e. macropods. Whereas species that looked distinctively different gave mixed results when merged, e.g. merging pigs and goats together as non-native large mammals. We also found that adding negative samples improved model performance marginally in most instances, and recommend conducting a more comprehensive study to explore whether the marginal gains were random or consistent. We suggest that practitioners could classify morphologically similar species together as a functional group or higher taxonomic group to draw ecological inferences. Nevertheless, whether to merge classes or not will depend on the ecological question to be explored.</description>

      <title>Bernstein duality revisited: frequency-dependent selection, coordinated mutation and opposing environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population models usually come in pairs; one process describes forward evolution (e.g. type composition) and the other describes backward evolution (e.g. lines of descent). These processes are often linked by a formal relationship known as duality. Ideally, one of the two processes is easier to analyze, and the duality relation is so simple that properties of the more involved process can be inferred from the simpler one. This is the case when the forward process admits a moment dual. Unfortunately, moment duality seems to be the exception rather than the rule. Various approaches have been used to analyze models in the absence of a moment dual, one of them is based on Bernstein duality and another one on Siegmund duality. As a rule of thumb, the first approach seems to work well whenever the ancestral processes are positive recurrent; the second one, in contrast, works well in situations where the ancestral structures can grow to infinity (in size). The second approach was recently used to provide a full characterization of the long-term behavior of a broad class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes subject to frequency-dependent selection and opposing environments. In this paper, we use the first approach to complete the picture, i.e. we describe the long-term behavior of a different class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes, which covers many of the cases that were not covered by the aforementioned result (the two classes intersect, but none is a proper subset of the other one). Moreover, we extend the notion of Bernstein duality to cases with (single and coordinated) mutations {and environmental selection}, and we use it to show ergodic properties of the process.</description>

      <title>The coalescent in finite populations with arbitrary, fixed structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other features of real-world populations. To further extend the range of population structures to which coalescent theory applies, we formulate a coalescent process for a broad class of neutral drift models with arbitrary -- but fixed -- spatial, age, sex, and class structure, haploid or diploid genetics, and any fixed mating pattern. Here, the coalescent is represented as a random sequence of mappings $\mathcal{C} = \left(C_t\right)_{t=0}^\infty$ from a finite set $G$ to itself. The set $G$ represents the ``sites'' (in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at which these alleles can live. The state of the coalescent, $C_t:G \to G$, maps each site $g \in G$ to the site containing $g$'s ancestor, $t$ time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio $r$, we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any set of sites, are scaled by $4r(1-r)$ relative to the even sex ratio case.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of a Coupled SIS Bi-Virus Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the setting where two viruses (say virus 1 and virus 2) coexist in a population, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, in the sense that infection due to one virus does not preclude the possibility of simultaneous infection due to the other. We develop a coupled bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model from a 4n-state Markov chain model, where n is the number of agents (i.e., individuals or subpopulation) in the population. We identify a sufficient condition for both viruses to eventually die out, and a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium of each virus. We establish a sufficient condition and multiple necessary conditions for local exponential convergence to the boundary equilibrium (i.e., one virus persists, the other one dies out) of each virus. Under mild assumptions on the healing rate, we show that there cannot exist a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 1; a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 2; but no fraction that is infected by both viruses 1 and 2. Likewise, assuming that healing rates are strictly positive, a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected by both viruses 1 and 2, but no fraction is infected only by virus 1 (resp. virus 2) does not exist. Further, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of certain other kinds of coexisting equilibria. We show that, unlike the competitive bivirus model, the coupled bivirus model is not monotone. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings using an extensive set of in-depth simulations.</description>

      <title>A picture guide to cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models: evolutionary assumptions, plausible interpretations, and alternative uses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06824v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models were developed to discover dependencies in the irreversible acquisition of binary traits from cross-sectional data. They have been used in computational oncology and virology but also in widely different problems such as malaria progression. These methods have been applied to predict future states of the system, identify routes of feature acquisition, and improve patient stratification, and they hold promise for evolutionary-based treatments. New methods continue to be developed.
  But these methods have shortcomings, which are yet to be systematically critiqued, regarding key evolutionary assumptions and interpretations. After an overview of the available methods, we focus on why inferences might not be about the processes we intend. Using fitness landscapes, we highlight difficulties that arise from bulk sequencing and reciprocal sign epistasis, from conflating lines of descent, path of the maximum, and mutational profiles, and from ambiguous use of the idea of exclusivity. We examine how the previous concerns change when bulk sequencing is explicitly considered, and underline opportunities for addressing dependencies due to frequency-dependent selection. This review identifies major standing issues, and should encourage the use of these methods in other areas with a better alignment between entities and model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection and Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. We show that the time evolution of certain quantum mechanical toy models is similar to that of a living cell. It is also suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>
