      <title>Danceability, Directed by Braid Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schaffer introduced the concept of danceability of a knot diagram. In this paper, we expand upon Schaffer's ideas to create a danceability knot invariant and show that this invariant is bounded above by the braid index.</description>

      <title>Studying knots in covers of the modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a combinatorial tool to help study some topological properties of modular knots. We construct templates for the infinitely many Anosov flows on the trefoil complement, which are lifts of the geodesic flow on the modular surface, by lifting Ghys' modular template using self-covering of the trefoil complement of order $6k+1$, for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$. This allows to study the knot properties of closed geodesics in these flows, and an explicit construction of an infinite family of links of two components with one of them being the trefoil, all commensurable to one another.</description>

      <title>Homology Covers of Riemann Surfaces and Automorphisms: Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If either $k \geq 2$ is an integer or $k=\infty$, then associated to a Riemann surface $S$ is its $k$-homoly cover $\widetilde{S}_{k}$. The surface $\widetilde{S}_{k}$ has a group of conformal automorphisms $M_{k} \cong {\rm H}_{1}(S;{\mathbb Z}_{k})$, where ${\mathbb Z}_{\infty}={\mathbb Z}$, such that $S=\widetilde{S}_{k}/M_{k}$. Moreover, for every group $L \leq {\rm Aut}(S)$, there is a short exact sequence $1 \to M_{k} \to \widetilde{L}_{k} \to L \to 1$, where $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ is a subgroup of conformal automorphisms of $\widetilde{S}_{k}$. If $k \neq \infty$ and $S$ is analytically finite and non-exceptional, then $M_{k}$, $\widetilde{L}_{k}$ and $L$ are finite groups. In this case, if $k$ and $|L|$, the order of $L$, are relatively prime integers, then the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem asserts that $\widetilde{L}_{k} \cong M_{k} \rtimes L$. In this paper, we investigate situations when $k$ and $|L|$ are not necesarily relatively primes.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Margulis space-times with parabolics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a flat Lorentzian space of signature $(2, 1)$. A Margulis space-time is a noncompact complete Lorentz flat $3$-manifold $E/\Gamma$ with a free isometry group $\Gamma$ of rank $g \geq 2$. We consider the case when $\Gamma$ contains a parabolic element. We show that sufficiently small deformations of $\Gamma$ still act properly on $E$. We use our previous work showing that $E/\Gamma$ can be compactified relative to a union of solid tori and some old idea of Carri\`ere in his famous work. We will show that the there is also a decomposition of $E/\Gamma$ by crooked planes that are disjoint and embedded in a generalized sense. These can be perturbed so that $E/\Gamma$ decomposes into cells. This partially affirms the conjecture of Charette-Drumm-Goldman.</description>

      <title>Complete Riemannian 4-manifolds with uniformly positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain topological obstructions to the existence of a complete Riemannian metric with uniformly positive scalar curvature on certain (non-compact) $4$-manifolds. In particular, such a metric on the interior of a compact contractible $4$-manifold uniquely distinguishes the standard $4$-ball up to diffeomorphism among Mazur manifolds and up to homeomorphism in general.
  We additionally show there exist uncountably many exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s that do not admit such a metric and that any (non-compact) tame $4$-manifold has a smooth structure that does not admit such a metric.</description>

      <title>Integral invariants for framed 3-manifolds associated to trivalent graphs possibly with self-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bott--Cattaneo's theory defines the integral invariants for a framed rational homology 3-sphere equipped with an acyclic orthogonal local system, in terms of graph cocycles without self-loops. The 2-loop term of their invariants is associated with the theta graph. Their definition requires a cohomological condition. Cattaneo--Shimizu removed this cohomological condition and gave a 2-loop invariant associated with a linear combination of the theta graph and the dumbbell graph, the 2-loop trivalent graph with self-loops. In this paper, we are concerned with an acyclic local system given by the adjoint representation of a semi-simple Lie group composed with a representation of the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold, and we show that through a cohomological construction eventually the integral associated with the dumbbell graph vanishes. Based on this idea, we construct a theory of graph complexes and cocycles, so that higher-loop invariants can be defined by two different but equivalent methods: the graph cocycles without self-loops as in Bott--Cattaneo's theory, and the ones with self-loops that extend Cattaneo--Shimizu's 2-loop invariants. As a consequence, we prove that the generating series of Chern--Simons perturbation theory gives rise to topological invariants for framed 3-manifolds in our setting, which admits a formula in terms of only trivalent graphs without self-loops.</description>

      <title>Entropy versus volume via Heegaard diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following inequalities are established, improving a former inequality due to Kojima. For any closed arithmetic hyperbolic $3$--manifold fibering over a circle, the entropy of the pseudo-Anosov monodromy is bounded by the hyperbolic volume of the $3$--manifold, up to a universal constant factor. For any closed hyperbolic $3$--manifold fibering over a circle with systole $\geq\varepsilon&gt;0$, the entropy is bounded by the hyperbolic volume times $\log(3+1/\varepsilon)$, up to a universal constant factor. The proof relies on Heegaard Floer homology and hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a non-trivial element $c$ in $\widehat{HF}(-Y)$, there exists a tight contact structure $\xi$ on $Y$ whose contact invariant realizes $c$ if and only if there exists a non-trivial fibered knot $K$ such that $-\tau_c(K)=g(K)$. Moreover, when such a fibered knot $K$ does exist, $\xi$ can be chosen to satisfy the extra condition that $K$ admits a Legendrian representative with Thurston-Bennequin number tb$(K)$ equal to $0$ in $(Y,\xi)$.</description>

      <title>The reducing sphere complexes for the $3$-sphere are connected: a proof of the Powell Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The genus-$g$ Goeritz group is the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving self-homeomorphisms of the $3$-sphere that preserve the genus-$g$ Heegaard splitting of the $3$-sphere. In 1933, Goeritz found first a finite generating set of the genus-$2$ Goeritz group. The Powell Conjecture offers four specific elements that suffice to generate higher genus Goeritz group. We show that the reducing sphere complexes for the higher genus splittings of the $3$-sphere are all connected, and consequently the conjecture is true.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic K-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L\"oh; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cremona groups are the groups of all birational equivalences of rational varieties and, equivalently, the automorphism groups of the rational function fields. In this note, we explain that homological stability fails for them in both possible ways and comment on their stable homology.</description>
