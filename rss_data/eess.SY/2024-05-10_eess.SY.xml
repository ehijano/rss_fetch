      <title>Eco-driving Accounting for Interactive Cut-in Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicles can gather information about surrounding traffic and plan safe and energy-efficient driving behavior, which is known as eco-driving. Conventional eco-driving designs only consider preceding vehicles in the same lane as the ego vehicle. In heavy traffic, however, vehicles in adjacent lanes may cut into the ego vehicle's lane, influencing the ego vehicle's eco-driving behavior and compromising the energy-saving performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an eco-driving design that accounts for neighbor vehicles that have cut-in intentions. Specifically, we integrate a leader-follower game to predict the interaction between the ego and the cut-in vehicles and a model-predictive controller for planning energy-efficient behavior for the automated ego vehicle. We show that the leader-follower game model can reasonably represent the interactive motion between the ego vehicle and the cut-in vehicle. More importantly, we show that the proposed design can predict and react to neighbor vehicles' cut-in behaviors properly, leading to improved energy efficiency in cut-in scenarios compared to baseline designs that consider preceding vehicles only.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Holonic Architecture with Natural Language Processing for System of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity and dynamic nature of System of Systems (SoS) necessitate efficient communication mechanisms to ensure interoperability and collaborative functioning among constituent systems, termed holons. This paper proposes an innovative approach to enhance holon communication within SoS through the integration of Conversational Generative Intelligence (CGI) techniques. Our approach leverages advancements in CGI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to enable holons to understand and act on natural language instructions. This fosters more intuitive human-holon interactions, improving social intelligence and ultimately leading to better coordination among diverse systems. This position paper outlines a conceptual framework for CGI-enhanced holon interaction, discusses the potential impact on SoS adaptability, usability and efficiency, and sets the stage for future exploration and prototype implementation.</description>

      <title>3-way equal filtering power divider using compact folded-arms square open-Loop resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstrip three-way (that is, 4.8 dB) integrated filtering power divider (FPD) is presented in this paper. The proposed FPD evenly distributes an input power signal into three equal output signals. The design incorporates balanced signal power division, and filtering technology for the removal of unwanted frequency elements and aimed at enhancing signal quality and efficiency in the radiofrequency (RF) front-end of communication systems. Microstrip folded-arms square open-loop resonator (FASOLR) is employed in the design implementation to achieve compact size. The proposed FPD features a 2.6 GHz centre frequency, with a 0.03 fractional bandwidth. The implementation is carried out on Rogers RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate with a dielectric constant of 10.7, a thickness of 1.27 mm and a loss tangent of 0.0023. The good agreement between the theoretical and practical results verifies the effectiveness of the FPD in delivering equal power outputs at the three output ports, and at the same time filtering out unwanted frequencies. The practical results of the prototype FPD indicate a good return loss of better than 15.5 dB and an insertion loss of better than 4.77+0.34 dB. The design prototype achieved compact size of 0.31 {\lambda}g x 0.18 {\lambda}g. {\lambda}g is the guided wavelength for the microstrip line impedance at the centre frequency of the 3-way equal filtering power divider.</description>

      <title>ATLS: Automated Trailer Loading for Surface Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated docking technologies of marine boats have been enlightened by an increasing number of literature. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing a mathematical framework that automates "trailer loading" in the presence of wind disturbances, which is unexplored despite its importance to boat owners. The comprehensive pipeline of localization, system identification, and trajectory optimization is structured, followed by several techniques to improve performance reliability. The performance of the proposed method was demonstrated with a commercial pontoon boat in Michigan, in 2023, securing a success rate of 80\% in the presence of perception errors and wind disturbance. This result indicates the strong potential of the proposed pipeline, effectively accommodating the wind effect.</description>

      <title>2-16 GHz Multifrequency X-Cut Lithium Niobate NEMS Resonators on a Single Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design, fabrication, and testing of X-Cut Lithium Niobate (LN) acoustic nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) Laterally Vibrating Resonators (LVRs) and Degenerate LVRs (d-LVRs) operating in the S0 (YZ30) and SH0 (YZ-10) modes between 2 to 16 GHz range, monolithically fabricated on a single chip. The NEMS topology is optimized to extend the aforementioned fundamental modes in the C-, X-, and Ku-bands while preserving performance and mass manufacturability. The devices present acoustic wavelengths ({\lambda}) varying between 1800 and 400 nm and are fabricated on a 100 nm ultra-thin LN film on high resistivity silicon with a 3-mask process. Experimental results highlighted quality factor at resonance (Qs) and mechanical quality factors (Qm) as high as 477 and 1750, respectively, and electromechanical coupling (kt2) as high as 32.7%. Large kt2 (&gt;10%) are recorded over a broad range of frequencies (2 - 8 GHz), while Qm exceeding 100 are measured up to 15 GHz. Further enhancement to performance and range of operation on the same chip can be achieved by decreasing {\lambda}, refining the fabrication process, and optimizing device topology. These additional steps can help pave the way for manufacturing high-performance resonators on a single chip covering the entire 1 - 25 GHz spectrum.</description>

      <title>Achieving Precisely-Assigned Performance Requirements for Spacecraft Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the attitude control problem of spacecraft, with the objective of achieving precise performance criteria including precise settling time, steady-state error, and overshoot elimination. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Precisely-Assigned Performance (PAP) control scheme. Firstly, we utilize a parameterized function to explicitly characterize a reference for the transient responses, termed the Reference Performance Function (RPF). Subsequently, leveraging the concept of the RPF, we define a performance-satisfied tube region and introduce the concept of control barrier functions to derive a sufficient condition for the state trajectory to converge and remain confined within this tube region. By introducing the concept of Sontag's universal formula for stabilization, a PAP controller, constructed based on the backstepping method, is then designed to guide the system to satisfy these affine constraint conditions, and a disturbance observer is further integrated to handle perturbations. Theoretical proofs are presented to demonstrate the controller's capability to establish the boundedness of the overall system and ensure that each state trajectory will converge into the performance-satisfied region within a finite time duration under any conditions. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Non-myopic GOSPA-driven Gaussian Bernoulli Sensor Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for non-myopic sensor management for Bernoulli filtering, i.e., when there may be at most one target present in the scene. The algorithm is based on selecting the action that solves a Bellman-type minimisation problem, whose cost function is the mean square generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) error, over a future time window. We also propose an implementation of the sensor management algorithm based on an upper bound of the mean square GOSPA error and a Gaussian single-target posterior. Finally, we develop a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find an approximate optimal action within a given computational budget. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated via simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation for a 3-D Moving Target in Quaternion Space with Unknown Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For distributed estimations in a sensor network, the consistency and accuracy of an estimator are greatly affected by the unknown correlations between individual estimates. An inconsistent or too conservative estimate may degrade the estimation performance and even cause divergence of the estimator. Cooperative estimation methods based on Inverse Covariance Intersection (ICI) can utilize a network of sensors to provide a consistent and tight estimate of a target. In this paper, unlike most existing ICI-based estimators that only consider two-dimensional (2-D) target state estimation in the vector space, we address this problem in a 3-D environment by extending the ICI algorithm to the augmented quaternion space. In addition, the proposed algorithm is fully distributed, as each agent only uses the local information from itself and its communication neighbors, which is also robust to a time-varying communication topology. To evaluate the performance, we test the proposed algorithm in a camera network to track the pose of a target. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to show the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Small-Scale Testbed for Evaluating C-V2X Applications on 5G Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a small-scale testbed for evaluating the real-life performance of cellular V2X (C-V2X) applications on 5G cellular networks. Despite the growing interest and rapid technology development for V2X applications, researchers still struggle to prototype V2X applications with real wireless networks, hardware, and software in the loop in a controlled environment. To help alleviate this challenge, we present a testbed designed to accelerate development and evaluation of C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. By including a small-scale vehicle platform into the testbed design, we significantly reduce the time and effort required to test new C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. With a focus around the integration of small-scale vehicle platforms, we detail the design decisions behind the full software and hardware setup of commonly needed intelligent transport system agents (e.g. sensors, servers, vehicles). Moreover, to showcase the testbed's capability to produce industrially-relevant, real world performance evaluations, we present an evaluation of a simple test case inspired from shared situational awareness. Finally, we discuss the upcoming use of the testbed for evaluating 5G cellular network-based shared situational awareness and other C-V2X applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Posture Manipulation During Tumbling for Closed-Loop Heading Angle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive tumbling uses natural forces like gravity for efficient travel. But without an active means of control, passive tumblers must rely entirely on external forces. Northeastern University's COBRA is a snake robot that can morph into a ring, which employs passive tumbling to traverse down slopes. However, due to its articulated joints, it is also capable of dynamically altering its posture to manipulate the dynamics of the tumbling locomotion for active steering. This paper presents a modelling and control strategy based on collocation optimization for real-time steering of COBRA's tumbling locomotion. We validate our approach using Matlab simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological bifurcations in a mean-field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) provide a statistical physics inspired modeling framework for decision making in large-populations of strategic, non-cooperative agents. Mathematically, these systems consist of a forward-backward in time system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Fokker-Plank and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, governing the agent state and control distribution, respectively. In this work, we study a finite-time MFG with a rich global bifurcation structure using a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is a 4D two-point boundary value problem obtained by restricting the controlled dynamics to first two moments of the agent state distribution, i.e., the mean and the variance. Phase space analysis of the ROM reveals that the invariant manifolds of periodic orbits around the so-called `ergodic MFG equilibrium' play a crucial role in determining the bifurcation diagram, and impart a topological signature to various solution branches. We show a qualitative agreement of these results with numerical solutions of the full-order MFG PDE system.</description>

      <title>Banking Turn of High-DOF Dynamic Morphing Wing Flight by Shifting Structure Response Using Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3D flight control of a flapping wing robot is a very challenging problem. The robot stabilizes and controls its pose through the aerodynamic forces acting on the wing membrane which has complex dynamics and it is difficult to develop a control method to interact with such a complex system. Bats, in particular, are capable of performing highly agile aerial maneuvers such as tight banking and bounding flight solely using their highly flexible wings. In this work, we develop a control method for a bio-inspired bat robot, the Aerobat, using small low-powered actuators to manipulate the flapping gait and the resulting aerodynamic forces. We implemented a controller based on collocation approach to track a desired roll and perform a banking maneuver to be used in a trajectory tracking controller. This controller is implemented in a simulation to show its performance and feasibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intelligent identification and precise plucking are the keys to intelligent tea harvesting robots, which are of increasing significance nowadays. Aiming at plucking tender leaves for high-quality green tea producing, in this paper, a tender leaf identification algorithm and a mechanically perceptible plucking finger have been proposed. RESULTS: Based on segmentation algorithm and color features, the tender leaf identification algorithm shows an average identification accuracy of over 92.8%. The mechanically perceptible plucking finger plucks tender leaves in a way that a human hand does so as to remain high quality of tea products. Though finite element analysis, we determine the ideal size of grippers and the location of strain gauge attachment on a gripper to enable the employment of feedback control of desired gripping force. Revealed from our experiments, the success rate of tender leaf plucking reaches 92.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design. CONCLUSION: The results show that the tender leaf identification algorithm and the mechanically perceptible plucking finger are effective for tender leaves identification and plucking, providing a foundation for the development of an intelligent tender leaf plucking robot.</description>

      <title>From Road Congestion to Vehicle-Control Enabled Artificial Traffic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the design of nonlinear feedback Cruise Controllers (CCs) for automated vehicles on lane-free roads. The feedback design problem is particularly challenging because of the various state constraints (e.g., collision-free movement, road geometry, speed limits) as well as the nature of the control objective (globally stabilizing distributed controllers that require measurements from neighboring vehicles only). Therefore, the resulting nonlinear control system is defined on an open set (not necessarily diffeomorphic to a linear space) for which the set of desired equilibria is non-compact. The proposed design of the CCs is based on energy-like control Lyapunov functions which combine potential functions with kinetic energy terms and other appropriate penalty terms. The feedback design in the microscopic level is accompanied by the derivation of the corresponding macroscopic traffic flow models. Explicit relations are established between selectable CC features and the obtained macroscopic traffic flow characteristics. This facilitates the active design of efficient traffic flow with desired properties, i.e., the construction of artificial traffic fluids.</description>

      <title>Intelligent EC Rearview Mirror: Enhancing Driver Safety with Dynamic Glare Mitigation via Cloud Edge Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden glare from trailing vehicles significantly increases driving safety risks. Existing anti-glare technologies such as electronic, manually-adjusted, and electrochromic rearview mirrors, are expensive and lack effective adaptability in different lighting conditions. To address these issues, our research introduces an intelligent rearview mirror system utilizing novel all-liquid electrochromic technology. This system integrates IoT with ensemble and federated learning within a cloud edge collaboration framework, dynamically controlling voltage to effectively eliminate glare and maintain clear visibility. Utilizing an ensemble learning model, it automatically adjusts mirror transmittance based on light intensity, achieving a low RMSE of 0.109 on the test set. Furthermore, the system leverages federated learning for distributed data training across devices, which enhances privacy and updates the cloud model continuously. Distinct from conventional methods, our experiment utilizes the Schmidt-Clausen and Bindels de Boer 9-point scale with TOPSIS for comprehensive evaluation of rearview mirror glare. Designed to be convenient and costeffective, this system demonstrates how IoT and AI can significantly enhance rearview mirror anti-glare performance.</description>

      <title>Guess the Drift with LOP-UKF: LiDAR Odometry and Pacejka Model for Real-Time Racecar Sideslip Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sideslip angle, crucial for vehicle safety and stability, is determined using both longitudinal and lateral velocities. However, measuring the lateral component often necessitates costly sensors, leading to its common estimation, a topic thoroughly explored in existing literature. This paper introduces LOP-UKF, a novel method for estimating vehicle lateral velocity by integrating Lidar Odometry with the Pacejka tire model predictions, resulting in a robust estimation via an Unscendent Kalman Filter (UKF). This combination represents a distinct alternative to more traditional methodologies, resulting in a reliable solution also in edge cases. We present experimental results obtained using the Dallara AV-21 across diverse circuits and track conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Passive Obstacle Aware Control to Follow Desired Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating and updating the obstacle avoidance velocity for an autonomous robot in real-time ensures robust- ness against noise and disturbances. A passive damping con- troller can obtain the desired motion with a torque-controlled robot, which remains compliant and ensures a safe response to external perturbations. Here, we propose a novel approach for designing the passive control policy. Our algorithm com- plies with obstacle-free zones while transitioning to increased damping near obstacles to ensure collision avoidance. This approach ensures stability across diverse scenarios, effectively mitigating disturbances. Validation on a 7DoF robot arm demonstrates superior collision rejection capabilities compared to the baseline, underlining its practicality for real-world ap- plications. Our obstacle-aware damping controller represents a substantial advancement in secure robot control within complex and uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay and sensor reception ratio of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field train experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency up to 76.5% in average and identifies the worst transmission delay accurately.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of affine-control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of affine-control systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound System for Liver Follow-up Diagnosis: Pilot Phantom Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel autonomous robot ultrasound (US) system targeting liver follow-up scans for outpatients in local communities. Given a computed tomography (CT) image with specific target regions of interest, the proposed system carries out the autonomous follow-up scan in three steps: (i) initial robot contact to surface, (ii) coordinate mapping between CT image and robot, and (iii) target US scan. Utilizing 3D US-CT registration and deep learning-based segmentation networks, we can achieve precise imaging of 3D hepatic veins, facilitating accurate coordinate mapping between CT and the robot. This enables the automatic localization of follow-up targets within the CT image, allowing the robot to navigate precisely to the target's surface. Evaluation of the ultrasound phantom confirms the quality of the US-CT registration and shows the robot reliably locates the targets in repeated trials. The proposed framework holds the potential to significantly reduce time and costs for healthcare providers, clinicians, and follow-up patients, thereby addressing the increasing healthcare burden associated with chronic disease in local communities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the reaction coefficient of a system governed by a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation is tackled. An estimator relying on boundary measurements only is proposed. The estimator is based upon a setpoint regulation strategy and leads to an asymptotically converging estimate of the unknown reaction coefficient. The proposed estimator is combined with a state observer and shown to provide an asymptotic estimate of the actual system state. A numerical example supports and illustrates the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Towed Cable with Sensor-Array for Underwater Target Motion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During a war situation, many times an underwater target motion analysis (TMA) is performed using bearing-only measurements, obtained from a sensor array, which is towed by an own-ship with the help of a connected cable. It is well known that the own-ship is required to perform a manoeuvre in order to make the system observable and localise the target successfully. During the maneuver, it is important to know the location of the sensor array with respect to the own-ship. This paper develops a dynamic model of a cable-sensor array system to localise the sensor array, which is towed behind a sea-surface vessel. We adopt a lumped-mass approach to represent the towed cable. The discretized cable elements are modelled as an interconnected rigid body, kinematically related to one another. The governing equations are derived by balancing the moments acting on each node. The derived dynamics are solved simultaneously for all the nodes to determine the orientation of the cable and sensor array. The position of the sensor array obtained from this proposed model will further be used by TMA algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the tracking system.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of linear systems with multiple quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of dynamical systems that are linear in the state equation and up to quadratic nonlinearity in the output equation. As our primary theoretical contributions, we derive gradients of the squared $\mathcal{H}_2$ system error with respect to the reduced model quantities and, from the stationary points of these gradients, introduce Gramian-based first-order necessary conditions for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal approximation of a linear quadratic output (LQO) system. The resulting $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimality framework neatly generalizes the analogous Gramian-based optimality framework for purely linear systems. Computationally, we show how to enforce the necessary optimality conditions using Petrov-Galerkin projection; the corresponding projection matrices are obtained from a pair of Sylvester equations. Based on this result, we propose an iteratively corrected algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction of LQO systems, which we refer to as LQO-TSIA (linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm). Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed computational method against other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity under Net Energy Metering</title>

Abstract: The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description>

Abstract: Optimal and safety-critical control are fundamental problems for stochastic systems, and are widely considered in real-world scenarios such as robotic manipulation and autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of efficiently finding optimal and safe control for high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we propose to use dimensionality reduction techniques from a comparison theorem for stochastic differential equations together with a generalizable physics-informed neural network to estimate the optimal value function and the safety probability of the system. The proposed framework results in substantial sample efficiency improvement compared to existing methods. We further develop an autoencoder-like neural network to automatically identify the low-dimensional features of the system to enhance the ease of design for system integration. We also provide experiments and quantitative analysis to validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Source code is available at https://github.com/jacobwang925/path-integral-PINN.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</description>

      <title>Composite Distributed Learning and Synchronization of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Complete Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of composite synchronization and learning control in a network of multi-agent robotic manipulator systems with heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties under a leader-follower framework. A novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy is introduced, comprising a first-layer distributed cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. The first layer is to facilitate each robotic agent's estimation of the leader's information. The second layer is responsible for both controlling individual robot agents to track desired reference trajectories and accurately identifying/learning their nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The proposed distributed learning control scheme represents an advancement in the existing literature due to its ability to manage robotic agents with completely uncertain dynamics including uncertain mass matrices. This allows the robotic control to be environment-independent which can be used in various settings, from underwater to space where identifying system dynamics parameters is challenging. The stability and parameter convergence of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging an algebraic approach built on minimal realizations and conditional expectations in quantum probability, we propose a method to reduce the dimension of quantum filters in discrete-time, while maintaining the correct distributions on the measurement outcomes and the expectations of some relevant observable. The method is presented for general quantum systems whose dynamics depend on measurement outcomes, hinges on a system-theoretic observability analysis, and is tested on prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Designing a sector-coupled European energy system robust to 60 years of historical weather data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification, they encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand. However, most infrastructure planning is based on a single weather year, resulting in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize energy infrastructure for a European energy system designed for net-zero CO$_2$ emissions in 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the capacity layouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate resource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual weather variability causes variation of $\pm$10\% in total system cost. The most expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not the highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years including compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective design. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective robustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the average CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\% of 1990 levels. Our findings highlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures, making them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of historical weather data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, especially as diverse low-carbon technologies (e.g., photovoltaic and electric vehicles) are increasingly adopted. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it demonstrates superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical models, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</description>
