      <title>Existence of weak mean curvature flow with prescribed contact angle via elliptic regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the existence of Brakke-type weak mean curvature flow satisfying the contact angle condition for general angle $ \theta \in ( 0 , \pi ) $ via Ilmanen's regularization. The main ingredients of the result are the establishment of a compactness theorem for varifolds with the contact angle and the extension of Ilmanen's regularization to the capillarity.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Kundt spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to Kundt spaces, clarifying several important properties, many of which are typically scattered across the mathematical literature or presented without explicit reference to Kundt terminology. While not exhaustive, our approach aims to offer a pedagogical introduction, using a more geometric language and focusing on key concepts directly related to these spaces, such as lightlike totally geodesic foliations.</description>

      <title>The Willmore problem for surfaces with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Willmore Problem seeks the surface in $\mathbb{S}^3\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ of a given topological type minimizing the squared-mean-curvature energy $W = \int |H_{\mathbb{R}^4}|^2 = area + \int |H_{\mathbb{S}^3}|^2$. The longstanding Willmore Conjecture that the Clifford torus minimizes $W$ among genus-$1$ surfaces is now a theorem of Marques and Neves [22], but the general conjecture \cite[12] that Lawson's [18] minimal surface $\xi_{g,1}\subset\mathbb{S}^3$ minimizes $W$ among surfaces of genus $g&gt;1$ remains open. Here we prove this conjecture under the additional assumption that the competitor surfaces $M\subset\mathbb{S}^3$ share the ambient symmetries $\widehat{G}_{g,1}$ of $\xi_{g,1}$. In fact, we show each Lawson surface $\xi_{m,k}$ satisfies the analogous $W$-minimizing property under a smaller symmetry group $\widetilde{G}_{m,k}=\widehat{G}_{m,k}\cap SO(4)$. We also describe a genus 2 example where known methods do not ensure the existence of a $W$-minimizer among surfaces with its symmetry.</description>

      <title>An iterative construction of complete K\"ahler--Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Tsuji's iterative construction of a K\"ahler--Einstein metric with negative scalar curvature to (non-compact) K\"ahler manifolds with bounded geometry, using Berndtsson's method for the compact setting. Consequently, given a holomorphic surjective map $p:X \to Y$, where $X$ is a weakly pseudoconvex K\"ahler manifold and $Y$ is a complex manifold, whose smooth fibers admit K\"ahler--Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature and bounded geometry, we show that the fiberwise K\"ahler--Einstein metric induces a semi-positively curved metric on the relative canonical bundle $K_{X/Y}$ of $p$. Moreover, our approach can be applied to obtain the plurisubharmonic variation of cusp K\"ahler--Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>An elliptic proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the splitting theorems from Lorentzian geometry, in which simplicity is gained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity (non-uniformly) elliptic $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. This allows us to bring the Eschenburg, Galloway, and Newman Lorentzian splitting theorems into a framework closer to the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>A note on traces for the Heisenberg calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we gave a local formula for the index of Heisenberg elliptic operators on contact manifolds. We constructed a cocycle in periodic cyclic cohomology which, when paired with the Connes-Chern character of the principal Heisenberg symbol, calculates the index. A crucial ingredient of our index formula was a new trace on the algebra of Heisenberg pseudodifferential operators. The construction of this trace was rather involved. In the present paper, we clarify the nature of this trace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the ADM mass of the time slices of $(n + 1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. This extends the Minkowski inequality for static vacuum spacetimes, which relates the total mass of a time slice to the area and total mean curvature of its boundary. As a corollary, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions and with rigidity for static manifolds under the TCC.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal Density-Equalizing Map for Genus-0 Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization is a fundamental task in geometry processing and plays an important role in many science and engineering applications. In recent years, the density-equalizing map, a shape deformation technique based on the physical principle of density diffusion, has been utilized for the parameterization of simply connected and multiply connected open surfaces. More recently, a spherical density-equalizing mapping method has been developed for the parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces. However, for genus-0 closed surfaces with extreme geometry, using a spherical domain for the parameterization may induce large geometric distortion. In this work, we develop a novel method for computing density-equalizing maps of genus-0 closed surfaces onto an ellipsoidal domain. This allows us to achieve ellipsoidal area-preserving parameterizations and ellipsoidal parameterizations with controlled area change. We further propose an energy minimization approach that combines density-equalizing maps and quasi-conformal maps, which allows us to produce ellipsoidal density-equalizing quasi-conformal maps for achieving a balance between density-equalization and quasi-conformality. Using our proposed methods, we can significantly improve the performance of surface remeshing for genus-0 closed surfaces. Experimental results on a large variety of genus-0 closed surfaces are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psychometrics and quantitative psychology rely strongly on statistical models to measure psychological processes. As a branch of mathematics, geometry is inherently connected to measurement and focuses on properties such as distance and volume. However, despite the common root of measurement, geometry is currently not used a lot in psychological measurement. In this paper, my aim is to illustrate how ideas from non-Euclidean geometry may be relevant for psychometrics.</description>

Abstract: Given a complex-projective klt pair $(X, \Delta)$ with standard coefficients and such that $K_X + \Delta$ is ample, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the pair $(X, \Delta)$ to be uniformized by a bounded symmetric domain. As an application, we obtain characterizations of orbifold quotients of the polydisc and of the four classical irreducible bounded symmetric domains in terms of Miyaoka-Yau-type Chern equalities.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>

      <title>Classification results for conformally K\"ahler gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13197v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic geometry of Hermitian non-K\"ahler Ricci-flat metrics with finite $\int|Rm|^2$ at infinity. Specifically, we prove:
  1. Any such metric is asymptotic to an ALE, ALF-A, AF, skewed special Kasner, ALH* model at infinity.
  2. Any Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instanton with non-Euclidean volume growth is one of the following: the Kerr family, the Chen-Teo family, the Taub-bolt space, the reversed Taub-NUT space. This particularly confirms a conjecture by Aksteiner-Andersson. It includes the well-known Kerr family from general relativity.
  3. All Hermitian non-K\"ahler gravitational instantons can be compactified to log del Pezzo surfaces. This explains a curious relation to compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds.
  For a 4-dimensional Ricci-flat metric, being Hermitian non-K\"ahler is equivalent to being non-trivially conformally K\"ahler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying Serrin's overdetermined problems in Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds endowed with a conformal vector field, we prove a Pohozoaev-type identity to show a Serrin's type rigidity result using the P-function approach introduced by Weinberger. We proceed with a conformal change to achieve this goal, starting from a geometric Pohozaev identity due to Schoen. Moreover, we obtain a symmetry result for the associated Dirichlet problem by using a generalized normalized wall shear stress bound.</description>

      <title>Programming evolution of geometry in shape-morphing sheets via spatiotemporal activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape-programmed sheets morph from one surface into another upon activation by stimuli such as illumination, and have attracted much interest for their potential engineering applications, especially in soft robotics. Complex shape changes can be achieved by patterning a simple local active deformation (e.g. isotropic swelling), to generate differential growth. Usually the material itself is designed $\unicode{x2014}$ for example by patterning a molecular director $\unicode{x2014}$ such that a particular shape change occurs upon exposure to a spatially uniform stimulus. A limitation of this paradigm is that typically only one target geometry can be attained as the stimulus is adjusted. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by patterning the stimulus itself, thereby exercising spatiotemporal control over local deformation magnitudes. Thus a single physical sample can be induced to traverse a continuous family of target geometries, opening the door to precise shape adjustments, new functionalities, and designable non-reciprocal loops in shape space. We illustrate these possibilities with examples including active parabolic reflectors, chiral flow guides, and bending channels. Finding the necessary patterns of activation involves solving families of metric inverse problems; we solve these by reduction to ODEs in an axisymmetric setting, then present a novel numerical scheme to solve them in generality.</description>

The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>
