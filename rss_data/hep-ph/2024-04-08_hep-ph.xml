      <title>Exploring the Frontiers: Challenges and Theories Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) forms the bedrock of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, a powerful framework that delineates the fundamental constituents and interactions of the universe. However, the SM's narrative is incomplete, as it conspicuously fails to account for several empirical phenomena that challenge our current understanding of particle physics. This review meticulously examines three paramount anomalies that elude SM predictions: the elusive nature of dark matter, the Higgs boson's anomalously low mass, and the intricate puzzle of neutrino masses. Through a critical analysis, it delves into the forefront of theoretical advancements proposed to bridge these gaps, notably the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Supersymmetry (SUSY), and the intriguing hypothesis of right-handed neutrinos. By synthesizing current research and theoretical models, this review not only elucidates these profound mysteries but also underscores the imperative for a more comprehensive and unified theory of particle physics, setting the stage for future discoveries and theoretical breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Target normal single-spin asymmetry in inclusive electron-nucleon scattering in the 1/Nc expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target normal single-spin asymmetry in electron nucleon scattering is studied in the framework of the 1/Nc expansion of QCD, which allows for a rigorous description in the energy range that includes the Delta resonance and below the second baryon resonance region. The asymmetry is driven by the absorptive part of the two-photon exchange component of the scattering amplitude, being therefore the most unambiguous two-photon exchange effect. Such amplitude is shown to be described up to the next to leading order in the 1/Nc expansion only in terms of the charge and magnetic form factors of the nucleons, consequence of the approximate $SU(4)$ spin flavor symmetry valid in the large Nc limit for baryons. A discussion is provided of the 1/Nc expansion framework along with the results for the asymmetries in elastic, inelastic, and inclusive electron-nucleon scattering.</description>

      <title>CYG$\nu$S: Detecting solar neutrinos with directional gas time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CYGNUS is a proposed global network of large-scale gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with the capability of directionally detecting nuclear and electron recoils at $\gtrsim$keV energies. The primary focus of CYGNUS so far has been the detection of dark matter, with directional sensitivity providing a means of circumventing the so-called neutrino fog. However, the excellent background rejection and electron/nuclear recoil discrimination provided by directionality could turn the solar neutrino background into an interesting signal in its own right. For example, directionality would facilitate the simultaneous spectroscopy of multiple different flux sources. Here, we evaluate the possibility of measuring solar neutrinos using the same network of gas TPCs built from $10$ m$^3$-scale modules operating under conditions that enable simultaneous sensitivity to both dark matter and neutrinos. We focus in particular on electron recoils, which provide access to low-energy neutrino fluxes like $pp$, $pep$, $^7$Be, and CNO. An appreciable event rate is already detectable in experiments consisting of a single $10$ m$^3$ module, assuming standard fill gases such as CF$_4$ mixed with helium at atmospheric pressure. With total volumes around 1000 m$^3$ or higher, the TPC network could be complementary to dedicated neutrino observatories, whilst entering the dark-matter neutrino fog via the nuclear recoil channel. We evaluate the required directional performance and background conditions to observe, discriminate, and perform spectroscopy on neutrino events. We find that, under reasonable projections for planned technology that will enable 10--30-degree angular resolution and $\sim 10$\% fractional energy resolution, CYGNUS could be a competitive directional neutrino experiment.</description>

      <title>Re-assessing special aspects of Dirac fermions in presence of Lorentz-symmetry violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on additional inspections concerning the fermionic sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). In this context, our main effort in this contribution is to investigate effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) on the Klein Paradox, the Zitterbewegung and its phenomenology in connection to Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic Physics, and Astrophysics. Finally, we discuss a particular realization of LSV in the Dirac equation, considering an asymmetry between space and time due to a scale factor present in the linear momentum of the fermion, but which does not touch its time derivative. We go further and extend the implications of this asymmetry in the situation the scale factor becomes space-time dependent to compute its influence on the kinematics of the Compton effect with the extended dispersion relation for the fermion that scatters the photon.</description>

      <title>A new 700 GeV scalar in the LHC data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative to the metastability of the electroweak vacuum, resulting from perturbative calculations, one can consider a non-perturbative effective potential which, as at the beginning of the Standard Model, is restricted to the pure $\Phi^4$ sector yet consistent with the known analytical and numerical studies. In this approach, where the electroweak vacuum is now the lowest-energy state, besides the resonance of mass $m_h=$ 125 GeV defined by the quadratic shape of the potential at its minimum, the Higgs field should exhibit a second resonance with mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor}=690\,(30)$ GeV associated with the zero-point energy determining the potential depth. In spite of its large mass, this resonance would couple to longitudinal $W$s with the same typical strength as the low-mass state at 125 GeV and represent a relatively narrow resonance, mainly produced at LHC by gluon-gluon fusion.
  In this Letter, we review LHC data suggesting a new resonance of mass $(M_H)^{\rm EXP} \sim 682\,(10)$ GeV, with a statistical significance that is far from negligible.</description>

      <title>Dimension-eight Operator Basis for Universal Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the basis of dimension-eight operators associated with universal theories. We first derive a complete list of independent dimension-eight operators formed with the Standard Model bosonic fields characteristic of such universal new physics scenarios. Without imposing C or P symmetries the basis contains 175 operators -- that is, the assumption of Universality reduces the number of independent SMEFT coefficients at dimension eight from 44807 to 175. 89 of the 175 universal operators are included in the general dimension-eight operator basis in the literature. The 86 additional operators involve higher derivatives of the Standard Model bosonic fields and can be rotated in favor of operators involving fermions using the Standard Model equations of motion for the bosonic fields. By doing so we obtain the allowed fermionic operators generated in this class of models which we map into the corresponding 86 independent combinations of operators in the dimension-eight basis of Ref. arXiv:2005.00059</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays $D \to A(A \to VP)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ with the SU(3) flavor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semileptonic three-body $D \to A\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays, nonleptonic $A \to VP$ decays and semileptonic four-body $D \to A(A \to VP)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ strong or electromagnetic decays are analyzed by the SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where $A$ denotes the axial-vector meson, $V$ denotes the vector meson, and $P$ denotes pseudoscalar meson. In terms of the SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, the decay amplitudes of the $D \to A \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ decays or the vertex coefficients of the $A \to VP$ decays are related. The relevant nonperturbative parameters are constrained by the present experimental data. Then the branching ratios of the $D \to A \ell^+ \nu_\ell $, $A \to VP$ and $D\to A(A\to VP)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are predicted by the constrained parameters. We find that some branching ratios are large and they might be measured in the near future experiments. Moreover, the sensitivities of the branching ratios of $D \to A \ell^+ \nu_\ell $ and $A \to VP$ decays to the parameters are also shown, and some decay branching ratios are sensitive to the nonperturbative parameters.</description>

      <title>Photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ off a proton in the threshold region, in terms of C-odd gluonic correlations in the off-forward proton matrix element. Near threshold, the skewness is large leading to a production amplitude that is dominated by four C-odd twist-3 gluon GPDs. We use the QCD instanton vacuum to estimate these C-odd contributions in the proton. The results are used to estimate the differential cross sections for coherent photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ in the threshold region, at current electron facilities.</description>

      <title>Poles and Poltergeists in $e^+ e^- \to D \bar D$ Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent report of $e^+ e^- \to D\bar D$ events by the BESIII Collaboration suggests the presence of a structure $R$ at 3900~MeV\@. We argue that this structure, called $G(3900)$ in the past, is not in fact due to a new $c\bar c$ resonance, but rather naturally emerges as a threshold enhancement due to the opening of the $D^*\bar D$ channel. We further find that the appearance of this structure does not require suppression because of a radial node in the $\psi(4040)$ wave function, although a node improves fit quality. The measured $e^+ e^-$ coupling of $\psi(4040)$ is found to be substantially smaller than previously estimated. In addition, we report new corrections to the measured cross section $\sigma(e^+ e^- \to D\bar D)$ at energies near $\psi(3770)$.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Matter with Forbidden Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dark matter model based on QCD-like $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with electroweakly interacting dark quarks is discussed. Assuming the dark quark mass $m$ is smaller than the dynamical scale $\Lambda_d \sim 4\pi f_d$, the main component of the dark matter is the lightest $G$-parity odd dark pion associated with chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector. We show that nonzero dark quark mass induces the universal mass contribution to both $G$-parity odd and even pions, and their masses tend to be degenerate. As a result, dark pion annihilation into heavier $G$-parity even dark pion also affects the dark matter relic abundance. Thus, our setup naturally accommodates forbidden dark matter scenario and realizes heavy dark matter whose mass is ${\cal O}(1$-$100)~{\rm TeV}$, which is different from conventional electroweakly interacting dark matter such as minimal dark matter. We also discuss CP-violation from $\theta$-term in the dark gauge sector and find that the predicted size of electron electric dipole moment can be as large as $\sim 10^{-32}~e~{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Flavor-spin symmetry of the $P^N_{\psi}/H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N$ and $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}/H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$ molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a contact lagrangian that incorporates the SU(3) flavor and SU(2) spin symmetries, we discuss the symmetry properties of the interactions among the heavy flavor meson-baryon $P_{\psi}^N$, $P_{\psi s}^\Lambda$ (with quark components [$n\bar{c}$][$nnc$], [$s\bar{c}$][$nnc$], or [$n\bar{c}$][$nsc$]) systems and di-baryon $H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N$, $H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$ (with quark components [$nnc$][$ncc$], [$nnc$][$scc$] or [$nsc$][$ncc$]) systems ($n=u$, $d$). The light quark components of the $P_{\psi}^N$ ($P_{\psi s}^\Lambda$) and $H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N$ ($H_{\Omega_{ccc}s}^\Lambda$) systems have identical flavors, the interactions generated from the exchanges of light mesons in the $P_{\psi}^N$ ($P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$) systems should be very similar to that of the $H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N$ ($H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$) systems. We perform the single-channel and multi-channel calculations on the $P_{\psi}^N/P^\Lambda_{\psi s}/H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N/H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$ systems and introduce the SU(3) breaking effect to identify the different mass spectra among the $P_{\psi}^N$ ($H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N$) and $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}$ ($H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$) systems. We suggest two kinds of evidences for the existence of the flavor-spin symmetry among the heavy flavor $P_{\psi}^N/H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N/P^\Lambda_{\psi s}/H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$ molecule community, i.e., the mass arrangements of the $P_{\psi}^N/H_{\Omega_{ccc}}^N/P^\Lambda_{\psi s}/H^{\Lambda}_{\Omega_{ccc}s}$ mass spectra and the binding energies of the heavy flavor meson-baryon (di-baryon) systems attributed to the same contact potentials.</description>

      <title>Vacuum correlations of the stress-energy-momentum tensor with constituent quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two point correlation function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor describes the propagation of a space-time "micro-earthquake" in the vacuum. In the framework of the path integral formulation of field theory in curved space-time, we derive the Ward-Takashi identity for two-point Green's function of the stress-energy-momentum tensor for a general case of a non-conformal theory. The identity constrains the longitudinal part of the correlator, with the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy-momentum, non-zero in a non-conformal theory. The obtained formula is demonstrated on the free massive Dirac fermion theory, treated at the one-loop level. This example befits a class of phenomenological chiral quarks models which have been used successfully in numerous applications in the soft non-perturbative regime of strong interactions. We discuss the constraints following from the Ward-Takahashi identity for the correlation functions in these models. We also show how the temporal representation of the two-point correlators, which is an object amenable to lattice QCD, displays an expected exponential fall-off.</description>

      <title>Strangeness $+1$ light multiquark baryons: a jinx?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the renewing experimental interest for searching strangeness $+1$ baryons at J-PARC, we study the existence of light baryon resonances with strangeness +1 generated in the $K$-$(N^*/\Delta^*)$ system, where $N^*$ represents either $N^*(1535)$/$N^*(1650)$/$N^*(1700)$, and $\Delta^*$ corresponds to $\Delta(1620)$. The description of the properties of the aforementioned states requires considering the dynamics involved in the coupled pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon systems with strangeness $S=0$ in the s-wave. For the purpose of our current study, we consider the pseudoscalar-baryon (PB) and vector-baryon channels (VB) to which the mentioned $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances couple and solve the Faddeev equations for the coupled channel system $K$-$\text{PB}$, $K$-$\text{VB}$, with all interactions being in the s-wave. Despite some strong attraction present in two of the subsystems, we do not find clear evidence supporting the formation of strangeness +1 states, with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$, in the energy region $2000-2200$ MeV. However, the case of spin-parity $J^P=3/2^+$ seems more promising, showing the formation of a resonance with a mass around 2167 MeV, with a width of 90-100 MeV. We suggest that a signal of such a state could be found in processes with final states like $KN$, $K^*(892) N$.</description>

      <title>Center-of-mass energy dependence of intrinsic-$k_T$ distributions obtained from Drell-Yan production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal motion of partons inside hadrons has been studied through its impact on very low transverse momentum spectra of Drell-Yan (DY) pairs created in hadron-hadron collisions. We study DY production at next-to-leading order using the Parton Branching (PB) method which describes the evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. The main focus is on studying the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution (intrinsic-$k_T$) as a function of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s$. While collinear parton shower Monte Carlo event generators require intrinsic transverse momentum distributions strongly dependent on $\sqrt s$, this is not the case for the PB method. We perform a detailed study of the impact of soft parton emissions. We show that by requiring a minimal transverse momentum, $q_0$, of a radiated parton, a dependence of the width of the intrinsic-$k_T$ distribution as a function of $\sqrt{s}$ is observed. This dependence becomes stronger with increasing $q_0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum radiation reaction: Analytical approximations and obtaining the spectrum from moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical $\chi\ll1$ approximations for spin-dependent quantum radiation reaction for locally constant and locally monochromatic fields. We show how to factor out fast spin oscillations and obtain the degree of polarization in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field from the Frobenius norm of the Mueller matrix. We show that spin effects lead to a transseries in $\chi$, with powers $\chi^k$, logarithms $(\ln\chi)^k$ and oscillating terms, $\cos(\dots/\chi)$ and $\sin(\dots/\chi)$. In our approach we can obtain each moment, $\langle(kP)^m\rangle$, of the lightfront longitudinal momentum independently of the other moments and without considering the spectrum. We show how to obtain a low-energy expansion of the spectrum from the moments by treating $m$ as a continuous, complex parameter and performing an inverse Mellin transform. We also show how to obtain the spectrum, without making a low-energy approximation, from a handful of moments using the principle of maximum entropy.</description>

      <title>Jet angularities in dijet production in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study jet angularities for dijet production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in proton-proton (pp) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at 200 GeV nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass collision energy. In particular, we provide $\mathrm{NLL}$ resummed predictions for angularity observables of groomed and ungroomed jets produced in $\rm pp$ collisions matched to next-to-leading order QCD calculations resulting in $\mathrm{NLO+NLL^\prime}$ accuracy. Our parton-level predictions are corrected for non-perturbative effects, such as hadronization and underlying event, using parton-to-hadron level transfer matrices obtained with the Sherpa event generator. Furthermore, we use the Q-Pythia and JEWEL generators to estimate the impact of the interaction between quarks and gluons produced by the parton shower with the dense medium formed in heavy-ion collisions on the considered jet angularities.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit entanglement in the Color Glass Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spin-orbit correlations of quarks and gluons at small-$x$ and show that the helicity and the orbital angular momentum of individual partons are strongly anti-aligned even in unpolarized or spinless hadrons and nuclei. Combined with the fact that gluons in the Color Glass Condensate are linearly polarized, our finding indicates that the helicity and the orbital angular momentum of single gluons are maximally entangled in a quantum mechanical sense.</description>

      <title>Exploring orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit correlation for gluons at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 182002 (2022)], we introduced a pioneering observable aimed at experimentally detecting the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of gluons. Our focus was on the longitudinal double spin asymmetry observed in exclusive dijet production during electron-proton scattering. We demonstrated the sensitivity of the $\cos \phi$ angular correlation between the scattered electron and proton as a probe for gluon OAM at small-$x$ and its intricate interplay with gluon helicity. This current work provides a comprehensive exposition, diving further into the aforementioned calculation with added elaboration and in-depth analysis. We reveal that, in addition to the gluon OAM, one also gains access to the spin-orbit correlation of gluons. We supplement our work with a detailed numerical analysis of our observables for the kinematics of the Electron-Ion Collider. In addition to dijet production, we also consider the recently proposed semi-inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering process which potentially offers experimental advantages over dijet measurements. Finally, we investigate quark-channel contributions to these processes and find an unexpected breakdown of collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Gauge Group, SMEFT, and Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss heavy particles that can be used to pin down the faithful Standard Model (SM) gauge group and their patterns in the SM effective field theory (SMEFT). These heavy particles are not invariant under a specific $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which however acts trivially on all the SM particles, hence the faithful SM gauge group remains undetermined. Different realizations of the faithful SM gauge group correspond to different spectra of heavy particles, and they also correspond to distinct sets of line operators with one-form global symmetry acting on them. We show that the heavy particles not invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group cannot appear in tree-level ultraviolet completions of SMEFT, this enforces us to consider one-loop UV completions of SMEFT to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. We demonstrate with examples that correlations between Wilson coefficients provide an efficient way to examine models with $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. Finally, we prove that all the scalars that can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking must be invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group, hence they cannot be used to probe the faithful SM gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate anthropic prediction of dark matter abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main goals in the study of hadronic interactions at LHC energies is the attempt to characterize the mechanisms involved in particle production in different regimes. The charged-particle multiplicity is one of the most interesting observables in these kind of studies. Measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity densities in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}}$ = 13.6 TeV are presented, for the first time. Furthermore, we present a method for better understanding the collision dynamics. On the one hand, the pseudorapidity dependence of charged-particle production provides information on the partonic structure of the colliding hadrons and is sensitive to non-linear QCD evolution in the initial state. On the other hand to understand the thermal-like behavior and particle yields in pp collisions, a possible approach is to address the principles of quantum states and their entanglement in the produced system. The entanglement in the initial state has a measurable effect on the evolution of the system and is the driving mechanism behind the thermal-like behavior and particle yields observed. We describe a method to understand the level of entanglement in the initial and final states of the collision using a calculation of entropy, the final-state entropy being calculated from multiplicity distributions.</description>

      <title>Structure and Complexity of Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators capture the spatial fluctuations imprinted during the earliest episodes of the universe. While they are generally very non-trivial functions of the kinematic variables, they are known to arise as solutions to special sets of differential equations. In this work we use this fact to uncover the underlying tame structure for such correlators and argue that they admit a well-defined notion of complexity. In particular, building upon the recently proposed kinematic flow algorithm, we show that tree-level cosmological correlators of a generic scalar field theory in an FLRW spacetime belong to the class of Pfaffian functions. Since Pfaffian functions admit a notion of complexity, we can give explicit bounds on the topological and computational complexity of cosmological correlators. We conclude with some speculative comments on the general tame structures capturing all cosmological correlators and the connection between complexity and the emergence of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the necessary formation of molecular hydrogen is supressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some or all of the dark matter could successfully lead to the direct collapse of a SMBH.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Rastall Gravity: from low-mass HESS J1731-347 to high-mass PSR J0952-0607 pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to Rastall gravity we introduce matter-geometry nonminimal coupling which is proportional to the gradient of quadratic curvature invariants. Those are mimicking the conformal trace anomaly when backreaction of the quantum fields to a curved spacetime geometry is considered. We consider a static spherically symmetric stellar structure with anisotropic fluid and Krori-Barua metric potentials model to examine the theory. Confronting the model with NICER+XMM-Newton observational constraints on the pulsar PSR J0740$+$6620 quantifies the amount of the nonminimal coupling via a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon\simeq -0.01$. We verify that the conformal symmetry is broken everywhere inside the pulsar as the trace anomaly $\Delta&gt;0$, or equivalently the trace of the stress-energy tensor $\mathfrak{T}&lt;0$, whereas the adiabatic sound speed does not violate the conjecture conformal upper limit $v_r^2/c^2 = 1/3$. The maximum compactness accordingly is $C_\text{max}=0.752$ which is $4\%$ higher than GR. Notably, if the conformal sound speed constraint is hold, observational data excludes $\epsilon \geq 0$ up to $\geq 1.6\sigma$. The stellar model is consistent with the self-bound structure with soft linear equation of state. Investigating possible connection with MIT bag model of strange quarks sets physical bounds from microscopic physics which confirm the negative value of the parameter $\epsilon$. We estimate a radius $R=13.21 \pm 0.96$ km of the most massive observed compact star PSR J0952$-$0607 with $M=2.35\pm0.17 M_\odot$. Finally, we show that the corresponding mass-radius diagram fits well lowest-mass pulsar HESS J1731$-$347 and highest-mass pulsar PSR J0952$-$0607 ever observed as well as the intermediate mass range as obtained by NICER and LIGO/Virgo observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a mechanism for producing the baryon asymmetry and dark matter in models with multiple hidden sectors that are Standard-Model-like but with varying Higgs mass parameters. If the field responsible for reheating the Standard Model and the exotic sectors carries an asymmetry, it can be converted into a baryon asymmetry using the standard sphaleron process. A hidden sector with positive Higgs mass squared can accommodate dark matter with its baryon asymmetry, and the larger abundance of dark matter relative to baryons is due to dark sphalerons being active all the way down the hidden sector QCD scale. This scenario predicts that dark matter is clustered in large dark nuclei and gives a lower bound on the effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.05$, which may be observable in the next-generation cosmic microwave background experiment CMB-S4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent open quantum system studies showed that quarkonium time evolution inside the quark-gluon plasma is determined by transport coefficients that are defined in terms of a gauge invariant correlator of two chromoelectric field operators connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We study the Euclidean version of the correlator for quarkonium evolution and discuss the extraction of the transport coefficients from this Euclidean correlator, highlighting its difference from other problems that also require reconstructing a spectral function, such as the calculation of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Along the way, we explain why the transport coefficient $\gamma_{\rm adj}$ differs from $\gamma_{\rm fund}$ at finite temperature at $\mathcal{O}(g^4)$, in spite of the fact that their corresponding spectral functions differ only by a temperature-independent term at the same order. We then discuss how to evaluate the Euclidean correlator via lattice QCD methods, with a focus on reducing the uncertainty caused by infrared renormalons in determining the renormalization factor nonperturbatively.</description>

      <title>Open charm production cross section from combined LHC experiments in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open charm production in proton-proton collisions represents an important tool to investigate some of the most fundamental aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics, from the partonic mechanisms of heavy-quark production to the process of heavy-quark hadronisation. Over the last decade, the measurement of the production cross sections of charm mesons and baryons in proton-proton (pp) collisions was at the centre of a wide experimental effort at the Large Hadron Collider. Thanks to the complementarity of the different experiments, the production of charm hadrons was measured over a wide transverse momentum region and in different rapidity ranges. In this paper, the measurements of the charm hadrons $D^0$, $D^*$, $D^+$, $D_s^+$, $\Lambda_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ performed by the ALICE, CMS and LHCb collaborations in pp collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=\rm 5.02~TeV$ are combined to determine the total charm-quark production cross section $\sigma_{c\overline{c}}$ in a novel data-driven approach. The resulting total $c\overline{c}$ cross section is \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  \sigma_\mathrm{c\overline{c}} (\mathrm{pp},5.02\,\mathrm{TeV}) ={} &amp; 8340.9 \pm 217.8\mathrm{ (stat.) }
  {}^{+367.1}_{-367.2} \mathrm{ (syst.) }
  {}^{+362.5}_{-457.5} \mathrm{ (extr.) }
  + 679.9 (\Omega_\mathrm{c})~\mu\mathrm{b}. \end{aligned} \end{equation*} The measured charm-hadron distributions and corresponding cross sections are compared with the most recent theoretical calculations.</description>

Abstract: Color flux tubes are a standard perspective from which to understand stopping in high-energy collisions. Mechanisms for baryon transport and polarization within a tube are considered here, both in regards to the the transport of baryons from the target and projectile toward mid-rapidity, and in regards to the correlations of baryon-antibaryon pairs created in the tube. The roles of tube merging and gluon radiation with a tube are emphasized.</description>

      <title>A Possible Solution to the Difficulty in the Interpretation of Deuteron Compositeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the theoretical structure of compositeness with explicit energy dependence, and find a possible explanation for the difficulty in the interpretation of compositeness of deuteron. Compositeness of deuteron is calculated as larger than one in many methods like weak-binding limit. Even though it is widely assumed that the energy dependence in interaction always comes from other states, which we call surjective interpretation, we find that the outcome of deuteron may suggest a violation of surjective interpretation. We directly perform numerical and perturbative calculations of deuteron compositeness. It is concluded that if the energy dependent part of interaction contributes to attraction, compositeness is likely to be enhanced from unity. We discuss the indications of this outcome and the model dependence of compositeness. We propose a straightforward extension and a thorough revise on the formalism of compositeness with field theory considerations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to construct the qT distribution at NLO accuracy to arbitrary power precision, including the assembly of suitable zero-bin subtrahends, in a mathematically well-defined way for a generic choice of rapidity-divergence regularisation prescription. In its derivation, we divide the phase space into two sectors, the interior of the integration domain as well as the integration boundary, which we include here for the first time. To demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our algorithm, we calculate the NNLP corrections for Higgs hadroproduction for the first time. We observe that our approximate NNLP-accurate qT spectra replicate the asymptotic behaviour of the full QCD calculation to a much better degree than the previously available results, both within the $q_{\mathrm{T}}\to 0$ limit and in the large-qT domain for all the involved partonic processes. While playing a minor role at larger transverse momenta, we show that the newly incorporated boundary contribution plays a vital role in the $q_{\mathrm{T}}\to 0$ limit, where any subleading power accuracy would be lost without them. In particular, our NNLP-accurate qT expansion can approximate the exact qT distribution up to $q_{\mathrm{T}}\sim30\,\text{GeV}$ at the percent level for rapidities $|Y_H|\lesssim 3$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic solar Primakoff process</title>

Abstract: The Primakoff mechanism is one of the primary channels for the production of solar axion. In canonical estimation of the Primakoff photon-axion conversion rate, the recoil effect is neglected and a static structure factor is adopted. By use of the linear response theory, we provide a dynamic description of the solar Primakoff process. It is found that the collective electrons overtake ions as the dominant factor, in contrast to the static screening picture where ions contribute more to the photon-axion conversion. Nonetheless, the resulting axion flux is only 1-2% lower than the standard estimate based on the static structure factor.</description>

      <title>SIDIS at small $x$ at next-to-leading order: gluon contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of identified particles production in oxygen-oxygen collisions at \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}} = 7 TeV using EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aims to inject oxygen (${}^{16}O$) ions in the next run into its experiments. This include the anticipated one-day physics run focusing on $OO$ collisions at center-of-mass energy \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}} = 7 Tev. In this study, we have used recently developed version of the EPOS model (EPOS4) to study the production of identified particles ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\overline{p})$) in $OO$ collisions at 7 Tev. Predictions of transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, $\langle p_T \rangle$, integrated yield (dN/dy) for different centrality classes are studied. To provide insight into the collective nature of the produced particles, we look into the $p_T$-differential particle ratios ($K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$) and $p_T$-integrated particle ratios to ($\pi^++\pi^-$) as a function of charge particle multiplicity. The shape of the charge particle multiplicity ($dN/d\eta$) and $\langle p_T \rangle$ is well described by the EPOS4. The EPOS4 model predictions for the ratios of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ exhibit a systematic overestimation compared to the observed trends as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. Interestingly, the $OO$ results of $p_T$-integrated particle ratios shows a clear final state multiplicity overlap with $pp$, $p-Pb$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions. EPOS4 mimics signs of collectivity and is one of the suitable candidates to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the foreseen data from $OO$ collisions at the LHC, when available, will help to better understand the heavy-ion-like behavior in small systems as well as help to put possible constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the urgent issues in high energy physics is the experimental confirmation of the electroweak monopole predicted by the standard model, and currently MoEDAL at LHC is actively searching for the monopole. However, the present LHC cannot produce the monopole if the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, while the monopole mass is expected to be around $M_W/\alpha \simeq 11~\text{TeV}$. In this paper we discuss how LHC could circumbent this energy constraint and produce the monopole even when the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, based on the following ideas. First, in the topological production of the monopole the baby monopole mass at creation could be considerably smaller than the adolescent mass. Second, the binding energy of the monopole-antimonopole pair could effectively reduce the mass of the bound state. We discuss how these ideas can actually be realized at LHC to produce the monopole pairs. In particular, we argue that LHC could produce the baby electroweak monopoles whose mass could be around 5.3 TeV, smaller than the adolescent monopole mass around 11.0 TeV. Moreover, we show that LHC could produce the monopolium bound state with mass around 2.5 TeV, even when the total mass of the monopole-antimonopole pair is around 10.6 TeV. Our analysis could play an important role for MoEDAL experiment.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-covariant spinor wave packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formulation of manifestly Lorentz-covariant spinor wave-packet basis. The conventional definition of the spinor wave packet is problematic in the sense that it suffers from mixing with other wave packets under Lorentz transformations. Our formulation evades this difficulty of mixing. This wave packet forms a complete set that can expand a free spinor field in a Lorentz covariant manner. In addition, we present a Lorentz-invariant expression of zero-point energy.</description>

      <title>Lattice investigations of the chimera baryon spectrum in the Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of lattice numerical studies of the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to fermions (hyperquarks) transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations of the gauge group. This strongly-coupled theory is the minimal candidate for the ultraviolet completion of composite Higgs models that facilitate the mechanism of partial compositeness for generating the top-quark mass. We measure the spectrum of the low-lying, half-integer spin, bound states composed of two fundamental and one antisymmetric hyperquarks, dubbed chimera baryons, in the quenched approximation. In this first systematic, non-perturbative study, we focus on the three lightest parity-even chimera-baryon states, in analogy with QCD, denoted as $\Lambda_{\rm CB}$, $\Sigma_{\rm CB}$ (both with spin 1/2), and $\Sigma_{\rm CB}^\ast$(with spin 3/2). The spin-1/2 such states are candidates of the top partners. The extrapolation of our results to the continuum and massless-hyperquark limit is performed using formulae inspired by QCD heavy-baryon Wilson chiral perturbation theory. Within the range of hyperquark masses in our simulations, we find that $\Sigma_{\mathrm{CB}}$ is not heavier than $\Lambda_{\mathrm{CB}}$.</description>
