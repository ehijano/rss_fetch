      <title>Best Proximity Point Results for Perimetric Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two aims, first one is to introduce special kind of proximal contractions guaranteeing a finite number of best proximity points, and second one is to derive best proximity point results for perimetric contractions. To meet these two aims, we introduce two new proximal contractions: perimetric proximal contractions of the first and the second kind, and derive best proximity point results for these mappings. We establish that for these particular mappings, best proximity points are not necessarily unique; however, we provide an upper bound, proving that at most two such points can exist. To establish the validity of our results, we provide illustrative examples demonstrating that these newly defined mappings can possess unique or exactly two best proximity points.</description>

      <title>The Cofinality of Generating Familes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of a separable metrizable space $M$ is \emph{generated} by a family $\mathcal{C}$ of its subsets provided that a set $A\subseteq M$ is closed in $M$ if and only if $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$ for each $C\in \mathcal{C}$. The \emph{sequentiality number}, $\mathop{seq}(M)$, and \emph{$k$-ness number}, $\mathop{k}(M)$, of $M$, are the minimum size of a generating family of convergent sequences, respectively compact subsets.
  Let $\mathfrak{b}$ be the minimum size of an unbounded set in $\omega^\omega$ with the mod finite order. For a cardinal $\kappa$, the \emph{sampling number}, $\mathop{sam}(\kappa)$, is the least number of countable subsets of $\kappa$ needed to have infinite intersection with every countably-infinite subset of $\kappa$. It is shown using the Tukey order on relations that (1) $\mathop{seq}(M)=\mathop{sam}(|M|)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$, unless $M$ is locally small (every point of $M$ has a neighborhood of size strictly less than $|M|$) in which case $\mathop{seq}(M)=\lim_{\mu &lt;|M|} \mathop{sam}(\mu)\cdot \mathfrak{b}$ and (2) $k(M)$ is in the interval $[kc(M)\cdot\mathfrak{b},\mathop{sam}(kc(M))\cdot \mathfrak{b}]$, where $kc(M)$ is the minimum number of compact sets that cover $M$. Shelah's \emph{PCF} theory is shown to provide tools to bound the sampling number, specifically, the covering number bounds from above, while mod finite scales give lower bounds.
  Solutions to problems of van Douwen's on the $k$-ness number of analytic and of co-analytic spaces are deduced.</description>

      <title>On non-Hausdorff manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this long note, we investigate various purely topological aspects of non-Hausdorff manifolds (NH-manifolds for short). Our emphasis is on manifolds which exhibit homogeneity or weakenings thereof, in particular being everywhere non-Hausdorff. Homogeneous NH-manifolds and everywhere non-Hausdorff manifolds are respectively called HNH- and ENH-manifolds. We write $NH_X(x)$ for the subset of points of a space $X$ which cannot be separated of $x$ by open sets. The topics covered in this note are the following.
  -- General (basic) properties of manifolds and their quasi-compact or quasi-countably compact subspaces.
  -- Covering properties implying the Hausdorffness of (weakly) homogeneous manifolds.
  -- (Non-)existence of hereditarily separable ENH-manifolds (sometimes under set theoretic hypotheses).
  -- Non-existence of a quasi-countably compact ENH-manifold.
  -- Properties of NH-manifolds which imply that $NH_M(x)$ is discrete, or at least ``simple''.
  -- Constructions of HNH-manifolds such that $NH(x)$ is non-homogeneous, for instance a countable union of closed intervals and $n$-torii.
  -- Constructions of NH-manifolds $M$ with a point $x$ such that $NH_M(x)$ is homeomorphic to various ``complicated'' spaces, in particular in dimension $1$ and $2$.
  We use elementary (or at least well known) methods of general or set theoretic topology, with a little bit of conformal theory and dynamical systems (flows) in some constructions. Many pictures are given to illustrate the constructions, and the proofs are rather detailed, which is the main reason for the length of this note.</description>

      <title>On Quasi-Modular Pseudometric Spaces and Asymmetric Uniformities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-modular pseudometric spaces as asymmetric refinements of modular metric structures. To each such space we associate canonical forward and backward quasi-uniformities and the corresponding directional topologies.
  We introduce directional notions of convergence, completeness, total boundedness, and compactness, and show that these properties are not preserved under symmetrization. In particular, forward and backward completeness may differ, and compactness of the symmetrized uniformity does not imply directional compactness.
  Using enriched category theory as a comparison framework, we show that symmetrization yields a symmetric enriched category whose Cauchy completion coincides with the classical uniform completion, while directional notions remain invisible at this level.</description>

      <title>Super-Dense Sets and Their Role in the Theory of Normal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15422v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new topological notion of the size for subsets of the real line, called \emph{super-density}. A set $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ is super-dense if for every non-empty open interval $I$ and every nowhere constant continuous function $\varphi\colon I\to\mathbb{R}$, we have $\varphi(I\cap A)\cap A\neq\emptyset$. We first establish basic properties of super-dense sets. Our main topological result characterizes them within the framework of Baire category: a set with the Baire property is super-dense if and only if it is co-meager. We then investigate the implications for the theory of normal numbers. We prove that the set of non-normal numbers is super-dense, whereas the set of normal numbers is not. Consequently, no nowhere constant continuous function can map all non-normal numbers to normal numbers. Conversely, we explicitly construct a computable nowhere constant continuous function that maps all normal numbers to non-normal numbers. Finally, we provide a constructive algorithm that, given any countable family of nowhere constant continuous functions, produces a real number $x$ such that $x$ and all its images under these functions are non-normal. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a non-normal number $x$ such that $e^{\alpha x}$ is non-normal for every non-zero algebraic $\alpha$.</description>
