      <title>On CLT and non-CLT groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that for every integer $d\geq 2$ which is not a prime power, there exists a finite solvable group $G$ such that $d\mid |G|$, $\pi(G)=\pi(d)$ and $G$ has no subgroup of order $d$. We also introduce the CLT-degree of a finite group and answer two questions about it.</description>

Abstract: We construct two non-discrete inverse semigroup $T_1$-topologies and a compact inverse shift-continuous $T_1$-topologe on the bicyclic monoid ${\mathscr{C}}(p,q)$. Also we give conditions on a $T_1$-topology $\tau$ on ${\mathscr{C}}(p,q)$ to be discrete.</description>

      <title>Groups with supersolvable automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a finite group G ultrasolvable if it has a characteristic subgroup series whose factors are cyclic. It was shown by Durbin--McDonald that the automorphism group of an ultrasolvable group is supersolvable. The converse statement was established by Baartmans--Woeppel under the hypothesis that G has no direct factor isomorphic to the Klein four-group. We extend this result by proving that Aut(G) is supersolvable if and only if G is ultrasolvable or G=H\times C_2\times C_2 where H is ultrasolvable of odd order. This corrects an erroneous claim by Corsi Tani. Our proof is more elementary than Baartmans--Woeppel's and uses some ideas of Corsi Tani and Laue.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gottschalk's conjecture for sofic groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish generalizations of the well-known surjunctivity theorem of Gromov and Weiss as well as the dual-surjunctivity theorem of Capobianco, Kari and Taati for cellular automata (CA) to local perturbations of CA over sofic group universes. We also extend the results to a class of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) consisting of global perturbations with uniformly bounded singularity of CA. As an application, we obtain the surjunctivity of algebraic NUCA with uniformly bounded singularity over sofic groups. Moreover, we prove the stable finiteness of twisted group rings over sofic groups to generalize known results on Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture for group rings.</description>

      <title>A boundary for hyperbolic digraphs and semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a notion by Gray and Kambites of hyperbolicity in the setting of semimetric spaces like digraphs or semigroups, we will construct (under a small additional geometric assumption) a boundary based on quasi-geodesic rays and anti-rays that is preserved by quasi-isometries and, in the case of locally finite digraphs and right cancellative semigroups, refines their ends. Among other results, we show that it is possible to equip the space, if it is finitely based, together with its boundary with a pseudo-semimetric.</description>

      <title>Averaging operators on groups, racks and Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers averaging operators on various algebraic structures and studies the induced structures. We first introduce the notion of an averaging operator on a group $G$ and show that it induces a rack structure. Moreover, the given group structure and the induced rack structure form a group-rack. We observe that any pointed group-rack can be embedded into an averaging group. We show that the differentiation of a smooth pointed averaging operator on a Lie group gives rise to an averaging operator on the corresponding Lie algebra. Next, we consider averaging operators on a rack that induces a hierarchy of new rack structures. Moreover, any two racks with increasing hierarchy levels form a rack-pairing, a structure that is related to two-sided skew braces by conjugation. We also consider averaging operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras and braided vector spaces in relations to averaging operators on groups, Lie algebras and racks. In the end, we define averaging operators on a Leibniz algebra, find the induced structure and show that the differentiation of a smooth pointed averaging operator on a pointed Lie rack yields an averaging operator on the corresponding Leibniz algebra.</description>

      <title>SFT covers for actions of the first Grigorchuk group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symbolic dynamical representations of actions of the first Grigorchuk group $G$, namely its action on the boundary of the infinite rooted binary tree, its representation in the topological full group of a minimal substitutive $\mathbb{Z}$-shift, and its representation as a minimal system of Schreier graphs. We show that the first system admits an SFT cover, and the latter two systems are conjugate to sofic subshifts on $G$, but are not of finite type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Linear average-case complexity of algorithmic problems in groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05232v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The worst-case complexity of group-theoretic algorithms has been studied for a long time. Generic-case complexity, or complexity on random inputs, was introduced and studied relatively recently. In this paper, we address the average-case time complexity of the word problem in several classes of groups and show that it is often the case that the average-case complexity is linear with respect to the length of an input word. The classes of groups that we consider include groups of matrices over rationals (in particular, polycyclic groups), some classes of solvable groups, as well as free products. Along the way, we improve several bounds for the worst-case complexity of the word problem in groups of matrices, in particular in nilpotent groups. For free products, we also address the average-case complexity of the subgroup membership problem and show that it is often linear, too. Finally, we discuss complexity of the identity problem that has not been considered before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measure equivalence was introduced by Gromov as a measured analogue of quasi-isometry. Unlike the latter, measure equivalence does not preserve the large scale geometry of groups and happens to be very flexible in the amenable world. Indeed the Ornstein-Weiss theorem shows that all infinite countable amenable groups are measure equivalent to the group of integers. To refine this equivalence relation and make it responsive to geometry, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera introduced a quantitative version of measure equivalence. They also defined a relaxed version of this notion called quantitative measure subgroup coupling. In this article we offer to answer the inverse problem of the quantification (find a group admitting a measure subgroup coupling with a prescribed group with prescribed quantification) in the case of the lamplighter group.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy classes of derangements in finite groups of Lie type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite almost simple group of Lie type acting faithfully and primitively on a set $\Omega$. We prove an analogue of the Boston--Shalev conjecture for conjugacy classes: the proportion of conjugacy classes of $G$ consisting of derangements is bounded away from zero. This answers a question of Guralnick and Zalesski. The proof is based on results on the anatomy of palindromic polynomials over finite fields (with either reflective symmetry or conjugate-reflective symmetry).</description>

      <title>Hopf-Galois structures on separable field extensions of degree $pq$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2020, Alabdali and Byott described the Hopf-Galois structures arising on Galois field extensions of squarefree degree. Extending to squarefree separable, but not necessarily normal, extensions $L/K$ is a natural next step. One must consider now the interplay between two Galois groups $G=\operatorname{Gal}(E/K)$ and $G'=\operatorname{Gal}(E/L)$, where $E$ is the Galois closure of $L/K$. In this paper, we give a characterisation and enumeration of the Hopf-Galois structures arising on separable extensions of degree $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes. This work includes the results of Byott and Martin-Lyons who do likewise for the special case that $p=2q+1$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of roots up to conjugacy in circular and hosohedral-type Garside groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of Garside groups, which we call circular groups. We mainly prove that roots are unique up to conjugacy in circular groups. This allows us to completely classify these groups up to isomorphism. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of roots up to conjugacy in complex braid groups of rank 2.
  We also consider a generalization of circular groups, called hosohedral-type groups. These groups are defined using circular groups, and a procedure called the Delta-product, which we study in generality. We also study the uniqueness of roots up to conjugacy in hosohedral-type groups.</description>

Abstract: The isomorphism problem for infinite finitely presented groups is probably the hardest among standard algorithmic problems in group theory. Classes of groups where it has been completely solved are nilpotent groups, hyperbolic groups, and limit groups. In this short paper, we address the problem of isomorphism to particular groups, including free groups. We also address the algorithmic problem of embedding a finitely presented group in a given limit group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study boundedness of bundle diffeomorphism groups over a circle. For a fiber bundle $\pi : M \to S^1$ with fiber $N$ and structure group $\Gamma$ and $r \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0} \cup \{ \infty \}$ we distinguish an integer $k = k(\pi, r) \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}$ and construct a function $\widehat{\nu} : {\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0 \to {\Bbb R}_k$. When $k \geq 1$, it is shown that the bundle diffeomorphism group ${\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0$ is uniformly perfect and $clb_\pi\,{\rm Diff}^r_\pi(M)_0 \leq k+3$, if ${\rm Diff}_{\rho, c}(E)_0$ is perfect for the trivial fiber bundle $\rho : E \to {\Bbb R}$ with fiber $N$ and structure group $\Gamma$. On the other hand, when $k = 0$, it is shown that $\widehat{\nu}$ is a unbounded quasimorphism, so that ${\rm Diff}_\pi(M)_0$ is unbounded and not uniformly perfect. We also describe the integer $k$ in term of the attaching map $\phi$ for a mapping torus $\pi : M_\phi \to S^1$ and give some explicit examples of (un)bounded groups.</description>

      <title>The one-sided cycle shuffles in the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of shuffling operators on the symmetric group $S_n$, which includes the top-to-random shuffle. The general shuffling scheme consists of removing one card at a time from the deck (according to some probability distribution) and re-inserting it at a (uniformly) random position further below. Rewritten in terms of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$, our shuffle corresponds to right multiplication by a linear combination of the elements \[t_i:=\text{cyc}_{i}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,i+2}+\cdots+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,\ldots,n}\in \mathbb{R}[S_n]\] for all $i\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ (where $\text{cyc}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_p}$ stands for a $p$-cycle).
  We compute the eigenvalues of these shuffling operators and of all their linear combinations. In particular, we show that the eigenvalues of right multiplication by a linear combination $\lambda_1t_1+\lambda_2t_2+\cdots+\lambda_nt_n$ are the numbers $\lambda_1m_{I,1}+\lambda_2m_{I,2}+\cdots+\lambda_nm_{I,n}$, where $I$ ranges over the subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ that contain no two consecutive integers; here $m_{I,i}$ are certain integers. We compute the multiplicities of these eigenvalues and show that if they are all distinct, the shuffling operator is diagonalizable. To this purpose, we show that the operators of right multiplication by $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ on $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$ are simultaneously triangularizable (via a combinatorially defined basis). The results stated here over $\mathbb{R}$ for convenience are actually stated and proved over an arbitrary commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$.
  We finish by describing a strong stationary time for the random-to-below shuffle, which is the shuffle in which the card that moves below is selected uniformly at random, and we give the waiting time for this event to happen.</description>

      <title>Representations of braid groups via cyclic covers of the sphere: Zariski closure and arithmeticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$ be two natural numbers. Given any sequence $\kappa=(k_1,\dots,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\gcd(k_1,\dots,k_n,d)=1$, we consider the family of Riemann surfaces obtained from the plane curves defined by $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)^{k_i}$, where $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$ are $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. The monodromy of the cohomology of the fibers of this family provides us with a representation of the pure braid group $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into some symplectic group. By restricting to a specific subspace in the cohomology of the fibers, we obtain a representation $\rho_d$ of $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into a linear algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In a sense, $\rho_d$ is primitive with respect to the parameters $d$ and $\kappa$. The first main result of this paper is a criterion for the Zariski closure of the image of $\rho_d$ to be maximal, and the second main result is a criterion for the image to be an arithmetic lattice in the target group. The latter generalizes previous results of Venkataramana and gives an answer to a question by McMullen.</description>

      <title>Radical subgroups of finite reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radical subgroups play an important role in both group theory and representation theory. This is the first of a series of papers of ours in classifying radical $p$-subgroups of finite reductive groups and verifying the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for them, contributing to the program of proving the Alperin weight conjecture by verifying its inductive condition for simple groups. In this paper we present a uniform method of classifying radical subgroups of finite reductive groups. As an application, we complete the proof of the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for simple groups of type $F_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the twisted group C*-algebra of an acylindrically hyperbolic group -- not necessarily having trivial finite radical -- has stable rank one.</description>
