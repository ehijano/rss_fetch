      <title>On the uniformity and size of microsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a few questions regarding the uniformity and size of microsets of subsets of Euclidean space. First, we construct a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with Assouad dimension arbitrarily close to $d$ such that every microset of $K$ has no Ahlfors--David regular subset with dimension strictly larger than $0$. This answers a question of Orponen. Then, we show that for any non-empty compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with lower dimension $\beta$, there is a microset $E$ of $K$ with finite $\beta$-dimensional packing pre-measure. This answers a strong version of a question of Fraser--Howroyd--K\"aenm\"aki--Yu, who previously obtained a similar result concerning the upper box dimension.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and regularity for almost homogeneous spaces with Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a metric space $X$ is $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous if $G&lt;Iso(X)$ is a discrete group of isometries with $diam(X/G)&lt;\epsilon$.\ A sequence of $(\epsilon_i,G_i)$-homogeneous spaces $X_i$ with $\epsilon_i\to0$ is called a sequence of almost homogeneous spaces.
  In this paper we show that the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of almost homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces must be a nilpotent Lie group with $Ric\geqslant K$. We also obtain a topological rigidity theorem for $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces, which generalizes a recent result by Wang. Indeed, if $X$ is an $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ space and $G$ is an almost-crystallographic group, then $X/G$ is bi-H\"older to an infranil orbifold. Moreover, we study $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous spaces in the smooth setting and prove rigidity and $\epsilon$-regularity theorems for Riemannian orbifolds with Einstein metrics and bounded Ricci curvatures respectively.</description>

      <title>Compact harmonic RCD$(K, N)$ spaces are harmonic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focus on the properties and characterizations of harmonic RCD$(K,N)$ spaces, which are the counterparts of harmonic Riemannian manifolds in the non-smooth setting. We prove that a compact RCD$(K,N)$ space is isometric to a locally harmonic Riemannian manifold if it satisfies either of the following harmonicity conditions: (1) the heat kernel $\rho(x,y,t)$ depends only on the variable $t$ and the distance between points $x$ and $y$; (2) the volume of the intersection of two geodesic balls depends only on their radii and the distance between their centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the rectangular peg problem for a large class of continuous Jordan curves that contains all rectifiable curves and Stromquist's locally monotone curves. Our proof is based on microlocal sheaf theory and inspired by recent work of Greene and Lobb.</description>

      <title>Characterising trees and hyperbolic spaces by their boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the language of proper CAT(-1) spaces to study thick, locally compact trees, the real, complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the hyperbolic plane over the octonions. These are rank 1 Euclidean buildings, respectively rank 1 symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We give a uniform proof that these spaces may be reconstructed using the cross ratio on their visual boundary, bringing together the work of Tits and Bourdon.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff vs Gromov-Hausdorff distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold and let $X\subseteq M$. If the sample $X$ is sufficiently dense relative to the curvature of $M$, then the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $X$ and $M$ is bounded from below by half their Hausdorff distance, namely $d_{GH}(X,M) \ge \frac{1}{2} d_H(X,M)$. The constant $\frac{1}{2}$ can be improved depending on the dimension and curvature of the manifold $M$, and obtains the optimal value $1$ in the case of the unit circle, meaning that if $X\subseteq S^1$ satisfies $d_{GH}(X,S^1)&lt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}$, then $d_{GH}(X,S^1)=d_H(X,S^1)$. We also provide versions lower bounding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ between two subsets $X,Y\subseteq M$. Our proofs convert discontinuous functions between metric spaces into simplicial maps between \v{C}ech or Vietoris-Rips complexes. We then produce topological obstructions to the existence of certain maps using the nerve lemma and the fundamental class of the manifold, thus lower bounding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Plateau Bubbles and the Quintuple Bubble Theorem on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sullivan's multi-bubble isoperimetric conjectures in $n$-dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces assert that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was confirmed by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros (and later extended to $\mathbb{R}^n$). The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 2$) and the triple- and quadruple- bubble conjectures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ (for $n \geq 3$ and $n \geq 4$, respectively) were recently confirmed in our previous work, but the approach employed there does not seem to allow extending these results further.
  In this work, we confirm the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 5$), and as a consequence, by approximation, also the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 5$) but without the uniqueness assertion. Moreover, we resolve the conjectures on $\mathbb{S}^n$ and on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (without uniqueness) for all $q \leq n+1$, conditioned on the assumption that the singularities which appear at the meeting locus of several bubbles obey a higher-dimensional analogue of Plateau's laws. Another scenario we can deal with is when the bubbles are full-dimensional ("in general position"), or arrange in some good lower-dimensional configurations.
  To this end, we develop the spectral theory of the corresponding Jacobi operator (finding analogies with the quantum-graph formalism), and a new method for deforming the bubbles into a favorable configuration. As a by-product, we show that the Jacobi operator on a minimizing configuration always has index precisely $q-1$ and hence the corresponding isoperimetric profile is concave, answering a question of Heppes. Several compelling conjectures are proposed, which would allow extending our results to all $q \leq n+1$ unconditionally.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns SIC-POVMs and their relationship to class field theory. SIC-POVMs are generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) described by $d^2$ equiangular complex lines through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^d$. Weyl--Heisenberg SICs are those SIC-POVMs described by the orbit a single vector under a finite Weyl--Heisenberg group ${\rm WH}(d)$.
  We relate known data on the structure and classification of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in low dimensions to arithmetic data attached to certain orders of real quadratic fields. For $4 \le d \le 90$, we show the number of known geometric equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of the real quadratic order $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ of discriminant $\Delta=(d+1)(d-3)$; we conjecture the equality extends to all $d \ge 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies the existence of more than one geometric equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs for $d &gt; 22$. We conjecture Galois multiplets of SICs are in one-to-one correspondence with the over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ of $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ in such a way that the number of classes in the multiplet equals the ring class number of $\mathcal{O}'$. We test that conjecture against known data on exact SICs in low dimensions.
  We refine the class field hypothesis of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{(d+1)(d-3)})$ generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg SIC. The refined conjectures use a recently developed class field theory for orders of number fields (arXiv:2212.09177). The refined class fields assigned to over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ have a natural partial order under inclusion; the inclusions of these fields fail to be strict in some cases. We characterize such cases and give a table of them for $d &lt; 500$.</description>

      <title>On the Packing Functions of some Linear Sets of Lebesgue Measure Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a characterization of Minkowski measurability to study the asymptotics of best packing on cut-out subsets of the real line with Minkowski dimension $d\in(0,1)$. Our main result is a proof that Minkowski measurability is a sufficient condition for the existence of best packing asymptotics on monotone rearrangements of these sets. For each such set, the main result provides an explicit constant of proportionality $p_d,$ depending only on the Minkowski dimension $d,$ that relates its packing limit and Minkowski content. We later use the Digamma function to study the limiting value of $p_d$ as $d\to 1^-.$ For sharpness, we use renewal theory to prove that the packing constant of the $(1/2,1/3)$ Cantor set is less than the product of its Minkowski content and $p_d$. We also show that the measurability hypothesis of the main theorem is necessary by demonstrating that a monotone rearrangement of the complementary intervals of the 1/3 Cantor set has Minkowski dimension $d=\log2/\log3\in(0,1),$ is not Minkowski measurable, and does not have convergent first-order packing asymptotics. The aforementioned characterization of Minkowski measurability further motivates the asymptotic study of an infinite multiple subset sum problem.</description>
