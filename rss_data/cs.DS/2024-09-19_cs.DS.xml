      <title>Learning-Augmented Frequency Estimation in Sliding Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to utilize machine learning approaches to improve sliding window algorithms for approximate frequency estimation problems, under the ``algorithms with predictions'' framework. In this dynamic environment, previous learning-augmented algorithms are less effective, since properties in sliding window resolution can differ significantly from the properties of the entire stream. Our focus is on the benefits of predicting and filtering out items with large next arrival times -- that is, there is a large gap until their next appearance -- from the stream, which we show improves the memory-accuracy tradeoffs significantly. We provide theorems that provide insight into how and by how much our technique can improve the sliding window algorithm, as well as experimental results using real-world data sets. Our work demonstrates that predictors can be useful in the challenging sliding window setting.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of labeled matchings in triangular grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new reconfiguration problem of matchings in a triangular grid graph. In this problem, we are given a nearly perfect matching in which each matching edge is labeled, and aim to transform it to a target matching by sliding edges one by one. This problem is motivated to investigate the solvability of a sliding-block puzzle called ``Gourds'' on a hexagonal grid board, introduced by Hamersma et al. [ISAAC 2020]. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that, if a triangular grid graph is factor-critical and has a vertex of degree $6$, then any two matchings can be reconfigured to each other. Moreover, for a triangular grid graph (which may not have a degree-6 vertex), we present another sufficient condition using the local connectivity. Both of our results provide broad sufficient conditions for the solvability of the Gourds puzzle on a hexagonal grid board with holes, where Hamersma et al. left it as an open question.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the upgrading version of the maximal covering location problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the complexity of the upgrading version of the maximal covering location problem with edge length modifications on networks. This problem is NP-hard on general networks. However, in some particular cases, we prove that this problem is solvable in polynomial time. The cases of star and path networks combined with different assumptions for the model parameters are analysed. In particular, we obtain that the problem on star networks is solvable in O(nlogn) time for uniform weights and NP-hard for non-uniform weights. On paths, the single facility problem is solvable in O(n^3) time, while the p-facility problem is NP-hard even with uniform costs and upper bounds (maximal upgrading per edge), as well as, integer parameter values. Furthermore, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm is developed for the single facility problem on trees with integer parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.
  We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.
  Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).</description>

      <title>Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably, however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a $\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$ (following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$ space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal $\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to $\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and $\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$, in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an $\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$ (represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.</description>

      <title>Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently, few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures (Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic, and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming language.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Smooth Boosting and the Tightness of the Hardcore Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth boosters generate distributions that do not place too much weight on any given example. Originally introduced for their noise-tolerant properties, such boosters have also found applications in differential privacy, reproducibility, and quantum learning theory. We study and settle the sample complexity of smooth boosting: we exhibit a class that can be weak learned to $\gamma$-advantage over smooth distributions with $m$ samples, for which strong learning over the uniform distribution requires $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\gamma^2)\cdot m$ samples. This matches the overhead of existing smooth boosters and provides the first separation from the setting of distribution-independent boosting, for which the corresponding overhead is $O(1/\gamma)$.
  Our work also sheds new light on Impagliazzo's hardcore theorem from complexity theory, all known proofs of which can be cast in the framework of smooth boosting. For a function $f$ that is mildly hard against size-$s$ circuits, the hardcore theorem provides a set of inputs on which $f$ is extremely hard against size-$s'$ circuits. A downside of this important result is the loss in circuit size, i.e. that $s' \ll s$. Answering a question of Trevisan, we show that this size loss is necessary and in fact, the parameters achieved by known proofs are the best possible.</description>

      <title>A novel DFS/BFS approach towards link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have been shown to play a significant role in current knowledge mining fields, including life sciences, bioinformatics, computational social sciences, and social network analysis. The problem of link prediction bears many applications and has been extensively studied. However, most methods are restricted to dimension reduction, probabilistic model, or similarity-based approaches and are inherently biased. In this paper, we provide a definition of graph prediction for link prediction and outline related work to support our novel approach, which integrates centrality measures with classical machine learning methods. We examine our experimental results in detail and identify areas for potential further research. Our method shows promise, particularly when utilizing randomly selected nodes and degree centrality.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have been devoted to finding diverse solutions in classical combinatorial problems, such as Vertex Cover (Baste et al., IJCAI'20), Matching (Fomin et al., ISAAC'20) and Spanning Tree (Hanaka et al., AAAI'21). We initiate the algorithmic study of $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts which, given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \in V$, and an integer $k &gt; 0$, asks for a collection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We investigate the complexity of the problem for maximizing three diversity measures that can be applied to a collection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, (ii) the cardinality of the union of cuts in the collection, and (iii) the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We prove that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts can be solved in strongly polynomial time for diversity measures (i) and (ii) via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result by establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only collections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical algorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. For graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single max-flow computation. Our results stand in contrast to the problem of finding $k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the disjoint case (Hanaka et al., AAAI'23) -- and partially answer a long-standing open question of Wagner (Networks, 1990) about improving the complexity of finding disjoint collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. Lastly, we show that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts subject to diversity measure (iii) is NP-hard already for $k=3$.</description>

      <title>Approximation and FPT Algorithms for Finding DM-Irreducible Spanning Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a minimum-weight strongly connected spanning subgraph of an edge-weighted directed graph is equivalent to the weighted version of the well-known strong connectivity augmentation problem. This problem is NP-hard, and a simple $2$-approximation algorithm was proposed by Frederickson and J\'aj\'a (1981); surprisingly, it still achieves the best known approximation ratio in general. Also, Bang-Jensen and Yeo (2008) showed that the unweighted problem is FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) parameterized by the difference from a trivial upper bound of the optimal value. In this paper, we consider a generalization related to the Dulmage--Mendelsohn decompositions of bipartite graphs instead of the strong connectivity of directed graphs, and extend these approximation and FPT results to the generalized setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``sample amplification'' problem formalizes the following question: Given $n$ i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown distribution $P$, when is it possible to produce a larger set of $n+m$ samples which cannot be distinguished from $n+m$ i.i.d. samples drawn from $P$? In this work, we provide a firm statistical foundation for this problem by deriving generally applicable amplification procedures, lower bound techniques and connections to existing statistical notions. Our techniques apply to a large class of distributions including the exponential family, and establish a rigorous connection between sample amplification and distribution learning.</description>

      <title>The Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python (pip).</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. We propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Fixed-Parameter Tractability for Robot Inspection Planning</title>

Abstract: Autonomous robotic inspection, where a robot moves through its environment and inspects points of interest, has applications in industrial settings, structural health monitoring, and medicine. Planning the paths for a robot to safely and efficiently perform such an inspection is an extremely difficult algorithmic challenge. In this work we consider an abstraction of the inspection planning problem which we term Graph Inspection. We give two exact algorithms for this problem, using dynamic programming and integer linear programming. We analyze the performance of these methods, and present multiple approaches to achieve scalability. We demonstrate significant improvement both in path weight and inspection coverage over a state-of-the-art approach on two robotics tasks in simulation, a bridge inspection task by a UAV and a surgical inspection task using a medical robot.</description>
