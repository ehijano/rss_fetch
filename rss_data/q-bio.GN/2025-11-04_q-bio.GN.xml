      <title>AmpliconHunter2: a SIMD-Accelerated In-Silico PCR Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: We present AmpliconHunter2 (AHv2), a highly scalable in silico PCR engine written in C that can handle degenerate primers and uses a highly accurate melting temperature model. AHv2 implements a bit-mask IUPAC matcher with AVX2 SIMD acceleration, supports user-specified mismatches and 3' clamp constraints, calls amplicons in all four primer pair orientations (FR/RF/FF/RR), and optionally trims primers and extracts fixed-length flanking barcodes into FASTA headers. The pipeline packs FASTA into 2-bit batches, streams them in 16 MB chunks, writes amplicons to per-thread temp files and concatenates outputs, minimizing peak RSS during amplicon finding. We also summarize updates to the Python reference (AHv1.1).
  Availability and Implementation: AmpliconHunter2 is available as a freely available webserver at: https://ah2.uconn.engr.edu and source code is available at: https://github.com/rhowardstone/AmpliconHunter2 under an MIT license. AHv2 was implemented in C; AHv1.1 using Python 3 with Hyperscan.

      <title>SCUDDO: An unsupervised clustering algorithm for single-cell Hi-C maps using diagonal diffusion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Advances in high-throughput chromatin conformation capture have provided insight into the three- dimensional structure and organization of chromatin. While bulk Hi-C experiments capture spatio-temporally averaged chromatin interactions across millions of cells, single-cell Hi-C experiments report on the chromatin interactions of individual cells. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been developed to embed single-cell Hi-C maps and identify different cell types. However, single-cell Hi-C maps are often difficult to cluster due to their high sparsity, with state-of- the-art algorithms achieving a maximum Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of only &lt; 0.4 on several datasets while requiring labels for training.
  Results: We introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm, Single-cell Clustering Using Diagonal Diffusion Operators (SCUDDO), to embed and cluster single-cell Hi-C maps. We evaluate SCUDDO on three previously difficult-to-cluster single-cell Hi-C datasets, and show that it can outperform other current algorithms in ARI by &gt; 0.2. Further, SCUDDO outperforms all other tested algorithms even when we restrict the number of intrachromosomal maps for each cell type and when we use only a small fraction of contacts in each Hi-C map. Thus, SCUDDO can capture the underlying latent features of single-cell Hi-C maps and provide accurate labeling of cell types even when cell types are not known a priori.
  Availability: SCUDDO is freely available at www.github.com/lmaisuradze/scuddo. The tested datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus.</description>

      <title>Fast, memory-efficient genomic interval tokenizers for modern machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Epigenomic datasets from high-throughput sequencing experiments are commonly summarized as genomic intervals. As the volume of this data grows, so does interest in analyzing it through deep learning. However, the heterogeneity of genomic interval data, where each dataset defines its own regions, creates barriers for machine learning methods that require consistent, discrete vocabularies. Methods: We introduce gtars-tokenizers, a high-performance library that maps genomic intervals to a predefined universe or vocabulary of regions, analogous to text tokenization in natural language processing. Built in Rust with bindings for Python, R, CLI, and WebAssembly, gtars-tokenizers implements two overlap methods (BITS and AIList) and integrates seamlessly with modern ML frameworks through Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Results: The gtars-tokenizers package achieves top efficiency for large-scale datasets, while enabling genomic intervals to be processed using standard ML workflows in PyTorch and TensorFlow without ad hoc preprocessing. This token-based approach bridges genomics and machine learning, supporting scalable and standardized analysis of interval data across diverse computational environments.

      <title>Temperature reshapes epigenomic diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana - JSD and Methylator reveal RdDM-CMT2 plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA methylation can be associated with phenotypic plasticity, yet how temperature shapes DNA methylation diversity in natural populations is unclear. Analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 1075 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown at 10{\deg}C, 16{\deg}C, and 22{\deg}C, we quantified single-cytosine diversity using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD). Diversity consistently peaked at intermediate methylation levels across the CpG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts. Temperature modulated this diversity, primarily impacting intermediately methylated sites, with non-CG contexts (CHG and CHH) exhibiting increased diversity at warmer temperatures. Notably, at 22{\deg}C, CHH diversity patterns indicated altered balance between the RdDM and CMT2 pathways that regulate specific transposable element (TE) superfamilies. Furthermore, accessions from Southern Europe displayed higher non-CG diversity at 22{\deg}C compared to Northern European accessions. Our findings reveal that temperature influences the epigenomic diversity landscape, highlighting context-dependent plasticity, a dynamic interplay between silencing pathways, and potential geographic adaptation in response to environmental cues.</description>
