      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu.\,I.~Manin, M.~Sweedler and D.~Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J.~Patera and H.~Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal C$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal C$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>A global proof of the homological excess intersection formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel proof of the homological excess intersection formula for local complete intersections. The novelty is that the proof makes use of global morphisms comparing the intersections to a self intersection.</description>

      <title>Towards Compositional Interpretability for XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently based largely on black-box machine learning models which lack interpretability. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) strives to address this major concern, being critical in high-stakes areas such as the finance, legal and health sectors.
  We present an approach to defining AI models and their interpretability based on category theory. For this we employ the notion of a compositional model, which sees a model in terms of formal string diagrams which capture its abstract structure together with its concrete implementation. This comprehensive view incorporates deterministic, probabilistic and quantum models. We compare a wide range of AI models as compositional models, including linear and rule-based models, (recurrent) neural networks, transformers, VAEs, and causal and DisCoCirc models.
  Next we give a definition of interpretation of a model in terms of its compositional structure, demonstrating how to analyse the interpretability of a model, and using this to clarify common themes in XAI. We find that what makes the standard 'intrinsically interpretable' models so transparent is brought out most clearly diagrammatically. This leads us to the more general notion of compositionally-interpretable (CI) models, which additionally include, for instance, causal, conceptual space, and DisCoCirc models.
  We next demonstrate the explainability benefits of CI models. Firstly, their compositional structure may allow the computation of other quantities of interest, and may facilitate inference from the model to the modelled phenomenon by matching its structure. Secondly, they allow for diagrammatic explanations for their behaviour, based on influence constraints, diagram surgery and rewrite explanations. Finally, we discuss many future directions for the approach, raising the question of how to learn such meaningfully structured models in practice.</description>

      <title>Locally coherent exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A locally coherent exact category is a finitely accessible additive category endowed with an exact structure in which the admissible short exact sequences are the directed colimits of admissible short exact sequences of finitely presentable objects. We show that any exact structure on a small idempotent-complete additive category extends uniquely to a locally coherent exact structure on the category of ind-objects; in particular, any finitely accessible category has the unique maximal and the unique minimal locally coherent exact category structures. All locally coherent exact categories are of Grothendieck type in the sense of Stovicek. We also discuss the canonical embedding of a small exact category into the abelian category of additive sheaves in connection with the locally coherent exact structure on the ind-objects, and deduce two periodicity theorems as applications.</description>

      <title>Functors between representation categories. Universal modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ be two Lie algebras with $\mathfrak{h}$ finite dimensional and consider ${\mathcal A} = {\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h}, \, \mathfrak{g})$ to be the corresponding universal algebra as introduced in \cite{am20}. Given an ${\mathcal A}$-module $U$ and a Lie $\mathfrak{h}$-module $V$ we show that $U \otimes V$ can be naturally endowed with a Lie $\mathfrak{g}$-module structure. This gives rise to a functor between the category of Lie $\mathfrak{h}$-modules and the category of Lie $\mathfrak{g}$-modules and, respectively, to a functor between the category of ${\mathcal A}$-modules and the category of Lie $\mathfrak{g}$-modules. Under some finite dimensionality assumptions, we prove that the two functors admit left adjoints which leads to the construction of universal ${\mathcal A}$-modules and universal Lie $\mathfrak{h}$-modules as the representation theoretic counterparts of Manin-Tambara's universal coacting objects \cite{Manin, Tambara}.</description>
