      <title>Cohen-Lenstra flag universality for random matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n \times n$ random integer matrices $M_1,\ldots,M_k$, the cokernels of the partial products $\mathrm{cok}(M_1 \cdots M_i), 1 \leq i \leq k$ naturally define a random flag of abelian $p$-groups. We prove that as $n \to \infty$, this flag converges universally, for any nondegenerate entry distribution, to the Cohen-Lenstra type measure which weights each flag inversely proportional to the size of its automorphism group. As a corollary, we prove universality of certain formulas for the limiting conditional distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(M_1M_2)$ given $\mathrm{cok}(M_1),\mathrm{cok}(M_2)$ in terms of Hall-Littlewood structure constants, which were previously obtained only for Haar matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine the general technology of Sawin-Wood, matrix product moment computations following those of Nguyen-Van Peski, and the computation done previously for Haar $p$-adic matrices by Huang.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the canonical geodesic metric on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) in the regime $\kappa \in (4,8)$ where the loops intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary. Previous work of the authors and V. Ambrosio showed that the subsequential limits associated with certain approximation procedures for such a metric exist and are non-trivial. In this work, we show that the limit exists by proving that there is at most one geodesic metric on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket which satisfies certain properties. Further, we obtain that the limit is conformally covariant. This paper is the foundation of future work which show that the metric for $\kappa=6$ is the continuum scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for critical percolation in two dimensions. We further conjecture that for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the geodesic CLE$_\kappa$ metric is the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric associated with discrete models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>The Euler-Maruyama method for SDEs with low-regularity drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong $L^p$-convergence rates of the Euler-Maruyama method for stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion with low-regularity drift coefficients. Specifically, the drift is assumed to be in the Lebesgue-H\"{o}lder spaces $L^q([0,T]; {\mathcal C}_b^\alpha({\mathbb R}^d))$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $q\in (2/(1+\alpha),\infty]$. For every $p\geq 2$, by using stochastic sewing and/or the It\^{o}-Tanaka trick, we obtain the $L^p$-convergence rates: $(1+\alpha)/2$ for $q\in [2,\infty]$ and $(1-1/q)$ for $q\in (2/(1+\alpha),2)$. Moreover, we prove that the unique strong solution can be constructed via the Picard iteration.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework from Boltzmann Transport to Proton Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a rigorous mathematical formulation of proton transport by integrating both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. The deterministic framework is based on the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation, formulated as an operator equation in a suitable functional setting. The stochastic approach models proton evolution via a track-length parameterised diffusion process, whose infinitesimal generator provides an alternative description of transport.
  A key result is the duality between the stochastic and deterministic formulations, established through the adjoint relationship between the transport operator and the stochastic generator. We prove that the resolvent of the stochastic process corresponds to the Green's function of the deterministic equation, providing a natural link between fluence-based and particle-based transport descriptions. The theory is applied to dose computation, where we show that the classical relation: dose = (fluence * mass stopping power) arises consistently in both approaches.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a hybrid optimisation framework for treatment planning, in which dose is computed using a stochastic model while optimisation proceeds via adjoint-based PDE methods. We prove existence and differentiability of the objective functional and derive the first-order optimality system. This framework bridges stochastic simulation with deterministic control theory and provides a foundation for future work in constrained, adaptive and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Convergence and asymptotic freeness of missing data matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random matrix of the form $D_n \odot X_n$ (known as a variance profile matrix), where $\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product of the two matrices, $D_n$ is a deterministic matrix, and $X_n$ is a random matrix. We call $D_n\odot X_n$ as a missing data matrix of $X_n$ when the entries of $D_n$ are either $0$ or $1$. This framework is commonly used in various applied fields, such as biology, neuroscience, and network data analysis. We study the convergence and asymptotic freeness of missing data matrices of iid, elliptic, and covariance random matrices. Specifically, it is known that independent iid, elliptic, and covariance matrices converge to freely independent circular, elliptic, and Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur variables, respectively. In this article, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions on deterministic matrices $D_n$ for which these results hold true for independent missing data matrices of these three types of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Taxonomies of Cyber Incidents Into Detection Networks for Improved Detection Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many taxonomies exist to organize cybercrime incidents into ontological categories. We examine some of the taxonomies introduced in the literature; providing a framework, and analysis, of how best to leverage different taxonomy structures to optimize performance of detections targeting various types of threat-actor behaviors under the umbrella of precision and recall. Networks of detections are studied, and results are outlined showing properties of networks of interconnected detections. Some illustrations are provided to show how the construction of sets of detections to prevent broader types of attacks is limited by trade-offs in precision and recall under constraints. An equilibrium result is proven and validated on simulations, illustrating the existence of an optimal detection design strategy in this framework.</description>

      <title>Confluent hypergeometric kernel determinant on multiple large intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confluent hypergeometric point process represents a universality class which arises in a variety of different but related areas. It particularly describes the local statistics of eigenvalues in the bulk of spectrum near a Fisher-Hartwig singular point for a broad class of unitary ensembles. It is the aim of this work to investigate large gap asymptotics of this process over a union of disjoint intervals $\cup_{j=0}^{n}(sa_j,sb_j)$, where $a_0&lt;b_0&lt;\dots&lt;a_m&lt;0&lt;b_m&lt;\dots&lt;a_n&lt;b_n$ for some $0\leq m \leq n$. As $s\to +\infty$, we establish a general asymptotic formula up to and including the oscillatory term of order $1$, which involves a $\theta$-functions-combination integral along a linear flow on an $n$-dimensional torus. If the linear flow has ``good Diophantine properties'' or the ergodic properties, we further improve the error estimate or the leading term for the asymptotics of the integral. These results can be combined for the case $n=1$, which lead to a precise large gap asymptotics up to an undetermined constant.</description>

      <title>On Random Fields Associated with Analytic Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the broad application of the analytic wavelet transform (AWT), a systematic statistical characterization of its magnitude and phase as inhomogeneous random fields on the time-frequency domain when the input is a random process remains underexplored. In this work, we study the magnitude and phase of the AWT as random fields on the time-frequency domain when the observed signal is a deterministic function plus additive stationary Gaussian noise. We derive their marginal and joint distributions, establish concentration inequalities that depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analyze their covariance structures. Based on these results, we derive an upper bound on the probability of incorrectly identifying the time-scale ridge of the clean signal, explore the regularity of scalogram contours, and study the relationship between AWT magnitude and phase. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing rigorous AWT-based algorithms in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Bounds for Generalized First-Order Methods via Gaussian Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion. This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic Yang-Mills heat equation on the two-dimensional torus. Using regularity structures, Chandra, Chevyrev, Hairer, and Shen previously proved both the local well-posedness and gauge-covariance of this model. In this article, we revisit their results using para-controlled calculus. One of the main ingredients is a new coordinate-invariant perspective on vector-valued stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Classification of small-ball modes and maximum a posteriori estimators in metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16278v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mode, or `most likely point', for a probability measure $\mu$ can be defined in various ways via the asymptotic behaviour of the $\mu$-mass of balls as their radius tends to zero. Such points are of intrinsic interest in the local theory of measures on metric spaces and also arise naturally in the study of Bayesian inverse problems and diffusion processes. Building upon special cases already proposed in the literature, this paper develops a systematic framework for defining modes through small-ball probabilities. We propose `common-sense' axioms that such definitions should obey, including appropriate treatment of discrete and absolutely continuous measures, as well as symmetry and invariance properties. We show that there are exactly ten such definitions consistent with these axioms, and that they are partially but not totally ordered in strength, forming a complete, distributive lattice. We also show how this classification simplifies for well-behaved $\mu$.</description>

      <title>The Eyring-Kramers Law for the Extinction Time of the Contact Process on Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a precise estimate for the mean extinction time of the contact process with a fixed infection rate on a star graph with $N$ leaves. Specifically, we determine not only the exponential main factor but also the exact sub-exponential prefactor in the asymptotic expression for the mean extinction time as $N\to\infty$. Previously, such detailed asymptotic information on the mean extinction time of the contact process was available exclusively for complete graphs. To obtain our results, we first establish an accurate estimate for the stationary distribution of a modified contact process, employing special function theory and refined Laplace's method. Subsequently, we apply a recently developed potential theoretic approach for analyzing metastability in non-reversible Markov processes, enabling us to deduce the asymptotic expression. The integration of these methodologies constitutes a novel approach developed in this paper, one which has not been utilized previously in the study of the contact process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a version of first passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ where the random passage times on the edges are replaced by contact times represented by random closed sets on $\mathbb{R}$. Similarly to the contact process without recovery, an infection can spread into the system along increasing sequences of contact times. In case of stationary contact times, we can identify associated first passage percolation models, which in turn establish shape theorems also for first contact percolation. In case of periodic contact times that reflect some reoccurring daily pattern, we also present shape theorems with limiting shapes that are universal with respect to the within-one-day contact distribution. In this case, we also prove a Poisson approximation for increasing numbers of within-one-day contacts. Finally, we present a comparison of the limiting speeds of three models -- all calibrated to have one expected contact per day -- that suggests that less randomness is beneficial for the speed of the infection. The proofs rest on coupling and subergodicity arguments.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary (Fibonacci) words of 1's and 2's, graded by digit sum. Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549--568), we define clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ that generate random Fibonacci words of increasing length; unlike for the Young lattice (powered by the classical Schur functions), clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations -- parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. Second, we connect Fibonacci positivity with: (i) total positivity of tridiagonal matrices; (ii) Stieltjes moment sequences; (iii) the combinatorics of set partitions; and (iv) families of univariate orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme. We further link moment sequences of orthogonal polynomials to combinatorial structures on Fibonacci words, a connection that may be of independent interest. Third, we analyze scaling limits of the induced random words, obtaining stick-breaking-type limits (linked to GEM laws), new dependent stick-breaking limits, and limits supported on the discrete part of the Martin boundary of $\mathbb{YF}$. These results significantly extend the asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$ proved by Gnedin--Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), 433--446).
  Finally, we prove Cauchy-type identities for clone Schur functions with quadridiagonal-determinant right-hand side (in contrast to the product form for classical Schur functions), and construct models of random permutations and involutions from Fibonacci-positive specializations together with a Robinson--Schensted correspondence adapted to $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of two-dimensional determinantal processes associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new class of determinantal point processes in the complex plane coming from the ground state of free fermions associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators. These processes generalize the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory. We prove a two-term Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotic expansion for the Laplace transform of smooth linear statistics. This implies a law of large number and central limit theorem for the empirical field. The limiting variance includes both contributions from the bulk and boundary of the droplet. The boundary fluctuations depend on the Hamiltonian dynamics associated with the underlying operator and, generally, are not conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>Time multidimensional Markov Renewal chains -- An algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a new extension of the Markov Renewal theory is introduced by allowing time to evolve in multiple dimensions. The resulting chains are referred to as multi-time Markov Renewal chains and since this extension is new, the state space is assumed to be finite to cover the theoretical framework of applications, where the possible number of states of a physical system is finite. The flexibility of Markov renewal theory is still present in multiple time dimensions by allowing the sojourn times in the different states of the system to be arbitrarily selected from a multidimensional distribution. The convolution product of multidimensional matrix sequences plays a particular role in the development of the theory and some of its algebraic properties are given and explored, paying particular attention to the existence, the representation and the computation of the convolutional inverse. Some basic definitions and properties of this new class are given as well as the multi-time Markov renewal equations associated to the resulting processes. The practical implementation is achieved very efficiently through a novel adaptation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm for multidimensional matrix sequences.</description>

      <title>The Taylor Measure and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel collection of signed measures, which will be apply called Taylor measures. Stochastic versions of the new measures are also defined and studied. We illustrate, through examples, how the deterministic and stochastic versions of the proposed Taylor measures emerge as a unifying framework that includes many concepts from mathematics and probability theory as special cases.</description>

      <title>Nevai's condition for measures with unbounded supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Nevai's condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai's condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel-Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to $6\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>In spaces with a slow diffusion, the Riesz transform is unbounded on $L^p$, $p\in (2,\infty)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In graphs and Riemannian manifolds where the kernel of the diffusion semigroup satisfies pointwise sub-Gaussian estimates, we study the range of parameters \( p \in (1, \infty) \) and \( \gamma \in [0, 1] \) for which the quantities \( \|\Delta^\gamma f\|_p \) and \( \|\nabla f\|_p \) can be compared. In particular, we prove that in such metric spaces, the Riesz transform \( \nabla \Delta^{-1/2} \) is unbounded on \( L^p \) for all \( p \in (2, \infty) \), thereby demonstrating a clear departure from the behavior observed in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Random Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>M-estimation for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts from high-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a contrast-based estimation method for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts, observed under high-frequency sampling. The process is modeled as the sum of a deterministic drift function and a stationary Gaussian component with a parametric kernel. Our method constructs a local contrast function from adjacent increments, which avoids inversion of large covariance matrices and allows for efficient computation. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators under general ergodicity conditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the drift estimator attains a nonstandard convergence rate, stemming from the direct Riemann integrability of the drift density. This highlights a fundamental difference from standard estimation regimes. Furthermore, when the local contrast fails to identify all parameters in the covariance kernel, moment-based corrections can be incorporated to recover identifiability. The proposed framework is simple, flexible, and particularly well suited for high-frequency inference with time-inhomogeneous structure.</description>
