      <title>Bayesian Multi-line Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure (LSS) through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral-angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near infrared: H$\alpha$, $[$\ion{O}{3}$]$, H$\beta$, and $[$\ion{O}{2}$]$. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ level at $z&lt;2$. For the brightest line H$\alpha$, the $10\sigma$ sensitivity can be achieved out to $z\sim3$. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic shadows of causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic structure on the largest scales preserves the pattern laid down by quantum fluctuations of gravity in the early universe on scales comparable to inflationary horizons. It is proposed here that fluctuations create physical correlations only within finite regions enclosed by causal diamonds, like entanglement in other quantum systems. Conformal geometry is used to calculate a range of angular separation with no causal correlation. Correlations of the cosmic microwave background in this ``causal shadow'' are measured to be three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard inflation models. It is suggested that this measured symmetry of the primordial pattern signifies a new symmetry of quantum gravity associated with causal horizons.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-based model of galaxy power spectrum: Fast full-shape galaxy power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Neural Network based emulator for the galaxy redshift-space power spectrum that enables several orders of magnitude acceleration in the galaxy clustering parameter inference, while preserving 3$\sigma$ accuracy better than 0.5\% up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}$=0.25$h^{-1}Mpc$ within $\Lambda$CDM and around 0.5\% $w_0$-$w_a$CDM. Our surrogate model only emulates the galaxy bias-invariant terms of 1-loop perturbation theory predictions, these terms are then combined analytically with galaxy bias terms, counter-terms and stochastic terms in order to obtain the non-linear redshift space galaxy power spectrum. This allows us to avoid any galaxy bias prescription in the training of the emulator, which makes it more flexible. Moreover, we include the redshift $z \in [0,1.4]$ in the training which further avoids the need for re-training the emulator. We showcase the performance of the emulator in recovering the cosmological parameters of $\Lambda$CDM by analysing the suite of 25 AbacusSummit simulations that mimic the DESI Luminous Red Galaxies at $z=0.5$ and $z=0.8$, together as the Emission Line Galaxies at $z=0.8$. We obtain similar performance in all cases, demonstrating the reliability of the emulator for any galaxy sample at any redshift in $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.4$</description>

      <title>Echoes from a long time ago: Chewbacca inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of the early universe and beloved cultural icons.</description>

      <title>Circular reasoning: Solving the Hubble tension with a non-$\pi$ value of $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, cosmology has seen a surge in alternative models that purport to solve the discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ as measured by cosmological microwave background anisotropies and local supernovae, respectively. In particular, many of the most successful approaches have involved varying fundamental constants, such as an alternative value of the fine structure constant and time-varying values of the electron mass, the latter of which showed particular promise as the strongest candidate in several earlier studies. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we investigate a cosmological model where the value of the geometric constant $\pi$ is taken to be a free model parameter. Using the latest CMB data from Planck as well as baryon-acoustic oscillation data, we constrain the parameters of the model and find a strong correlation between $\pi$ and $H_0$, with the final constraint $H_0 = 71.3 \pm 1.1 \ \mathrm{ km/s/Mpc}$, equivalent to a mere $1.5\sigma$ discrepancy with the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration. Furthermore, our results show that $\pi = 3.206 \pm 0.038$ at $95 \%$ C.L., which is in good agreement with several external measurements discussed in the paper. Hence, we conclude that the $\pi \Lambda$CDM model presented in this paper, which has only a single extra parameter, currently stands as the perhaps strongest solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Exploring the baryonic effect signature in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 cosmic shear two-point correlations on small scales: the $S_8$ tension remains present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic feedback effect is considered as a possible solution to the so-called $S_8$ tension indicated in cosmic shear cosmology. The baryonic effect is more significant on smaller scales, and affects the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) with different scale- and redshift-dependencies from those of the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we use the Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 (HSC-Y3) data to measure the cosmic shear 2PCFs ($\xi_{\pm}$) down to 0.28 arcminutes, taking full advantage of the high number density of source galaxies in the deep HSC data, to explore a possible signature of the baryonic effect. While the published HSC analysis used the cosmic shear 2PCFs on angular scales, which are sensitive to the matter power spectrum at $k\lesssim 1~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, the smaller scale HSC cosmic shear signal allows us to probe the signature of matter power spectrum up to $k\simeq 20~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Using the accurate emulator of the nonlinear matter power spectrum, DarkEmulator2, we show that the dark matter-only model can provide an acceptable fit to the HSC-Y3 2PCFs down to the smallest scales. In other words, we do not find any clear signature of the baryonic effects or do not find a systematic shift in the $S_8$ value with the inclusion of the smaller-scale information as would be expected if the baryonic effect is significant. Alternatively, we use a flexible 6-parameter model of the baryonic effects, which can lead to both enhancement and suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to the dark matter-only model, to perform the parameter inference of the HSC-Y3 2PCFs. We find that the small-scale HSC data allow only a fractional suppression of up to 5 percent in the matter power spectrum at $k\sim 1~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which is not sufficient to reconcile the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Stupendously Large Black Hole Coalescence and Hubble Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant are in significant tension: local measurements of the Hubble constant appear to show a Universe that is significantly contracted when compared to distant measurements. From the point of view of an observer, a passing gravitational wave could cause the Universe to appear locally contracted and expanded in a quadrupolar pattern. The inspiral of a pair of stupendously large black holes (SLABs) with a chirp mass of $\sim10^{21}~\rm{M}_\odot$ may produce gravitational radiation with sufficiently large amplitude and wavelength to increase $H_0$ in one direction, and decrease it by the same amount in the other. These tensions would then oscillate with a period corresponding to half the orbital period of the binary. If such a gravitational wave were aligned with the plane of the Milky Way, most readily visible galaxies would appear closer than they actually are, thereby causing the apparent Hubble tension. Due to the long binary period, we would be in the same phase of the gravitational wave for the complete history of astronomical observation. The opposite tension would be visible in the orthogonal directions, thus giving the opportunity to falsify the existence of inspiraling SLAB binaries. As a corollary, the Hubble tension may place an upper limit on the maximum mass of inspiraling black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>FOOD I: A New Division Scheme For The Stelliferous Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the frontier of observational galaxy formation to push to ever higher redshift, deep within cosmic dawn. However, what is high-redshift, and when was cosmic dawn? While widely used, these terms (as well as many other confusing terms) are not consistently defined in the literature; this both hampers effective communication but also impedes our ability to precisely characterize and understand the phenomena under investigation. In this article we seek to address this issue of utmost importance. We begin by definitively defining terms such as ``high-redshift'', ``cosmic dawn'', etc. However, despite the rigorous definitions for them we present, both the adjective-based redshift and diurnal marker (time-of-day) division schemes suffer from issues including not being sufficiently granular, angering cosmologists, being arbitrary, and having a geocentric bias. To overcome these we introduce the \textit{redshiFt epOchs fOr everyboDy} (FOOD) framework, a revolutionary new division scheme based on eating occasions, i.e. meals.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and matter interacting scenario to relieve $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new cosmological model (called $\tilde\Lambda$CDM) in which the vacuum energy interacts with matter and radiation, and test this model using the current cosmological observations. Using the CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) dataset to constrain the model, we find that $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $2.87\sigma$ and $2.77\sigma$, respectively. However, in this case, the $\tilde\Lambda$CDM model is not favored by the data, compared with $\Lambda$CDM. We find that when the $H_0$ and $S_8$ data are added to the data combination, the situation is significantly improved. In the CBS+$H_0$ case, the model relieves the $H_0$ tension to $0.47\sigma$, and the model is favored over $\Lambda$CDM. In the CBS+$H_0$+$S_8$ case, we obtain a synthetically best situation, in which the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $0.72\sigma$ and $2.11\sigma$, respectively. In this case, the model is most favored by the data. Therefore, this cosmological model can greatly relieve the $H_0$ tension and simultaneously effectively alleviate the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid forces associated with primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generate small-scale fluctuations in the primordial density field, which add to the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ linear matter power spectrum on small scales. These enhanced small-scale fluctuations lead to earlier formation of galactic halos and stars and thus affect cosmic reionization. We study the consequences of these effects on 21 cm observables using the semi-numerical code 21cmFAST v3.1.3. We find the excess small-scale structure generates strong stellar radiation backgrounds in the early Universe, resulting in altered 21 cm global signals and power spectra commensurate with earlier reionization. We restrict the allowed PMF models using the CMB optical depth to reionization. Lastly, we probe parameter degeneracies and forecast experimental sensitivities with an information matrix analysis subject to the CMB optical depth bound. Our forecasts show that interferometers like HERA are sensitive to PMFs of order $\sim \mathrm{pG}$, nearly an order of magnitude stronger than existing and next-generation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial features, in particular oscillatory signals, imprinted in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations represent a clear window of opportunity for detecting new physics at high-energy scales. Future spectroscopic and photometric measurements from the $Euclid$ space mission will provide unique constraints on the primordial power spectrum, thanks to the redshift coverage and high-accuracy measurement of nonlinear scales, thus allowing us to investigate deviations from the standard power-law primordial power spectrum. We consider two models with primordial undamped oscillations superimposed on the matter power spectrum, one linearly spaced in $k$-space the other logarithmically spaced in $k$-space. We forecast uncertainties applying a Fisher matrix method to spectroscopic galaxy clustering, weak lensing, photometric galaxy clustering, cross correlation between photometric probes, spectroscopic galaxy clustering bispectrum, CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization, temperature-polarization cross correlation, and CMB weak lensing. We also study a nonlinear density reconstruction method to retrieve the oscillatory signals in the primordial power spectrum. We find the following percentage relative errors in the feature amplitude with $Euclid$ primary probes for the linear (logarithmic) feature model: 21% (22%) in the pessimistic settings and 18% (18%) in the optimistic settings at 68.3% confidence level (CL) using GC$_{\rm sp}$+WL+GC$_{\rm ph}$+XC. Combining all the sources of information explored expected from $Euclid$ in combination with future SO-like CMB experiment, we forecast ${\cal A}_{\rm lin} \simeq 0.010 \pm 0.001$ at 68.3% CL and ${\cal A}_{\rm log} \simeq 0.010 \pm 0.001$ for GC$_{\rm sp}$(PS rec + BS)+WL+GC$_{\rm ph}$+XC+SO-like both for the optimistic and pessimistic settings over the frequency range $(1,\,10^{2.1})$.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianities with weak lensing: Information on non-linear scales in the Ulagam full-sky simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are signatures in the density field that encode particle physics processes from the inflationary epoch. Such signatures have been extensively studied using the Cosmic Microwave Background, through constraining the amplitudes, $f^{X}_{\rm NL}$, with future improvements expected from large-scale structure surveys; specifically, the galaxy correlation functions. We show that weak lensing fields can be used to achieve competitive and complementary constraints. This is shown via the new Ulagam suite of N-body simulations, a subset of which evolves primordial fields with four types of PNGs. We create full-sky lensing maps and estimate the Fisher information from three summary statistics measured on the maps: the moments, the cumulative distribution function, and the 3-point correlation function. We find that the year 10 sample from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can constrain PNGs to $\sigma(f^{\rm\,eq}_{\rm NL}) \approx 110$, $\sigma(f^{\rm\,or,lss}_{\rm NL}) \approx 120$, $\sigma(f^{\rm\,loc}_{\rm NL}) \approx 40$. For the former two, this is better than or comparable to expected galaxy clustering-based constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The PNG information in lensing fields is on non-linear scales and at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1.25$), with a clear origin in the evolution history of massive halos. The constraining power degrades by $\sim\!\!60\%$ under scale cuts of $\gtrsim 20{\,\rm Mpc}$, showing there is still significant information on scales mostly insensitive to small-scale systematic effects (e.g. baryons). We publicly release the Ulagam suite to enable more survey-focused analyses.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) are driven by scale-free gravitational collapse, but they also reflect the rich astrophysical processes at play in galaxy clusters. At low masses ($\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) and high redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$), these properties remain poorly constrained observationally, due to the difficulty in obtaining resolved and sensitive data. This paper aims at investigating the inner structure of the ICM as seen through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in this regime of mass and redshift. Focus is set on the thermal pressure profile and the scaling relation between SZ flux and mass, namely the $Y_{\rm SZ} - M$ scaling relation. The three galaxy clusters XLSSC~072 ($z=1.002$), XLSSC~100 ($z=0.915$), and XLSSC~102 ($z=0.969$), with $M_{500} \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, were selected from the XXL X-ray survey and observed with the NIKA2 millimeter camera to image their SZ signal. XMM-Newton X-ray data were used in complement to the NIKA2 data to derive masses based on the $Y_X - M$ relation and the hydrostatic equilibrium. The SZ images of the three clusters, along with the X-ray and optical data, indicate dynamical activity related to merging events. The pressure profile is consistent with that expected for morphologically disturbed systems, with a relatively flat core and a shallow outer slope. Despite significant disturbances in the ICM, the three high-redshift low-mass clusters follow remarkably well the $Y_{\rm SZ}-M$ relation expected from standard evolution. These results indicate that the dominant physics that drives cluster evolution is already in place by $z \sim 1$, at least for systems with masses above $M_{500} \sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmography with Supernova Refsdal through time-delay cluster lensing: independent measurements of the Hubble constant and geometry of the Universe</title>

Abstract: We present new measurements of the values of the Hubble constant, matter density, dark energy density, and dark energy density equation-of-state parameters from a full strong lensing analysis of the observed positions of 89 multiple images and 4 measured time delays of SN Refsdal multiple images in the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223. By strictly following the identical modelling methodology as in our previous work, that was done before the time delays were available, our cosmographic measurements here are essentially blind based on the frozen procedure. Without using any priors from other cosmological experiments, in an open $w$CDM cosmological model, through our reference cluster mass model, we measure the following values: $H_0 = 65.1^{+3.5}_{-3.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm DE}=0.76^{+0.15}_{-0.10}$, and $w=-0.92^{+0.15}_{-0.21}$ (at the 68.3% confidence level). No other single cosmological probe is able to measure simultaneously all these parameters. Remarkably, our estimated values of the cosmological parameters, particularly $H_0$, are very robust and do not depend significantly on the assumed cosmological model and the cluster mass modelling details. The latter introduce systematic uncertainties on the values of $H_0$ and $w$ which are found largely subdominant compared to the statistical errors. The results of this study show that time delays in lens galaxy clusters, combined with extensive photometric and spectroscopic information, offers a novel and competitive cosmological tool.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravity with a new precision $E_G$ estimator using Planck + SDSS BOSS</title>

Abstract: The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating probe of gravity developed to test the prediction of general relativity (GR) for the relation between gravitational potential and clustering on the largest scales in the observable universe. We present a novel high-precision estimator for the $E_G$ statistic using CMB lensing and galaxy clustering correlations that carefully matches the effective redshifts across the different measurement components to minimize corrections. A suite of detailed tests is performed to characterize the estimator's accuracy, its sensitivity to assumptions and analysis choices and the non-Gaussianity of the estimator's uncertainty is characterized. After finalization of the estimator, it is applied to $\textit{Planck}$ CMB lensing and SDSS CMASS and LOWZ galaxy data. We report the first harmonic space measurement of $E_G$ using the LOWZ sample and CMB lensing and also updated constraints using the final CMASS sample and the latest $\textit{Planck}$ CMB lensing map. We find $E_G^{Planck+CMASS} = 0.36^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ (68.27%) and $E_G^{\rm \textit{Planck}+LOWZ} = 0.40^{+0.11}_{-0.09} $ (68.27%), with additional subdominant systematic error budget estimates of 2% and 3% respectively. Using $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ constraints from $\textit{Planck}$ and SDSS BAO observations, $\Lambda$CDM-GR predicts $E_G^{\rm GR} (z = 0.555) = 0.401 \pm 0.005$ and $E_G^{\rm GR} (z = 0.316) = 0.452 \pm 0.005$ at the effective redshifts of the CMASS and LOWZ based measurements. We report the measurement to be in good statistical agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM-GR prediction, and report that the measurement is also consistent with the more general GR prediction of scale-independence for $E_G$. This work provides a carefully constructed and calibrated statistic with which $E_G$ measurements can be confidently and accurately obtained with upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Tomographic redshift dipole: Testing the cosmological principle</title>

Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, implying all matter shares the same rest frame. This principle suggests that velocity estimates of our motion from various sources should agree with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole's inferred velocity of 370 km/s. Yet, for over two decades, analyses of radio galaxy and quasar catalogs have found velocities at odds with the CMB dipole, with tensions up to 5$\sigma$. In a blind analysis of BOSS and eBOSS spectroscopic data from galaxies and quasars across $0.2&lt;z&lt;2.2$, we applied a novel dipole estimator for a tomographic approach, robustly correcting biases and quantifying uncertainties with realistic mock catalogs. Our findings, indicating a velocity of $353^{+123}_{-111}$ km/s, show a $1.4\sigma$ agreement with the CMB dipole and a 2-to-3$\sigma$ tension with previous number count studies. These results support the cosmological principle, emphasizing our motion's consistency with the CMB across vast cosmic distances. Addressing the disparities with earlier number count analyses will be essential for further validating the cosmological principle.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A modern highly-parallel gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics solver for astrophysical and cosmological applications</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations have become one of the key tools used by theorists in all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code SWIFT. The software package exploits hybrid shared- and distributed-memory task-based parallelism, asynchronous communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. SWIFT also evolves neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code architecture, summarise the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed, and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run with SWIFT.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Dragons: A Two-Component Mixture Model of COSMOS Galaxies</title>

Abstract: Using the photometric population prediction method {\bf Red Dragon}, we characterize the Red Sequence (RS) and Blue Cloud (BC) of DES galaxies in the COSMOS field. Red Dragon (RD) uses a redshift-evolving, error-corrected Gaussian mixture model to detail the distribution of photometric colors, smoothly parameterizing the two populations with relative weights, mean colors, intrinsic scatters, and inter-color correlations. This resulting fit of RS and BC yields RS membership probabilities $P_{\rm RS}$ for each galaxy. Even when training on only DES main bands $griz$, RD selects the quiescent population (defined here as galaxies with $\lg {\rm sSFR \cdot yr} &lt; -11$) with $\gtrsim 90\%$ balanced accuracy out to $z=2$; augmenting with extended photometry from VIRCAM improves this accuracy to $\sim 95\%$ out to $z=3$. We measure redshift evolution of sSFR and galactic age in several stellar mass bins, finding that the BC is consistently more star-forming (by $\gtrsim 1~{\rm dex}$) and typically younger (by $\gtrsim 1~{\rm Gyr}$) than the RS (up to $z \sim 1.4$). This characterization of both RS and BC as functions of redshift and stellar mass improves our understanding of both populations and opens the door to more precise galaxy population characterization in future deep optical and IR systems.</description>

      <title>X-ray-inferred kinematics of the core ICM in Perseus-like clusters: Insights from the TNG-Cluster simulation</title>

Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we examine the gas thermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on the total mass and inner ICM properties, such as their cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at $z=0$. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles, and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes $&lt; 10\%$ to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with high-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these outflows in observations may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They also increase both the inferred and intrinsic ICM velocity dispersion. This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy lines.</description>
