      <title>A generative model for Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs: selection functions for binary stars, giant planets, and compact object companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources with He star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point-like objects observed with extremely high X-ray luminosity that exceeds the Eddington limit of a $\rm10\,M_\odot$ black hole. A fraction of ULXs has been confirmed to contain neutron star (NS) accretors due to the discovery of their X-ray pulsations. The donors detected in NS ULXs are usually luminous massive stars because of the observational biases. Recently, the He donor star in NGC 247 ULX-1 has been identified, which is the first evidence of a He donor star in ULXs. In this paper, we employed the stellar evolution code MESA to investigate the formation of ULXs through the NS+He star channel, in which a He star transfers its He-rich material onto the surface of a NS via Roche-lobe overflow. We evolved a large number of NS+He star systems and provided the parameter space for the production of ULXs. We found that the initial NS+He star systems should have $\rm\sim 0.7-2.6 \, M_\odot$ He star and $\rm \sim 0.1-2500\, d$ orbital period for producing ULXs, eventually evolving into intermediate-mass binary pulsars. According to binary population synthesis calculations, we estimated that the Galactic rate of NS ULXs with He donor stars is in the range of $\sim1.6-4.0\times10^{-4}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and that there exist $\sim7-20$ detectable NS ULXs with He donor stars in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Sunspot Areas Derived by Automated Sunspot-Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspot-area measurements using digital images captured by two telescopes at the Mitaka campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan are conducted using automated sunspot detection. A comparison between sunspot areas derived from Mitaka and those from the reference data by Mandal et al. ({\it Astron. Astrophys.} {\bf 640,} A78, 2020), who compiled a cross-calibrated daily sunspot-area catalog, revealed that the correlation coefficients between them are high (0.96--0.97), whereas the areas in the Mitaka data are 70 \%--83 \% of those of Mandal et al. The correlation is limited by the differences in observation times and detection capabilities of spots near the limb, with discrepancies in areas arising from different definitions of spot outlines. Given the high correlation and the ease of calibrating area discrepancies with a correction factor, automated sunspot detection appears promising for future sunspot-area measurements. Furthermore, we addressed the measurements of brightness deficit caused by sunspots.</description>

      <title>Spatial distributions of EUV brightenings in the quiet-Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of large numbers of localised transient EUV brightenings, with small spatial scales, in the quiet-Sun corona has been one of the key early results from Solar Orbiter. However, much is still unknown about these events. Here, we aim to better understand EUV brightenings by investigating their spatial distributions, specifically whether they occur co-spatial with specific line-of-sight magnetic field topologies in the photospheric network. EUV brightenings are detected using an automated algorithm applied to a high-cadence (3 s) dataset sampled over ~30 min on 8 March 2022 by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager's 17.4 nm EUV High Resolution Imager. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly are used to provide context about the line-of-sight magnetic field and for alignment purposes. We found a total of 5064 EUV brightenings within this dataset that are directly comparable to events reported previously in the literature. These events occurred within around 0.015-0.020 % of pixels for any given frame. We compared eight different thresholds to split the EUV brightenings into four different categories related to the line-of-sight magnetic field. Using our preferred threshold, we found that 627 EUV brightenings (12.4 %) occurred co-spatial with Strong Bipolar configurations and 967 EUV brightenings (19.1 %) occurred in Weak Field regions. Fewer than 10 % of EUV brightenings occurred co-spatial with Unipolar line-of-sight magnetic field no matter what threshold was used. Of the 627 Strong Bipolar EUV Brightenings, 54 were found to occur co-spatial with cancellation whilst 57 occurred co-spatial with emergence. EUV brightenings preferentially occur co-spatial with the strong line-of-sight magnetic field in the photospheric network. They do not, though, predominantly occur co-spatial with (cancelling) bi-poles.</description>

      <title>Heavy element abundances from a universal primordial distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a freeze-out approach to the formation of heavy elements in expanding nuclear matter. Applying concepts used in the description of heavy-ion collisions or ternary fission, we determine the abundances of heavy elements taking into account in-medium effects such as Pauli blocking and the Mott effect, which describes the dissolution of nuclei at high densities of nuclear matter. With this approach, we search for a universal primordial distribution in an equilibrium state from which the gross structure of the solar abundances of heavy elements freezes out via radioactive decay of the excited states. The universal primordial state is characterized by the Lagrangian parameters of temperature and chemical potentials of neutrons and protons. We show that such a state exists and determine a temperature of 5.266 MeV, a neutron chemical potential of 940.317 MeV and a proton chemical potential of 845.069 MeV, at a baryon number density of 0.013 fm$^{-3}$ and a proton fraction of 0.13. Heavy neutron-rich nuclei such as the hypothesized double-magic nucleus $^{358}$Sn appear in the primordial distribution and contribute to the observed abundances after fission. We discuss astrophysical scenarios for the realization of this universal primordial distribution for heavy element nucleosynthesis, including supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and the inhomogeneous Big Bang. The latter scenario may be of interest in the light of early massive objects observed with the James Webb Space Telescope and opens new perspectives to explain universality of the observed r-process patterns and the lack of observations of population III stars.</description>

      <title>Stellar surface information from the Ca II H&amp;K lines -- II. Defining better activity proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our former paper I, we showed on the Sun that different active regions possess unique intensity profiles on the Ca II H &amp; K lines. We now extend the analysis by showing how those properties can be used on real stellar observations, delivering more powerful activity proxies for radial velocity correction. More information can be extracted on rotational timescale from the Ca II H &amp; K lines than the classical indicators: S-index and log(R'HK). For high-resolution HARPS observations of alpha Cen B, we apply a principal and independent component analysis on the Ca II H &amp; K spectra time-series to disentangle the different sources that contribute to the disk-integrated line profiles. While the first component can be understood as a denoised version of the Mount-Wilson S-index, the second component appears as powerful activity proxies to correct the RVs induced by the inhibition of the convective blueshift in stellar active regions. However, we failed to interpret the extracted component into a physical framework. We conclude that a more complex kernel or bandpass than the classical triangular of the Mount Wilson convention should be used to extract activity proxies. To this regard, we provide the first principal component activity profile obtained across the spectral type sequence between M1V to F9V type stars.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 2000$ days.</description>

      <title>On the Instrumental Discrepancies in Lyman-alpha Observations of Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the energetic significance of Lyman-alpha (Ly{\alpha}; 1216\AA) emission from solar flares, regular observations of flare related Ly{\alpha} have been relatively scarce until recently. Advances in instrumental capabilities and a shift in focus over previous Solar Cycles mean it is now routinely possible to take regular co-observations of Ly{\alpha} emission in solar flares. Thus, it is valuable to examine how the instruments selected for flare observations may influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis of their unique measurements. Here, we examine three M-class flares each observed in Ly{\alpha} by GOES-14/EUVS-E, GOES-15/EUVS-E, or GOES-16/EXIS-EUVS-B, and at least one other instrument from PROBA2/LYRA, MAVEN/EUVM, ASO-S/LST-SDI, and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P. For each flare, the relative and excess flux, contrast, total energy, and timings of the Ly{\alpha} emission were compared between instruments. It was found that while the discrepancies in measurements of the relative flux between instruments may be considered minimal, the calculated contrasts, excess fluxes, and energetics may differ significantly - in some cases up to a factor of five. This may have a notable impact on multi instrument investigations of the variable Ly{\alpha} emission in solar flares and estimates of the contribution of Ly{\alpha} to the radiated energy budget of the chromosphere. The findings presented in this study will act as a guide for the interpretation of observations of flare-related Ly{\alpha} from upcoming instruments during future Solar Cycles and inform conclusions drawn from multi-instrument studies.</description>

      <title>Cross-Field Diffusion Effects on Particle Transport in a Solar Coronal Flux Rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key agents of space weather phenomena, posing severe threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) indicate that the magnetic flux ropes of a CME can trap energetic particles and act as barriers, preventing other particles from crossing. In this paper, we introduce the novel COCONUT+PARADISE model to investigate the confinement of energetic particles within a flux rope and the effects of cross-field diffusion (CFD) on particle transport in the solar corona, particularly in the presence of a CME. Using the global magnetohydrodynamic coronal model COCONUT, we generate background configurations containing a CME modeled as a Titov-D\'emoulin flux rope (TDFR). We then utilize the particle transport code PARADISE to inject monoenergetic 100 keV protons inside one of the TDFR legs near its footpoint and evolve the particles through the COCONUT backgrounds. To study CFD, we employ two different approaches regarding the perpendicular proton mean free path (MFP): a constant MFP and a Larmor radius-dependent MFP. We contrast these results with those obtained without CFD. While particles remain fully trapped within the TDFR without CFD, we find that even relatively small perpendicular MFP values allow particles on the outer layers to escape. In contrast, the initially interior trapped particles stay largely confined. Finally, we highlight how our model and this paper's results are relevant for future research on particle acceleration and transport in an extended domain encompassing both the corona and inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Effects of background solar wind and drag force on the propagation of coronal mass ejection driven shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagation of interplanetary (IP) shocks, particularly those driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is still an outstanding question in heliophysics and space weather forecasting. Here we address effects of the ambient solar wind on the propagation of two similar CME-driven shocks from the Sun to Earth. The two shock events (CME03: April 3, 2010 and CME12: July 12, 2012) have the following properties: Both events (1) were driven by a halo CME (i.e., source location is near the Sun-Earth line), (2) had a CME source in the southern hemisphere, (3) had a similar transit time (~2 days) to Earth, (4) occurred in a non-quiet solar period, and (5) led to a severe geomagnetic storm. The initial (near the Sun) propagation speed, as measured by coronagraph images, was slower (by ~300 km/s) for CME03 than CME12, but it took about the same amount of traveling time for both events to reach Earth. According to the in-situ solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft, the CME03-driven shock was associated with a faster solar wind upstream of the shock than the CME12-driven shock. This is also demonstrated in our global MHD simulations. Analysis of our simulation result indicates that the drag force indirectly plays an important role in the shock propagation. The present study suggests that in addition to the initial CME propagation speed near the Sun the shock speed (in the inertial frame) and the ambient solar wind condition, in particular the solar wind speed, are the key to timing the arrival of CME-driven-shock events.</description>

      <title>Full interferometric map of the L1157 southern outflow: Formamide (NH$_2$CHO) can form in the gas, after all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation mechanism of interstellar formamide (NH$_2$CHO), a key prebiotic precursor, is currently a matter of hot debate within the astrochemistry community, with both gas-phase and grain-surface chemical pathways having been proposed as its dominant formation route. The aim of the present study is to place firm observational constraints on the formation pathways leading to formamide thanks to new interferometric observations of the molecular outflow driven by the protostellar binary L1157. We employed the IRAM NOEMA interferometer to map the entire southern outflow of L1157, which contains three main shocked regions with increasing post-shock age: B0, B1, and B2. This allowed us to measure how the abundance of formamide, that of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and the ratio of the two, vary with time in this region. In order to gain a greater understanding of the most likely formation routes of formamide, we ran a grid of astrochemical models and compared these to our observations. A comparison between observations and astrochemical modelling indicates that there are two possible scenarios: one in which the amount of formamide observed can be explained by gas-phase-only chemistry, and more specifically via the reaction H$_2$CO + NH$_2$ $\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO + H$_2$, and another in which part of the observed formamide originates from surface chemistry and part from gas-phase chemistry. Surface chemistry alone cannot account for the abundance of formamide that we measure. While grain-surface chemistry cannot be ruled out, the present study brings definitive proof that gas-phase chemistry does work in L1157-B and acts efficiently in the production of this molecular species.</description>

Abstract: The double neutron star PSR J1846-0513 is discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey. The pulsar is revealed to be harbored in an eccentric orbit with $e=0.208$ and orbital period of 0.613 days. The total mass of the system is constrained to be $2.6287(35)\rm{M}_{\odot}$, with a mass upper limit of $1.3455{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the pulsar and a mass lower limit of $1.2845{\rm~M}_{\odot}$ for the companion star. To reproduce its evolution history, we perform a 1D model for the formation of PSR J1846-0513 whose progenitor is assumed to be neutron star - helium (He) star system via MESA code. Since the large eccentricity is widely believed to originate from an asymmetric supernova explosion, we also investigate the dynamical effects of the supernova explosion. Our simulated results show that the progenitor of PSR J1846-0513 could be a binary system consisting of a He star of $3.3-4.0{\rm~M}_\odot$ and a neutron star in a circular orbit with an initial period of $\sim0.5$ days.</description>

      <title>The Flattest Infrared Extinction Curve in Four Isolated Dense Molecular Cloud Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extinction curve of interstellar dust in the dense molecular cloud cores is crucial for understanding dust properties, particularly size distribution and composition. We investigate the infrared extinction law in four nearby isolated molecular cloud cores, L429, L483, L673, and L1165, across the 1.2 - 8.0 $\mu$m wavelength range, using deep near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data from UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\sim$ 40-60 mag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios $E(K-\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\lambda)$ versus $(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat infrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most pronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is consistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain growth in dense environments. Intriguingly, our findings align closely with the Astrodust model for a diffuse interstellar environment proposed by Hensley \&amp; Draine. This agreement between dense core observations and a diffuse medium model highlights the complexity of dust evolution and the need for further investigation into the processes governing dust properties in different interstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Implementation of thermal conduction energy transfer models in the Bifrost Solar atmosphere MHD code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal EUV Wavefronts: the Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding CMEs, and Connection with the CME-driven Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefront speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>

Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band follow-up I. Carbon-chain chemistry of intermediate-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>
