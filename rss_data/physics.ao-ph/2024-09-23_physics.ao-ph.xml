      <title>Evolution of the Archean Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Archean atmospheric evolution is the transition from an abiological atmosphere, to an atmosphere for which the composition and therefore climate is highly altered by life. We review the key processes and transitions in this evolution.</description>

      <title>Prithvi WxC: Foundation Model for Weather and Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triggered by the realization that AI emulators can rival the performance of traditional numerical weather prediction models running on HPC systems, there is now an increasing number of large AI models that address use cases such as forecasting, downscaling, or nowcasting. While the parallel developments in the AI literature focus on foundation models -- models that can be effectively tuned to address multiple, different use cases -- the developments on the weather and climate side largely focus on single-use cases with particular emphasis on mid-range forecasting. We close this gap by introducing Prithvi WxC, a 2.3 billion parameter foundation model developed using 160 variables from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Prithvi WxC employs an encoder-decoder-based architecture, incorporating concepts from various recent transformer models to effectively capture both regional and global dependencies in the input data. The model has been designed to accommodate large token counts to model weather phenomena in different topologies at fine resolutions. Furthermore, it is trained with a mixed objective that combines the paradigms of masked reconstruction with forecasting. We test the model on a set of challenging downstream tasks namely: Autoregressive rollout forecasting, Downscaling, Gravity wave flux parameterization, and Extreme events estimation. The pretrained model with 2.3 billion parameters, along with the associated fine-tuning workflows, has been publicly released as an open-source contribution via Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Interpretable multiscale Machine Learning-Based Parameterizations of Convection for ICON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03251v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based parameterizations have been developed for Earth System Models (ESMs) with the goal to better represent subgrid-scale processes or to accelerate computations. ML-based parameterizations within hybrid ESMs have successfully learned subgrid-scale processes from short high-resolution simulations. However, most studies used a particular ML method to parameterize the subgrid tendencies or fluxes originating from the compound effect of various small-scale processes (e.g., radiation, convection, gravity waves) in mostly idealized settings or from superparameterizations. Here, we use a filtering technique to explicitly separate convection from these processes in simulations with the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) in a realistic setting and benchmark various ML algorithms against each other offline. We discover that an unablated U-Net, while showing the best offline performance, learns reverse causal relations between convective precipitation and subgrid fluxes. While we were able to connect the learned relations of the U-Net to physical processes this was not possible for the non-deep learning-based Gradient Boosted Trees. The ML algorithms are then coupled online to the host ICON model. Our best online performing model, an ablated U-Net excluding precipitating tracer species, indicates higher agreement for simulated precipitation extremes and mean with the high-resolution simulation compared to the traditional scheme. However, a smoothing bias is introduced both in water vapor path and mean precipitation. Online, the ablated U-Net significantly improves stability compared to the non-ablated U-Net and runs stable for the full simulation period of 180 days. Our results hint to the potential to significantly reduce systematic errors with hybrid ESMs.</description>
