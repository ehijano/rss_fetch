      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.</description>
