      <title>Deep learning for the semi-classical limit of the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we integrate neural networks and Gaussian wave packets to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a smooth potential near the semi-classical limit. Our focus is not only on accurately obtaining solutions when the non-dimensional Planck's constant, $\varepsilon$, is small, but also on constructing an operator that maps initial values to solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation with multiscale properties. Using Gaussian wave packets framework, we first reformulate the Schr\"odinger equation as a system of ordinary differential equations. For a single initial condition, we solve the resulting system using PINNs or MscaleDNNs. Numerical simulations indicate that MscaleDNNs outperform PINNs, improving accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude. When dealing with a set of initial conditions, we adopt an operator-learning approach, such as physics-informed DeepONets. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of physics-informed DeepONets with Gaussian wave packets in accurately mapping initial conditions to solutions.</description>

      <title>An S-matrix Formalism for the Nonclassical Optical Response of Plasmonic Sphere Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational method for the scattering of light by multiple nonclassical plasmonic nanospheres, each of which has multiple (non-)concentric dielectric or metallic layers, is presented. The electromagnetic (EM) response of the free electrons in the metals is described by three popular mesoscopic models: the nonlocal hydrodynamic Drude model (NLHDM) and its diffusive variant, namely the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) model, as well as the surface response model (SRM). The main equation behind the method is set up by detailing the evaluation of the S-matrix for each individual spherical interface and the interactions amongst the interfaces. The algorithm is numerically validated by comparing with an in-house boundary element method (BEM) solver for a spherical NP with two smaller embedded spheres, and physically checked on a trimer configuration, where the responses from the NLHDM and SRM are contrasted with the local response model (LRM). In both cases a very good agreement is seen regarding frequency shifts and field enhancements.</description>

      <title>Hot-Ham: an accurate and efficient E(3)-equivariant machine-learning electronic structures calculation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinations of machine learning with ab initio methods have attracted much attention for their potential to resolve the accuracy-efficiency dilemma and facilitate calculations for large-scale systems. Recently, equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that explicitly incorporate symmetry constraints have demonstrated promise for interatomic potential and density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian predictions. However, the high-order tensors used to represent node and edge information are coupled through the Clebsch-Gordan tensor product (CGTP), leading to steep increases in computational complexity and seriously hindering the performance of equivariant MPNNs. Here, we develop High-order Tensor machine-learning Hamiltonian (Hot-Ham), an E(3) equivariant MPNN framework that combines two advanced technologies local coordinate transformation and Gaunt tensor product (GTP) to efficiently model DFT Hamiltonians. These two innovations significantly reduce the complexity of tensor products from O(L^6) to O(L^3) or O(L^2 log^2 L) for the max tensor order L, and enhance the performance of MPNNs. Benchmarks on several public datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy with relatively few parameters, and the applications to multilayer twisted moir\'e systems, heterostructures and allotropes showcase its generalization ability and high efficiency. Our Hot-Ham method provides a new perspective for developing efficient equivariant neural networks and would be a promising approach for investigating the electronic properties of large-scale materials systems.</description>

      <title>A second-order volumetric boundary treatment for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new volumetric-type boundary treatment is introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method. Populations are projected onto a discontinuous piecewise linear basis and streamed using an exact geometrical mapping. The method is implemented in 2D for convex, stationary geometries. Stability is verified through a novel analysis tool based on the eigenvalues of the streaming operation. A convergence rate of $\geq2$ is achieved, indicating improved accuracy over precursor methods. For flow around a 2D airfoil, the method yields better lift and drag predictions.</description>

      <title>Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.</description>

      <title>Glassy interphases reinforce elastomeric nanocomposites by enhancing percolation-driven volume expansion under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nearly a century, introduction of nanoparticles to elastomers has yielded extraordinarily tough nanocomposites that are critical to technologies from actuators to tires. The mechanisms by which this reinforcement occurs have nevertheless remained a central open question in material science. One widely debated hypothesis posits that strong interactions between polymer and particles induce "glassy bridges" that cement particles into a cohesive percolating network that resists elongation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide elongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein competition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume to increase on deformation. This induces contributions from the elastomer's bulk modulus, which is of order 1000 times larger than its Young's modulus. These findings establish a unified understanding of low-strain reinforcement in filled elastomers as emanating from volumetric competition between coexisting particulate and elastomeric networks. This reframes and unifies our understanding of low-strain reinforcement, provides a clear-cut diagnostic for the presence of glassy bridging, and offers a new design principle for tough elastomeric nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>LEMURS dataset: Large-scale multi-detector ElectroMagnetic Universal Representation of Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LEMURS: an extensive dataset of simulated calorimeter showers designed to support the development and benchmarking of fast simulation methods in high-energy physics, most notably providing a step towards the development of foundation models. This new dataset is more robust than the well-established CaloChallenge dataset 2, featuring substantially greater statistics, a wider range of incident angles in the detector, and most crucially multiple detector geometries (including more realistic calorimeters). The dataset is provided in HDF5 format, with a file structure inspired by the CaloChallenge shower representation while also including more variables. LEMURS scale and diversity make it particularly suitable for development of foundation models and has been used in the CaloDiT-2 model, a pre-trained model released in the community standard simulation toolkit Geant4 (version 11.4.beta). All data and code for generation and analysis are openly accessible, facilitating reproducibility and reuse across the community.</description>

      <title>Gas Sensing Properties of Novel Indium Oxide Monolayer: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the gas sensing capabilities of a novel two-dimensional Indium Oxide (In2O3) monolayer, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Targeting both resistive-type and work function based detection mechanisms, we evaluate interactions with ten hazardous gases (NH3, NO, NO2, SO2, CS2, H2S, HCN, CCl2O, CH2O, CO) as well as ambient molecules (O2, CO2, H2O). The monolayer shows pronounced sensitivity towards NO and H2S, and work function modulation enables detection of NH3 and HCN. Mechanical strain further broadens detection capability, enhancing adsorption and selectivity. These results establish 2D In2O3 as a tunable platform for next-generation miniaturized gas sensors for environmental monitoring and safety applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving Tangling in Multi-Conformer Refinement via Iterative Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics. Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement. This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture protein dynamics at atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Vanadium-Engineered Co2NiSe4 Nanomaterial: Coupled Thermoelectric, Piezoelectric, and Electronic Optimization via DFT+U for Advanced Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To realize the creation of advanced multifunctional materials in energy storage and conversion technologies, the present research evaluates the structural, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, mechanical, thermoelectric, piezoelectric and optical properties of pristine and vanadium-doped Co2NiSe4 by first-principles density functional theory (DFT + U ). It addresses the use of vanadium substitution to tailor the material, its performance and the inclusion of diverse fields by changing its electronic structure and its bonding properties. It can be seen in the results that V doping improves electrical conductivity and magnetic ordering because of a higher density of states and a stronger spin polarization at the Fermi level. Thermodynamic calculations show enhanced entropy stabilization at high temperatures and, mechanical analysis suggests an enhanced elastic moduli that proves the enhanced structural integrity without affecting ductility. The thermoelectric properties have been greatly improved realize an optimal ZT of ~1.1 at 900 K with 5 at.% V doping owing to an ideal combination of Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and inhibited thermal conductivity. Also, optical analysis reveals that expanded absorption spectra, increased dielectric response, adjustable reflectivity and energy loss spectra, optical properties can be used in photonic, and other optoelectronic devices. Better piezoelectric coefficients due to its effectiveness when doped also appeal to the usefulness of its application in nanoscale electromechanical systems. The combination of these results makes V-doped Co2NiSe4, a versatile material platform of next-generation energy storage, thermoelectric generation, and novel multifunctional sensors.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Stability and Spectral Shifts: A DFT+U Study of Eu-Doped ZnWO$_4$ for Visible-Light Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tungstate-based oxides have attracted significant attention owing to their excellent structural stability, chemical robustness, and versatile optical properties, making them suitable for next-generation optoelectronic and phosphor applications. Among these, ZnWO$_4$ has emerged as a promising host matrix; however, the role of europium (Eu) substitution in modulating its optoelectronic behavior remains underexplored. In this work, we employ spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) within the GGA+U framework to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of pristine ZnWO$_4$ and Eu-doped ZnWO4 systems. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms dynamical stability for both pristine and doped structures. Eu doping reduces the bandgap, introduces new localized states near the Fermi level, and significantly alters the density of states, thereby enhancing electronic transitions. The optical response reveals a broadened dielectric function, red-shifted absorption edge, and intensified extinction coefficient, consistent with the presence of Eu 4f states. Additionally, reflectivity and energy-loss spectra indicate improved photon-phonon coupling and optical tunability upon doping. These findings highlight that Eu incorporation not only stabilizes the ZnWO$_4$ lattice but also tailors its optoelectronic features, positioning Eu-doped ZnWO4 as a potential candidate for white-light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs) and related optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient subspace harmonic relaxation algorithm for coarse-graining of molecular systems with nearly exact thermodynamic consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, J. Chem. Phys. 162, 214101 (2025), a novel approach for the rigidification of a molecular cluster was proposed, in which starting with an all-atom (AA) potential, a coarse-grained (CG) potential for the associated cluster of rigid monomers was constructed directly. The method is based on using the harmonic approximation for the fast intramolecular degrees of freedom. While conceptually primitive, the resulting CG model turned out to be surprisingly accurate for selected water and ammonia clusters. However, as originally formulated, a single evaluation of the CG potential turned out to be much more expensive than the evaluation of the AA potential, since the former required a subspace minimization followed by a subspace normal mode calculation. In this communication, we formulate the approach more broadly, making it applicable, e.g., to coarse-graining a large protein. We also introduce key algorithmic improvements, reducing the cost of the subspace minimization and normal mode calculation. Combined with the fact that the CG simulation requires roughly an order of magnitude fewer Monte Carlo steps to reach similar statistical accuracy for selected observables compared to the AA model, the overall computational cost becomes comparable. These improvements are demonstrated on a water cluster.</description>

      <title>Modeling Reactions on the Solid-Liquid Interface With Next Generation Extended Lagrangian Quantum-Based Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for atomistic simulations of surface catalysis under electrochemical bias. The framework makes use of extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer quantum-based molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) simulations, which provide the speed and accuracy required for explicit atomistic treatment of both electrode and electrolyte. Simulations of solvated O$_2$ near nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) were performed to gain insight into the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Different mechanisms were observed, depending on the applied bias. Under high bias ORR occurred by an outer sphere mechanism, without adsorption of O$_2$ to NG. In this mechanism, electron transfer between the catalyst and the O$_2$ was mediated by the solvent. Under low bias ORR occurred by an inner sphere mechanism involving adsorption of O$_2$ to NG, leading to direct electron transfer. Combining quantum accuracy with explicit solvation and bias, XL-BOMD opens a route to predictive, atomistic insight into electrocatalytic processes beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple, efficient and parameter-free filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Our results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize IQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard systems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to exact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and correlation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE, we use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement the IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced three-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real hardware noise. While ibm_fez runs closely match exact results, discrepancies highlight the gap between modeled and physical noise. This study demonstrates both the IQPE's potential and current limitations for simulating strongly correlated systems under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspiration, Classical Advantage: Dequantized particle algorithm for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>
