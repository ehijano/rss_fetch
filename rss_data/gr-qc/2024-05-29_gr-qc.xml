      <title>The deceleration parameter in perturbed Bianchi universes with a "tilt"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative motion effects have long been known to ``contaminate'' the observations. In fact, when looking back to the history of astronomy, one finds a number of examples where relative motions have led to a gross misinterpretation of reality. Using relativistic cosmological perturbation theory it was shown that observers living inside bulk-flow domains that expand slightly slower than their surroundings, can have the illusion of cosmic acceleration, while the host universe is actually decelerating. This claim was originally based on studies of a perturbed tilted Einstein-de Sitter model, primarily for mathematical simplicity. Nevertheless, nothing really changed when the background universe was replaced by a Friedmann cosmology with nonzero pressure and spatial curvature. This raised the possibility that the peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter, as measured locally by the bulk-flow observers, may be generic and independent of the specifics of the host universe. Here, we investigate this possibility, by extending the earlier studies to perturbed Bianchi cosmologies. We find that the picture remains unchanged, unless the Bianchi background has unrealistically high anisotropy. The peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter, as measured by the relatively moving observers, is essentially the same with that reported earlier in a perturbed Einstein-de Sitter universe and in the rest of its Friedmann counterparts.</description>

      <title>Rapid detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes mergers using sparse dictionary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines for compact binary coalescence based on matched-filtering have reported over 90 confident detections during the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network. Decreasing the latency of detection, in particular for future detectors anticipated to have high detection rates, remains an ongoing effort. In this paper, we develop and test a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm for the rapid detection of GWs. We evaluate the algorithms biases and estimate its GW detection rate for an astrophysical population of binary black holes. The SDL algorithm is assessed using both, simulated data injected into the proposed A+ detector sensitivity and real data containing confident detections from the third LVK observing run. We find that our SDL algorithm can reconstruct a single binary black hole signal in less than 1 s. This suggests that SDL could be regarded as a promising approach for rapid, efficient GW detection in future observing runs of ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing cosmography using third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed exposition of a statistical method for estimating cosmological parameters from the observation of a large number of strongly lensed binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers observable by third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This method, first presented in $\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.261401}{[1]}$, compares the observed number of strongly lensed GW events and their time delay distribution (between lensed images) with observed events to infer cosmological parameters. We show that the precision of the estimation of the cosmological parameters does not have a strong dependance on the assumed BBH redshift distribution model. An incorrect model for the distribution of lens properties and redshifts can lead to a biased cosmological inference. However, Bayesian model selection can assist in selecting the right model from a set of available parametric models for the distribution of lens redshift and properties. We also present a way to incorporate the effect of contamination in the data due to the limited efficiency of lensing identification methods, so that it will not bias the cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>The impact of gravitational waveform model systematics on the measurement of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron stars with theoretical model predictions reveals important information about the sources, such as the masses and the distance to the stars. The latter can be used to determine the Hubble Constant, the rate at which the Universe expands. One general problem of all astrophysical measurements is that theoretical models only approximate the real underlying physics, which can lead to systematic uncertainties introducing biases. However, the extent of this bias for the distance measurement due to uncertainties of gravitational waveform models is unknown. In this study, we analyze a synthetic population of 38 binary neutron star sources measured with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo at design sensitivity. We employ a set of four different waveform models and estimate model-dependent systematic biases on the extraction of the Hubble Constant using the bright siren method. Our results indicate that systematic biases are below statistical uncertainties for the current generation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gravitational wave memory in the radiative process of entangled quantum probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine entangled quantum probes in geodesic trajectories in a background with gravitational wave (GW) burst. In particular, these quantum probes are prepared initially either in the symmetric or anti-symmetric Bell's states and we study the radiative process as the GW burst passes. Our considered GW burst backgrounds have the profiles of -- Heaviside-theta, $tanh$, Gaussian, and $sech$-squared functions respectively. The first two burst profiles have an asymmetric nature and thus result in non-zero gravitational wave memory. Whereas, for the last two symmetric profiles there is no asymptotic memory. For eternal switching, our observations suggest that the collective transition rate for the entangled probes due to symmetric GW bursts remains the same as obtained in the flat space. Whereas, for asymmetric bursts with memory, there is a finite change, indicating a direct possibility to distinguish between the two above-mentioned scenarios. We also consider finite switching in terms of Gaussian functions and observe characteristic differences in the radiative process between the GW backgrounds with and without memory. Notably, if the Gaussian switching is peaked much later compared to the passing of GW, only memory profiles contribute to the radiative process. We further discuss the physical implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effect of absorption on the ringdown of a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown gravitational wave signal arising e.g., in the final stage of a black hole binary merger, contains important information about the properties of the remnant, and can potentially be used to perform clean tests of general relativity. However, interpreting the ringdown signal, in particular when it is the loudest, requires understanding the role of nonlinearities and their potential impact on modelling this phase using quasinormal modes. Here, we focus on a particular nonlinear effect arising from the change in the black hole's mass and spin due to the partial absorption of a quasinormal perturbation. We isolate and systematically study this third-order, secular effect by evolving the equations governing linear metric perturbations on the background of a spinning black hole, but allowing the properties of the background to evolve in a prescribed way. We find that this leads to the excitation of quasinormal modes with higher polar angular number, retrograde modes (counter-rotating with respect to the black hole), and overtones, as well as giving rise to a component of the signal at early times that cannot be fully described using quasinormal modes. Quantifying these effects, we find that they may be relevant in analyzing the ringdown in black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Curvature fluctuations in a baby quantum gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the microscopic behavior of spacetime is critical for developing a theory of quantum gravity and perhaps solving the cosmological constant problem. In this context, it has been proposed that the quantity of interest is the quantum uncertainty in the Ricci scalar and here we investigate this for a discrete baby quantum gravity model based a single square cell. We find that the averaged Ricci scalar vanishes to leading order but has UV-divergent fluctuations. While this behavior is stable under renormalization, it appears not to be under the introduction of a small cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We investigate in detail the attractor behavior of some inflationary models based on braneworld dynamics under the constant-roll condition. We describe the dynamics of the models, assuming that the second slow-roll parameter remains constant during inflation. We show that the dynamics of the considered models have the property of a cosmological attractor.</description>

      <title>Effects of external field and potential on non-relativistic quantum particles in disclinations background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-relativistic quantum particles immersed in a cosmic string space-time background. Our study involves the examination of these particles as they interact with a range of influences, including potential, magnetic, and quantum flux fields. We employ analytical methods to solve the associated wave equation, leading to the derivation of eigenvalue solutions for this quantum system. Subsequently, we leverage these eigenvalue solutions to scrutinize several potential models. For each model, we present and engage in a thorough discussion of the corresponding eigenvalue solutions. In an extension of our investigation, we explore the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the quantum system when it is exposed to non-zero temperature conditions, denoted by $T \neq 0$. Our analysis encompasses the calculation of essential parameters such as the partition function for the system and other pertinent functions. Following these calculations, we meticulously examine and interpret the outcomes, shedding light on the system's behavior and characteristics in the presence of temperature variations. Furthermore, we calculate entropic information to investigate the location of particles in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new tool for studying strongly coupled matter: an effective theory of black holes in gravity, which maps to a hydrodynamic description of field theories via the gauge-gravity duality. Our approach is inspired by previously known effective theories found in the limit of high number of dimensions. We argue that the new approach can accurately describe phase transitions in a wide class of theories, such as the Yang-Mills and other nearly critical field theories. As an application, we analyze the interface between confining and deconfining phases in holographic Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study local structure of the moduli space of compact Einstein metrics with respect to the boundary conformal metric and mean curvature. In dimension three, we confirm M. Anderson's conjecture in a strong sense, showing that the map from Einstein metrics to such boundary data is generically a local diffeomorphism. In dimensions greater than three, we obtain similar results for Ricci flat metrics and negative Einstein metrics under new non-degenerate boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral shift symmetries of the massless free bosons in two dimensions are global symmetries that are somewhat similar to asymptotic symmetries. They are most transparent in double-null coordinates where they are parametrized by two functions of one variable. In BMS-type coordinates, half of them appear as an infinite tower of sub-leading super-shift symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses several functional analytic issues relevant for field theories in the context of the Hamiltonian formulation for a free, massless, scalar field defined on a closed interval of the real line. The fields that we use belong to a Sobolev space with a scalar product. As we show this choice is useful because it leads to an explicit representation of the points in the fibers of the phase space (the cotangent bundle of the configuration space). The dynamical role of the boundary of the spatial manifold where the fields are defined is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar superfluid is considered and interpreted in terms of electromagnetism and gravity. It has previously been suggested that the superfluid flow can be regarded as analogous to an electromagnetic field and that a non-vanishing density gradient give rise to a gravity-like force. The present work seeks to reconcile these hitherto distinct pictures into a unified exposition of vortex electrodynamics in a curved analogue space-time. By constructing a theory in which the planar Maxwell's equations are coupled to a (d+1)-dimensional conformally curved space-time, we expose a correspondence between the resulting equations of motion of the embedded fields and the dynamics of a quantum fluid. Finally, an effective vortex metric whose connection components are torsional is studied and its effect on the superfluid Maxwell's equations is elucidated upon.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

Abstract: The long-term evolution of astrophysical systems is driven by a Hamiltonian that is independent of the fast angle. As this Hamiltonian may contain explicitly time-dependent parameters, the conservation of mechanical energy is not guaranteed in such systems. We derive how the semi-major axis evolves in these cases. We analyze two astrophysically interesting examples, those of the harmonic and quadrupole perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a cosmological model of scale-dependent gravity. The gravitational action is taken to be the Einstein-Hilbert term supplemented with a cosmological constant, where the couplings, $G_k$ and $\Lambda_k$, run with the energy scale $k$. %
Also, notice that, by construction, our formalism recovers general relativity when in the limit of constant Newton's coupling. %
Two sub-models based on the scale-dependent cosmological model are confronted with recent observational data from:
  i) the Hubble parameter $H(z)$,
  ii) distance modulus $\mu(z)$, and iii) baryon acoustic scale evolution as functions of redshift (BAO). %
The viability of the model is discussed, obtaining the best-fit parameters and the maximum likelihood contours for these observables. Finally, a joint analysis is performed for $H(z)$+$\mu(z)$+BAO.</description>

      <title>Non-triviality of asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired metrics in pure $R^2$ gravity</title>

Abstract: In Phys. Rev. D $\textbf{107}$, 104008 (2023) we reported a novel exact closed-form solution which describes asymptotically flat spacetimes in pure $R^2$ gravity. The solution is Ricci scalar flat, viz. $R\equiv0$ everywhere. Whereas any metric with a null Ricci scalar would $\textit{trivially}$ satisfy the $R^2$ vacuo field equation, $R\left(R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{4}g_{\mu\nu}\,R\right)+g_{\mu\nu}\,\square\,R-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}R=0$, in this article, we shall show that our solution satisfies a "stronger" version of the $R^2$ vacuo field equation, viz. $R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{4}g_{\mu\nu}\,R+R^{-1}\left(g_{\mu\nu}\,\square\,R-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}R\right)=0$, despite the term $R^{-1}$ being $\textit{singular}$. Even though $R$ identically vanishes, for our solution, the combinations $\,R^{-1}\,\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}R\,$ and $\,R^{-1}\,\square\,R\,$ are $\textit{free of singularity}$. This exceptional property sets our solution apart from the set of null-Ricci-scalar metrics and makes it a genuinely $\textit{non-trivial}$ solution. We further demonstrate that, as a member of a larger class of asymptotically de Sitter metrics, our solution is resilient against perturbations in the scalar curvature at largest distances, making it relevant for physical situations where the background deviates from asymptotic flatness.</description>

Abstract: The Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole metric represents a spherically symmetric deformation of the Schwarzschild solution due to quantum-gravity corrections. Assuming the absence of nonspherical deformations of the metric, this problem was solved nonperturbatively. In this study, we investigate the intensity of Hawking radiation in the background of such quantum-corrected black holes and the behavior of their quasinormal modes (QNM). Our findings indicate that while the geometry and such classical characteristics as the fundamental QNM frequencies or the shadow radius are only slightly altered, the Hawking radiation and the frequencies of QNM overtones of sufficiently small black holes change much more significantly. This Hawking radiation enhancement arises due to much larger grey-body factors, while the Hawking temperature remains unaffected. The effect becomes significant at the latest stage of black hole evaporation.</description>

Abstract: In the standard derivation of the Kerr-Schild double copy, the geodicity of the Kerr-Schild vector and the stationarity of the spacetime are presented as assumptions that are necessary for the single copy to satisfy Maxwell's equations. However, it is well known that the vacuum Einstein equations imply that the Kerr-Schild vector is geodesic and shear-free, and that the spacetime possesses a distinguished vector field that is simultaneously a Killing vector of the full spacetime and the flat background, but need not be timelike with respect to the background metric. We show that the gauge field obtained by contracting this distinguished Killing vector with the Kerr-Schild graviton solves the vacuum Maxwell equations, and that this definition of the Kerr-Schild double copy implies the Weyl double copy when the spacetime is Petrov type D. When the Killing vector is taken to be timelike with respect to the background metric, we recover the familiar Kerr-Schild double copy, but the prescription is well defined for any vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime and we present new examples where the Killing vector is null or spacelike. While most examples of physical interest are type D, vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes are generically of Petrov type II. We present a straightforward example of such a spacetime and study its double copy structure. Our results apply to real Lorentzian spacetimes as well as complex spacetimes and real spacetimes with Kleinian signature, and provide a simple correspondence between real and self-dual vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetimes. This correspondence allows us to study the double copy structure of a self-dual analog of the Kerr spacetime. We provide evidence that this spacetime may be diffeomorphic to the self-dual Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Suppression of matter density growth at scales exceeding the cosmic screening length</title>

Abstract: One of the main objectives of modern cosmology is to explain the origin and evolution of cosmic structures at different scales. The principal force responsible for the formation of such structures is gravity. In a general relativistic framework, we have shown that matter density contrasts do not grow over time at scales exceeding the cosmic screening length, which corresponds to a cosmological scale of the order of two to three gigaparsecs at the present time, at which gravitational interactions exhibit an exponential cut-off. This is a purely relativistic effect. To demonstrate the suppression of density growth, we have performed N-body simulations in a box with a comoving size of $5.632\,{\rm Gpc}/h$ and obtained the power spectrum of the mass density contrast. We have shown that it becomes independent of time for scales beyond the cosmic screening length as a clear manifestation of the cosmic screening effect.</description>

      <title>The effect of wave dark matter on equal mass black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For dark matter to be detectable with gravitational waves from binary black holes, it must reach higher than average densities in their vicinity. In the case of light (wave-like) dark matter, the density of dark matter between the binary can be significantly enhanced by accretion from the surrounding environment. Here we show that the resulting dephasing effect on the last ten orbits of an equal mass binary is maximized when the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the orbital separation, $2\pi/\mu\sim d$. The phenomenology of the effect is different from the channels that are usually discussed, where dynamical friction (along the orbital path) and radiation of energy and angular momentum drive the dephasing, and is rather dominated by the radial force (the spacetime curvature in the radial direction) towards the overdensity between the black holes. Whilst our numerical studies limit us to scales of the same order, this effect may persist at larger separations and/or particle masses, playing a significant role in the merger history of binaries.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of the torsion field is analyzed in the framework of the Covariant Canonical Gauge Theory of Gravity (CCGG), a De~Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of gauge gravity. The action is quadratic in both, the torsion and the Riemann-Cartan tensor. Since the latter adds the derivative of torsion to the equations of motion, torsion is no longer identical to spin density, as in the Einstein-Cartan theory, but an additional propagating degree of freedom. As torsion turns out to be totally anti-symmetric, it can be parametrised via a single axial vector. It is shown in this paper that, in the weak torsion limit, the axial vector obeys a wave equation with an effective mass term which is partially dependent on the scalar curvature. The source of torsion is thereby given by the fermion axial current which is the net fermionic spin density of the system. Possible measurable effects and approaches to experimental analysis are addressed. For example, neutron star mergers could act as a dipoles or quadrupoles for torsional radiation, and an analysis of radiation of pulsars could lead to a detection of torsion wave background radiation.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity in four spacetime dimensions have vanishing induced linear tidal response. We extend this result beyond linear order for the polar sector, by solving the static nonlinear Einstein equations for the perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric and computing the quadratic corrections to the electric-type tidal Love numbers. After explicitly performing the matching with the point-particle effective theory at leading order in the derivative expansion, we show that the Love number couplings remain zero at higher order in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: In this article we analyze an effective action derived from a 7-dimensional $BF$ theory that, upon dimensional reduction, it transforms into an effective 4-dimensional action. Such resulting effective action involves a generic metric; however, we study a cosmological model described by a de Sitter universe, with a Hubble constant $H_{0}=67.70 \,\rm [km\, s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}]$. We compute the barotropic parameter $\omega \equiv p/\rho$ to analyze our solutions. Three different upshots are presented, where this model can transit from quintessence to the phantom regimes, crossing the theoretical phantom divide line. Thus the effective $BF$ action represents a quintom scenario.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; however, it has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A timelike membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon that is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the membrane paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the black-hole charges of M87* and Sagittarius A* by changing rates of photon spheres can be relaxed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration observed ring images called the shadows of M87* and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which are supermassive objects in M87 and our galaxy, respectively, and their general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes imply that the observed rings are formed by the gravitational lensing of synchrotron radiations from a hot plasma near outside of supermassive black holes. EHT collaboration gave constrains on the electrical or alternative charges of M87* and Sgr A* under an assumption that the radius of the observed ring should be proportional to the changing rates of photon spheres by the charges. Since the validness of this assumption is not sure, it is worth to checking the same constraints under another assumption. On this paper, we consider the changing rates of not only the photon spheres but also lensing rings in a simple model and we test whether aforementioned constrain is robust. We conclude that EHT collaboration's constraints based on the changing rates of the photon spheres can be relaxed compared to that based on the changing rate of the lensing rings while we do not claim that the observed rings are formed by the photon spheres and the lensing rings in our simple model. We concentrate on Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole spacetimes in this paper, but our result implies the relaxation of the bound of the charge parameters on other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>

      <title>Evolution and final fate of massive post-common-envelope binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are nowadays observed routinely thanks to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. In the isolated binary-evolution channel, a common-envelope (CE) phase of a red supergiant (RSG) and a compact object is crucial to sufficiently shrink the orbit and thereby enable a merger via GW emission. Here, we use the outcomes of two three-dimensional (3D) magneto-hydrodynamic CE simulations of an initially 10.0 solar-mass RSG with a 5.0 solar-mass BH and a 1.4 solar-mass NS, respectively, to explore the further evolution and final fate of the post-CE binaries. Notably, the 3D simulations reveal that the post-CE binaries are likely surrounded by circumbinary disks (CBDs), which contain substantial mass and angular momentum to influence the subsequent evolution. The binary systems in MESA modelling undergo another phase of mass transfer (MT) and we find that most donor stars do not explode in ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe), but rather in Type Ib/c SNe. The final orbits of our models with the BH companion are too wide, and NS kicks are actually required to sufficiently perturb the orbit and thus facilitate a merger via GW emission. Moreover, by exploring the influence of CBDs, we find that mass accretion from the disk widens the binary orbit, while CBD-binary resonant interactions can shrink the separation and increase the eccentricity depending on the disk mass and lifetime. Efficient resonant contractions may even enable a BH or NS to merge with the remnant He stars before a second SN explosion, which may be observed as gamma-ray burst-like transients, luminous fast blue optical transients and Thorne-\.Zytkow objects. For the surviving post-CE binaries, the CBD-binary interactions may significantly increase the GW-induced double compact merger fraction. We conclude that accounting for CBD may be crucial to better understand observed GW mergers.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the impact of cosmic curvature on structure formation through general relativistic first-order perturbation theory. We analyze continuity and Euler equations, incorporating cosmic curvature into Einstein equations. Emphasizing late-time dynamics, we investigate matter density contrast evolution in the presence of cosmic curvature, with a specific focus on sub-hubble scales. Solving the evolution equation, we conduct data analysis using cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernova observations and $f\sigma_8$ data. While constraints on some parameters remain consistent, excluding cosmic curvature tightens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 80}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models. Intriguingly, the non-phantom behavior of dark energy proves more favorable in both $w$CDM and CPL models across diverse data combinations.</description>

      <title>Effects on neutrino propagation in space-time foam of D-branes revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from the cosmos have proven to be ideal for probing the nature of space-time. Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned. An extended analysis of the revised IceCube data will further test these observations and stringy quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.</description>
