      <title>Design of a specimen to train path-dependent deep learning material models from a single uniaxial test: eliciting strain diversity via automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks accurately learn nonlinear, path-dependent material behavior. However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling.</description>

      <title>UGKS and UGKWP Methods for Multiscale Simulation of Electrostatic Plasma in Quasineutral and Hydrodynamic Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme (UGKS) and the Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method for electrostatic plasma modeling, ensuring the correct asymptotic limits with respect to both the Debye length and the mean free path. By coupling collision and transport processes within the numerical flux, the proposed approach effectively removes the hydrodynamic-limit constraint associated with the mean free path. In addition, a reformulated Poisson equation, coupled with the macroscopic moment equations, is introduced to overcome the inefficiency of the standard Poisson formulation in the quasineutral regime. The accuracy and asymptotic consistency of the proposed schemes are verified through several benchmark tests, including linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the bump-on-tail instability. The results demonstrate that the methods robustly capture plasma dynamics across hydrodynamic and quasineutral regimes, without resolution constraints imposed by either the Debye length or the mean free path.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Yee FDTD Scheme for Normal Incidence of Plane Waves on Dielectric and Magnetic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the accuracy of the standard Yee finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme for simulating normal incidence of harmonic plane waves on planar interfaces between lossless, linear, homogeneous, isotropic media. We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy.</description>

      <title>Permanent magnet optimization of stellarators with coupling from finite permeability and demagnetization effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permanent magnets provide an attractive path for shaping university-scale stellarator magnetic fields. Previous work has shown that greedy permanent magnet optimization (GPMO) can produce sparse, grid-aligned arrays that match target surfaces with high accuracy under an ideal rigid-remanence model. Here we extend this approach to a greedy permanent magnet optimization with macromagnetic refinement (GPMOmr) by introducing a block-level macromagnetic model that accounts for magnet-magnet and magnet-coil coupling from finite permeability and demagnetizing interactions, and apply it to the published magnet grid from the MUSE stellarator design. Finite-permeability effects produce degree-scale tilts and few-percent magnitude changes in individual magnets and modify the surface-normal field $\mathbf B\cdot\mathbf n$ only at the percent level, yet for a fixed layout they increase the standard squared-flux objective by more than a factor of two. When the same model is embedded in the greedy loop, GPMOmr achieves $f_B$ histories and final errors within a few percent of classical GPMO while producing visibly more nonuniform magnetization patterns. Our formulation provides a fast and practical tool for quantifying and incorporating finite-permeability effects in permanent-magnet stellarator designs, and offers a framework for extending permanent-magnet optimization to higher field strengths and to materials with stronger macromagnetic coupling.</description>

      <title>PIP$^2$ Net: Physics-informed Partition Penalty Deep Operator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>The study of coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering in multiple flow regimes using unified gas-kinetic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) holds great promise for the characterization of gas properties and the investigation of gas kinetic processes. The CRBS spectrum exhibits a strong dependence on the Knudsen number (Kn), revealing its inherently multiscale nature. In the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), collisions are intrinsically coupled with free transport during flux construction, endowing the method with distinct multiscale capabilities. Specifically, the UGKS reduces to a Boltzmann solver when the relaxation time is greater than or equal to the time step, and to the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS)-a Navier-Stokes solver-when the relaxation time is much smaller than the time step, thereby accommodating flow regimes without constraints on the molecular mean free path or collision time. In this study, the UGKS is extended to simulate CRBS phenomena, with the governing equation formulated based on the BGK-Shakhov model. Detailed derivations are provided. To account for the additional perturbation source term, a second-order accurate numerical algorithm is developed using the Strang splitting method within the UGKS framework. The proposed model is validated against argon CRBS experiments, demonstrating excellent agreement. Building on this validated framework, the impact of incident signal intensity on CRBS spectra across a range of Knudsen numbers is systematically examined, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. This work broadens the applicability of CFD-based CRBS simulations and provides a reliable numerical foundation for exploring high-intensity, multiscale gas-kinetic phenomena in future research.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stabilization of Defect Charge States and Finite-Temperature Charge Transition Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects introduce localized electronic states that critically affect carrier trapping, recombination, and transport in functional materials. The associated charge transition levels (CTLs) can depend on temperature, requiring accurate treatment of vibrational and electronic free-energy contributions. In this work, we use machine-learned interatomic potentials to efficiently compute temperature-dependent CTLs for vacancies in MgO, LiF, and CsSnBr3. Using thermodynamic integration, we quantify free-energy differences between charge states and calculate the vibrational entropy contributions at finite temperatures. We find that CTLs shift with temperature in MgO, LiF and CsSnBr3 from both entropy and electronic contributions. Notably, in CsSnBr3 a neutral charge state becomes thermodynamically stable above 60 K, introducing a temperature-dependent Fermi-level window absent at 0 K. We show that the widely used static, zero-kelvin defect formalism can miss both quantitative CTL shifts and the qualitative emergence of new stable charge states.</description>

      <title>Energy Inference of Black-Box Quantum Computers Using Quantum Speed Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computers do not provide users with access to hardware-level information such as the underlying Hamiltonians, which obstructs the characterization of their physical properties. We propose a method to infer the energy scales of gate Hamiltonians in such black-box quantum processors using only user-accessible data, by exploiting quantum speed limits. Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Fourier-Enhanced Deep Operator Network for Spatio-Temporal Propagation in Multi-Mode Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort-pulse propagation in graded-index multimode fibers is a highly nonlinear phenomenon driven by several physical processes. Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control. Moreover, the same framework can potentially be applied to a wide variety of wave systems exhibiting analogous nonlinear and dispersive effects in optics and beyond.</description>

      <title>QuantGraph: A Receding-Horizon Quantum Graph Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Stochastic Subspaces via the Bootstrap for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable forward uncertainty quantification in engineering requires methods that account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, upon absorbing rapid quantum fluctuations, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbital structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through bare particles used in most many-body computations, especially when fluctuations are strong such as in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. To decipher the dominant quantized structure, we propose an easy-to-implement `interaction annealing' approach that utilizes suppressed charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. We establish its theoretical foundation using an exactly treated two-site Hubbard model as a generic example. We then demonstrate its applications with more affordable density functional calculations to a representative $3d$ Mott insulator La${_2}$CuO${_4}$ and a highly fluctuating $5d$ semi-metal WTe${_2}$. In the latter, it reveals an emergent local electronic structure that makes possible an unprecedented explanation of several experimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in studying competing local electronic structures in functional materials.</description>

Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Robust and optimal loading of general classical data into quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As standard data loading processes, quantum state preparation and block-encoding are critical and necessary processes for quantum computing applications, including quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and many others. Yet, existing protocols suffer from poor robustness under device imperfection, thus limiting their practicality for real-world applications. Here, this limitation is overcome based on a fanin process designed in a tree-like bucket-brigade architecture. It suppresses the error propagation between different branches, thus exponentially improving the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. Moreover, the approach here simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant circuit depth, gate count, and STA. As an example of application, we show that for quantum simulation of geometrically local Hamiltonian, the code distance of each logic qubit can potentially be reduced exponentially using our technique. We believe that our technique can significantly enhance the power of quantum computing in the near-term and fault-tolerant regimes.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulations of the Non-Resonant Open Tavis-Cummings Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The open Tavis--Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis--Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogeneous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$, while the number of qubits used by these algorithms (space complexity) scales linearly as $O(N)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. &amp; Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. We benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver in a variety of scenarios and demonstrate that our algorithms accurately reproduce the expected dynamics.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>
