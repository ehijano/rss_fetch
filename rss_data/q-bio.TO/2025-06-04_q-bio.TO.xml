      <title>Integrating computational detection and experimental validation for rapid GFRAL-specific antibody discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification and validation of therapeutic antibodies is critical for developing effective treatments for many diseases. We present a computational approach for identifying antibodies targeting GFRAL-specific receptors, receptors implicated in appetite regulation. Using humanized Trianni mice, we conducted a longitudinal study with repeated blood sampling and splenic analysis. We applied the STAR computational method for antibody discovery on bulk antibody repertoire data sampled at key time points. By mapping the output from STAR to single-cell data taken at the last time point, we successfully identified a pool of antibodies, of which 50% demonstrated binding capabilities. We observed convergent selection, where responding sequences with identical amino acid complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) were found in different mice. We provide a catalog of 67 experimentally validated antibodies against GFRAL. The potential of these antibodies as antagonists or agonists against GFRAL suggests therapeutic solutions for conditions like cancer cachexia, anorexia, obesity, and diabetes. This study underscores the utility of integrating computational methods and experimental validation for antibody discovery in therapeutic contexts by reducing time and increasing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity, by using ``tunable degrees of freedom." We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>
