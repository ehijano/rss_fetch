      <title>Convergence and error control of consistent PINNs for elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an a priori analysis of a certain class of numerical methods, commonly referred to as collocation methods, for solving elliptic boundary value problems. They begin with information in the form of point values of the right side f of such equations and point values of the boundary function g and utilize only this information to numerically approximate the solution u of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE). For such a method to provide an approximation to u with guaranteed error bounds, additional assumptions on f and g, called model class assumptions, are needed. We determine the best error (in the energy norm) of approximating u, in terms of the number of point samples m, under all Besov class model assumptions for the right hand side $f$ and boundary g.
  We then turn to the study of numerical procedures and asks whether a proposed numerical procedure (nearly) achieves the optimal recovery error. We analyze numerical methods which generate the numerical approximation to $u$ by minimizing a specified data driven loss function over a set $\Sigma$ which is either a finite dimensional linear space, or more generally, a finite dimensional manifold. We show that the success of such a procedure depends critically on choosing a correct data driven loss function that is consistent with the PDE and provides sharp error control. Based on this analysis a loss function $L^*$ is proposed.
  We also address the recent methods of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Minimization of the new loss $L^*$ over neural network spaces $\Sigma$ is referred to as consistent PINNs (CPINNs). We prove that CPINNs provides an optimal recovery of the solution $u$, provided that the optimization problem can be numerically executed and $\Sigma$ has sufficient approximation capabilities. Finally, numerical examples illustrating the benefits of the CPINNs are given.</description>

      <title>Multigrid preconditioning for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of an elliptic optimal control problem with a convection-dominated state equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discontinuous Galerkin methods for an elliptic distributed optimal control problem constrained by a convection-dominated problem. We prove global optimal convergence rates using an inf-sup condition, with the diffusion parameter $\varepsilon$ and regularization parameter $\beta$ explicitly tracked. We then propose a multilevel preconditioner based on downwind ordering to solve the discretized system. The preconditioner only requires two approximate solves of single convection-dominated equations using multigrid methods. Moreover, for the strongly convection-dominated case, only two sweeps of block Gauss-Seidel iterations are needed. We also derive a simple bound indicating the role played by the multigrid preconditioner. Numerical results are shown to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Implicit Advection for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit time-stepping for advection is applied locally in space and time where Courant numbers are large, but standard explicit time-stepping is used for the remaining solution which is typically the majority. This adaptively implicit advection scheme facilitates efficient and robust integrations with long time-steps while having negligible impact on the overall accuracy, and achieving monotonicity and local conservation on general meshes. A novel and important aspect for the efficiency of the approach is that only one linear solver iteration is needed for each advection solve.
  The implementation in this paper uses a second-order Runge-Kutta implicit/explicit time-stepping in combination with a second/third-order finite volume spatial discretisation. We demonstrate the adaptively implicit advection in the context of deformational flow advection on the sphere and a fully compressible model for atmospheric flows. Tracers are advected over the poles of latitude-longitude grids with very large Courant numbers and through hexagonal and cubed-sphere meshes with the same algorithm. Buoyant flow simulations with strong local updrafts also benefit from adaptively implicit advection. Stably stratified flow simulations require a stable combination of implicit treatment of gravity and acoustic waves as well as advection in order to achieve long stable time-steps.</description>

      <title>Bengining overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Iductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning theory showed that interpolation to noisy samples using over-parameterized machine learning algorithms always leads to inconsistency. However, this work surprisingly discovers that interpolated machine learning can exhibit benign overfitting and consistency when using physics-informed learning for supervised tasks governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing laws of physics. An analysis provides an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression addressing linear inverse problems involving elliptic PDEs. The results reveal that the PDE operators can stabilize variance and lead to benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, contrasting standard regression settings. The impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as implicit regularization is also examined. Notably, the convergence rate is independent of the specific (smooth) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. For regularized least squares estimators, all (smooth enough) inductive biases can achieve optimal convergence rates when the regularization parameter is properly chosen. The smoothness requirement recovers a condition previously found in the Bayesian setting and extends conclusions to minimum norm interpolation estimators.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a mixed-dimensional poromechanical model with frictionless contact at matrix-fracture interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete numerical analysis for a general discretization of a coupled flow-mechanics model in fractured porous media, considering single-phase flows and including frictionless contact at matrix-fracture interfaces, as well as nonlinear poromechanical coupling. Fractures are described as planar surfaces, yielding the so-called mixed- or hybrid-dimensional models. Small displacements and a linear elastic behavior are considered for the matrix. The model accounts for discontinuous fluid pressures at matrix-fracture interfaces in order to cover a wide range of normal fracture conductivities. The numerical analysis is carried out in the Gradient Discretization framework, encompassing a large family of conforming and nonconforming discretizations. The convergence result also yields, as a by-product, the existence of a weak solution to the continuous model. A numerical experiment in 2D is presented to support the obtained result, employing a Hybrid Finite Volume scheme for the flow and second-order finite elements ($\mathbb P_2$) for the mechanical displacement coupled with face-wise constant ($\mathbb P_0$) Lagrange multipliers on fractures, representing normal stresses, to discretize the contact conditions.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Parareal Algorithm for subdiffusion equations with heterogeneous coefficients in a large time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Parareal (WEMP) Algorithm, recently proposed in [Li and Hu, {\it J. Comput. Phys.}, 2021], for efficiently solving subdiffusion equations with heterogeneous coefficients in long time. This algorithm combines the benefits of multiscale methods, which can handle heterogeneity in the spatial domain, and the strength of parareal algorithms for speeding up time evolution problems when sufficient processors are available. Our algorithm overcomes the challenge posed by the nonlocality of the fractional derivative in previous parabolic problem work by constructing an auxiliary problem on each coarse temporal subdomain to completely uncouple the temporal variable. We prove the approximation properties of the correction operator and derive a new summation of exponential to generate a single-step time stepping scheme, with the number of terms of $\mathcal{O}(|\log{\tau_f}|^2)$ independent of the final time, where $\tau_f$ is the fine-scale time step size. We establish the convergence rate of our algorithm in terms of the mesh size in the spatial domain, the level parameter used in the multiscale method, the coarse-scale time step size, and the fine-scale time step size. Finally, we present several numerical tests that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On Phase Unwrapping via Digital Wavefront Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new class of methods for phase unwrapping of 2D images based on digital wavefront sensors. Mathematically, many wavefront sensors produce the same measurements of incoming wavefronts regardless of whether they are wrapped or not. Since typical reconstructors for these sensors are optimized to compute smooth wavefronts, it is possible to digitally ``propagate'' a wrapped phase through such a sensor, resulting in a smooth unwrapped phase. First, we show how this principle can be applied for phase unwrapping using digital Shack-Hartmann and Fourier-type wavefront sensors. Then, we apply our methods to an unwrapping problem appearing in a real-world adaptive optics project currently under development, and compare the results to those obtained with other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning with generative models for object detection on limited datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of data is limited in some fields, especially for object detection tasks, where it is necessary to have correctly labeled bounding boxes around each object. A notable example of such data scarcity is found in the domain of marine biology, where it is useful to develop methods to automatically detect submarine species for environmental monitoring. To address this data limitation, the state-of-the-art machine learning strategies employ two main approaches. The first involves pretraining models on existing datasets before generalizing to the specific domain of interest. The second strategy is to create synthetic datasets specifically tailored to the target domain using methods like copy-paste techniques or ad-hoc simulators. The first strategy often faces a significant domain shift, while the second demands custom solutions crafted for the specific task. In response to these challenges, here we propose a transfer learning framework that is valid for a generic scenario. In this framework, generated images help to improve the performances of an object detector in a few-real data regime. This is achieved through a diffusion-based generative model that was pretrained on large generic datasets. With respect to the state-of-the-art, we find that it is not necessary to fine tune the generative model on the specific domain of interest. We believe that this is an important advance because it mitigates the labor-intensive task of manual labeling the images in object detection tasks. We validate our approach focusing on fishes in an underwater environment, and on the more common domain of cars in an urban setting. Our method achieves detection performance comparable to models trained on thousands of images, using only a few hundreds of input data. Our results pave the way for new generative AI-based protocols for machine learning applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate. By further analyzing concentration changes, this method reveals complex interactions among critical radicals across different temperature zones. The study investigates the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rates. In n-heptane dominant mixtures, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by additional ethanol impacts the heat release rate in the high-temperature zone through the diffusion of specific radicals such as \chto, \cthfo, \ctrhs, and \htot. In ethanol-dominant mixtures, higher ethanol fractions increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Best polynomial approximation for non-autonomous linear ODEs in the $\star$-product framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first formulation of the optimal polynomial approximation of the solution of linear non-autonomous systems of ODEs in the framework of the so-called $\star$-product. This product is the basis of new approaches for the solution of such ODEs, both in the analytical and the numerical sense. The paper shows how to formally state the problem and derives upper bounds for its error.</description>
