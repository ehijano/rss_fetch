      <title>Stackelberg Equilibria in Monopoly Insurance Markets with Probability Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg Equilibria (Bowley optima) in a monopolistic centralized sequential-move insurance market, with a profit-maximizing insurer who sets premia using a distortion premium principle, and a single policyholder who seeks to minimize a distortion risk measure. We show that equilibria are characterized as follows: In equilibrium, the optimal indemnity function exhibits a layer-type structure, providing full insurance over any loss layer on which the policyholder is more pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses; and no insurance coverage over loss layers on which the policyholder is less pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses. In equilibrium, the optimal pricing distortion function is determined by the policyholder's degree of risk aversion, whereby prices never exceed the policyholder's marginal willingness to insure tail losses. Moreover, we show that both the insurance coverage and the insurer's expected profit increase with the policyholder's degree of risk aversion. Additionally, and echoing recent work in the literature, we show that equilibrium contracts are Pareto efficient, but they do not induce a welfare gain to the policyholder. Conversely, any Pareto-optimal contract that leaves no welfare gain to the policyholder can be obtained as an equilibrium contract. Finally, we consider a few examples of interest that recover some existing results in the literature as special cases of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Computing Tarski Fixed Points in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern financial networks are highly connected and result in complex interdependencies of the involved institutions. In the prominent Eisenberg-Noe model, a fundamental aspect is clearing -- to determine the amount of assets available to each financial institution in the presence of potential defaults and bankruptcy. A clearing state represents a fixed point that satisfies a set of natural axioms. Existence can be established (even in broad generalizations of the model) using Tarski's theorem.
  While a maximal fixed point can be computed in polynomial time, the complexity of computing other fixed points is open. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute a minimal fixed point that runs in strongly polynomial time. It applies in a broad generalization of the Eisenberg-Noe model with any monotone, piecewise-linear payment functions and default costs. Moreover, in this scenario we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a maximal fixed point. For networks without default costs, we can efficiently decide the existence of fixed points in a given range.
  We also study claims trading, a local network adjustment to improve clearing, when networks are evaluated with minimal clearing. We provide an efficient algorithm to decide existence of Pareto-improving trades and compute optimal ones if they exist.</description>

      <title>From Chain-Ladder to Individual Claims Reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chain-ladder (CL) method is the most widely used claims reserving technique in non-life insurance. This manuscript introduces a novel approach to computing the CL reserves based on a fundamental restructuring of the data utilization for the CL prediction procedure. Instead of rolling forward the cumulative claims with estimated CL factors, we estimate multi-period factors that project the latest observations directly to the ultimate claims. This alternative perspective on CL reserving creates a natural pathway for the application of machine learning techniques to individual claims reserving. As a proof of concept, we present a small-scale real data application employing neural networks for individual claims reserving.</description>
