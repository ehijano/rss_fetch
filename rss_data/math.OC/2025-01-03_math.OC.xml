      <title>Community detection by simulated bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems. This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity, matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving community detection problems.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Approach to Risk-aware Robust Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes risk-averse and risk-agnostic formulations to robust design in which solutions that satisfy the system requirements for a set of scenarios are pursued. These scenarios, which correspond to realizations of uncertain parameters or varying operating conditions, can be obtained either experimentally or synthetically. The proposed designs are made robust to variations in the training data by considering perturbed scenarios. This practice allows accounting for error and uncertainty in the measurements, thereby preventing data overfitting. Furthermore, we use relaxation to trade-off a lower optimal objective value against lesser robustness to uncertainty. This is attained by eliminating a given number of optimally chosen outliers from the dataset, and by allowing for the perturbed scenarios to violate the requirements with an acceptably small probability. For instance, we can pursue a riskier design that attains a lower objective value in exchange for a few scenarios violating the requirements, or we might seek a more conservative design that satisfies the requirements for as many perturbed scenarios as possible. The design of a flexible wing subject to aeroelastic constraints is used for illustration.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Control: Complete Stable Inversion with Necessary and Sufficient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learning-based control have increased interest in stable inversion to meet growing performance demands. Here, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stable inversion, addressing challenges in non-minimum phase, non-square, and singular systems. An H-Infinity based algebraic approximation is introduced for near-perfect tracking without preview. Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithm Design of Dynamic Spectrum Access by Whittle Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the dynamic spectrum access problem in a wireless sub-network that shares channels with a parent network. We approach the sequential channel allocation problem using a restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) framework. Our objective is to maximize the expected discounted return over an infinite horizon while minimizing interference to the parent network caused by shared channels with the sub-network. Due to the unavailability of direct observations of the true channel state, we leverage the channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback provided by users. However, the RMAB problem is widely acknowledged as PSPACE-hard even for finite-state models. To overcome this challenge, we propose a closed-form channel index function using an iterative online approximation method to approximate the well-known Whittle index policy, which offers a low-complexity solution for ranking the available channels that has an infinite state space. Through extensive numerical simulation experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Third-order Tensor Methods with Adaptive Regularization for Unconstrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order tensor methods that employ Taylor-based local models of positive integer degree $p$ within adaptive regularization frameworks have recently garnered significant research interest for both convex and nonconvex optimization problems. The well-known $p$th-order adaptive regularization (AR$p$) method has demonstrated optimal worst-case global convergence rates and local convergence rates. At each iteration of this method, a local model of the objective function, consisting of a $p$th-order Taylor approximation and a $(p+1)$th-order regularization term, is minimized. However, for $p \geq 2$, the subproblem typically contains multiple local minima. It is recommended to solve the subproblem globally when $p = 2$, as the global minimizer is guaranteed to be a descent direction. However, for any $p \geq 3$, it remains an open question how to efficiently minimize the subproblem and which minimizer to select. In this context, designing efficient AR$p$ variants is a critical area of interest, especially for $p \geq 3$. In this paper, we extend the interpolation-based updating strategies, originally introduced by Gould, Porcelli, and Toint in 2012 for $p = 2$, to cases where $p \geq 3$. This updating strategy enables the regularization parameter to adjust adaptively based on interpolation models. We propose a novel prerejection mechanism that rejects unwanted subproblem minimizers prior to any function evaluations, thereby reducing computational costs for $p\geq 3$. Numerical results illustrate how the proposed interpolation-based updating strategy and the prerejection mechanism for $p = 3$ enhance the overall numerical performance.</description>

      <title>Projected subgradient methods for paraconvex optimization: Application to robust low-rank matrix recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the class of paraconvex functions and presents some of its fundamental properties, characterization, and examples that can be used for their recognition and optimization. Next, the convergence analysis of the projected subgradient methods with several step-sizes (i.e., constant, nonsummable, square-summable but not summable, geometrically decaying, and Scaled Polyak's step-sizes) to global minima for this class of functions is studied. In particular, the convergence rate of the proposed methods is investigated under paraconvexity and the H\"{o}lderian error bound condition, where the latter is an extension of the classical error bound condition. The preliminary numerical experiments on several robust low-rank matrix recovery problems (i.e., robust matrix completion, image inpainting, robust nonnegative matrix factorization, robust matrix compression) indicate promising behavior for these projected subgradient methods, validating our theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>Randomized directional search for nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct search methods are a class of popular global optimization algorithms for general nonconvex programs. In this paper, we propose a randomized directional search algorithm (RDSA) for globally solving nonconvex optimization problems. The convergence of RDSA to a global optimizer is established and its computational complexity is derived. Additionally, IRDSA is proposed as an improved algorithm of RDSA. We then apply both RDSA and IRDSA to nonconvex programs with multiple local optima. Results demonstrate that RDSA and IRDSA exhibit remarkable efficacy to identify the global optimum and outperform other global optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization for square root principal component pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the square root principal component pursuit (SRPCP) model has garnered significant research interest. It is shown in the literature that the SRPCP model guarantees robust matrix recovery with a universal, constant penalty parameter. While its statistical advantages are well-documented, the computational aspects from an optimization perspective remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we focus on developing efficient optimization algorithms for solving the SRPCP problem. Specifically, we propose a tuning-free alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm, where each iteration involves subproblems enjoying closed-form optimal solutions. Additionally, we introduce techniques based on the variational formulation of the nuclear norm and Burer-Monteiro decomposition to further accelerate the AltMin method. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and robustness of our algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of ChatGPT in the domain of Robust and Adaptive Robust Optimization. We demonstrate that with appropriate prompting, ChatGPT can be used to auto-formulate and solve simple Robust and Adaptive Optimization Problems. We first develop specialized informational prompts tailored to the domains of Adaptive and Robust Optimization. Then, we show that using these prompts, ChatGPT is able to (i) formulate an optimization problem, (ii) adapt the problem so that it accounts for user-specified uncertainty, (iii) derive the computationally tractable robust counterpart of the problem and (iv) produce executable code that solves the problem. For simple Optimization Problems, we show that ChatGPT is able to perform these steps with little to no errors. We also highlight some instances of erroneous execution of the steps. Overall, we show that using in-context learning, ChatGPT has the potential to adapt to higlhy specialized and niche domains, in which it would otherwise demonstrate very poor out-of-the-box performance.</description>

      <title>Proximity results in convex mixed-integer programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study proximity (resp. integrality gap), that is, the distance (resp. difference) between the optimal solutions (resp. optimal values) of convex integer programs (IP) and the optimal solutions (resp. optimal values) of their continuous relaxations. We show that these values can be upper bounded in terms of the recession cone of the feasible region of the continuous relaxation when the recession cone is full-dimensional. If the recession cone is not full-dimensional we give sufficient conditions to obtain a finite integrality gap. We then specialize our analysis to second-order conic IPs. In the case the feasible region is defined by a single Lorentz cone constraint, we give upper bounds on proximity and integrality gap in terms of the data of the problem (the objective function vector, the matrix defining the conic constraint, the right-hand side, and the covering radius of a related lattice). We also give conditions for these bounds to be independent of the right-hand side, akin to the linear IP case. Finally, in the case the feasible region is defined by multiple Lorentz cone constraints, we show that, in general, we cannot give bounds that are independent of the corresponding right-hand side. Although our results are presented for the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$, the bounds can be easily adapted to work for any general lattice, including the usual mixed-integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n_1}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$, by considering the appropriate covering radius when needed.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of dynamic flexible multibody systems using the discrete adjoint variable method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design space of dynamic multibody systems (MBSs), particularly those with flexible components, is considerably large. Consequently, having a means to efficiently explore this space and find the optimum solution within a feasible timeframe is crucial. It is well known that for problems with several design variables, sensitivity analysis using the adjoint variable method extensively reduces the computational costs. This paper presents the novel extension of the discrete adjoint variable method to the design optimization of dynamic flexible MBSs. The extension involves deriving the adjoint equations directly from the discrete, rather than the continuous, equations of motion. This results in a system of algebraic equations that is computationally less demanding to solve compared to the system of differential algebraic equations produced by the continuous adjoint variable method. To describe the proposed method, it is integrated with a numerical time-stepping algorithm based on geometric variational integrators. The developed technique is then applied to the optimization of MBSs composed of springs, dampers, beams and rigid bodies, considering both geometrical (e.g., positions of joints) and non-geometrical (e.g., mechanical properties of components) design variables. To validate the developed methods and show their applicability, three numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Unsupervised Feature Selection via Double Sparsity Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is widely applied in machine learning and pattern recognition. However, most of the existing methods only consider a single sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative feature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper, we propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity constrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Double sparsity refers to using $\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\ell_0$-norm to simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different types, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying differential features. The core is that $\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant and redundant features, while $\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy features, thereby complementing $\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An effective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the resulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point. Numerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed method. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, two common statistical tests and a new feature similarity metric verify the advantages of double sparsity. All results suggest that our proposed DSCOFS provides a new perspective for feature selection.</description>

      <title>High-Probability Polynomial-Time Complexity of Restarted PDHG for Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (rPDHG) is a first-order method that has recently received significant attention for its computational effectiveness in solving linear program (LP) problems. Despite its impressive practical performance, the theoretical iteration bounds for rPDHG can be exponentially poor. To shrink this gap between theory and practice, we show that rPDHG achieves polynomial-time complexity in a high-probability sense, under assumptions on the probability distribution from which the data instance is generated. We consider not only Gaussian distribution models but also sub-Gaussian distribution models as well. For standard-form LP instances with $m$ linear constraints and $n$ decision variables, we prove that rPDHG iterates settle on the optimal basis in $\widetilde{O}\left(\tfrac{n^{2.5}m^{0.5}}{\delta}\right)$ iterations, followed by $O\left(\frac{n^{0.5}m^{0.5}}{\delta}\ln\big(\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\big)\right)$ iterations to compute an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. These bounds hold with probability at least $1-\delta$ for $\delta$ that is not exponentially small. The first-stage bound further improves to $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{2.5}}{\delta}\right)$ in the Gaussian distribution model. Experimental results confirm the tail behavior and the polynomial-time dependence on problem dimensions of the iteration counts. As an application of our probabilistic analysis, we explore how the disparity among the components of the optimal solution bears on the performance of rPDHG, and we provide guidelines for generating challenging LP test instance.</description>

      <title>Public Access Defibrillator Deployment for Cardiac Arrests: A Learn-Then-Optimize Approach with SHAP-based Interpretable Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival rates remain extremely low due to challenges in the timely accessibility of medical devices. Therefore, effective deployment of automated external defibrillators (AED) can significantly increase survival rates. Precise and interpretable predictions of OHCA occurrences provide a solid foundation for efficient and robust AED deployment optimization. This study develops a novel learn-then-optimize approach, integrating three key components: a machine learning prediction model, SHAP-based interpretable analytics, and a SHAP-guided integer programming (SIP) model. The machine learning model is trained utilizing only geographic data as inputs to overcome data availability obstacles, and its strong predictive performance validates the feasibility of interpretation. Furthermore, the SHAP model elaborates on the contribution of each geographic feature to the OHCA occurrences. Finally, an integer programming model is formulated for optimizing AED deployment, incorporating SHAP-weighted OHCA densities. Various numerical experiments are conducted across different settings. Based on comparative and sensitive analysis, the optimization effect of our approach is verified and valuable insights are derived to provide substantial support for theoretical extension and practical implementation.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of piecewise linear approximation for the control of nonlinear systems, particularly focusing on the effective linearization of systems modeled by the differential equation y^(n) + f(y,y',...,y^(n-1)) = u(t). We explore the use of PID controllers in conjunction with piecewise linearization, tackling the challenges of nonlinear dynamics by dividing the function f into smaller regions or simplices over a predefined compact set D subset of R^n. The parameter h determines the number of linear pieces and influences the approximation accuracy. By increasing h, the system's behavior increasingly mirrors that of the original nonlinear system, leading to enhanced performance of the control system. The paper further discusses the optimization of PID controller parameters through the Particle Swarm Optimization method, with a focus on minimizing the ITAE and ISO criteria. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, highlighting the trade-off between computational complexity and approximation accuracy in the context of control system design.</description>

      <title>Optimal $L^p$-approximation of convex sets by convex subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a convex set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the shape optimization problem of finding a convex subset $\omega\subset \Omega$, of a given measure, minimizing the $p$-distance functional $$\mathcal{J}_p(\omega) := \left(\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} |h_\Omega-h_\omega|^p d\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}},$$ where $1 \le p &lt;\infty$ and $h_\omega$ and $h_\Omega$ are the support functions of $\omega$ and the fixed container $\Omega$, respectively.
  We prove the existence of solutions and show that this minimization problem $\Gamma$-converges, when $p$ tends to $+\infty$, towards the problem of finding a convex subset $\omega\subset \Omega$, of a given measure, minimizing the Hausdorff distance to the convex $\Omega$.
  In the planar case, we show that the free parts of the boundary of the optimal shapes, i.e., those that are in the interior of $\Omega$, are given by polygonal lines.
  Still in the $2-d$ setting, from a computational perspective, the classical method based on optimizing Fourier coefficients of support functions is not efficient, as it is unable to efficiently capture the presence of segments on the boundary of optimal shapes. We subsequently propose a method combining Fourier analysis and a recent numerical scheme, allowing to obtain accurate results, as demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Tight Constraint Prediction of Six-Degree-of-Freedom Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control for Mean-Field Stochastic Differential Equations in Infinite-Horizon with Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with stochastic linear quadratic (LQ, for short) optimal control problems in an infinite horizon with conditional mean-field term in a switching regime environment. The orthogonal decomposition introduced in [21] has been adopted. Desired algebraic Riccati equations (AREs, for short) and a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs, for short) in infinite time horizon with the coefficients depending on the Markov chain have been derived. The determination of closed-loop optimal strategy follows from the solvability of ARE and BSDE. Moreover, the solvability of BSDEs leads to a characterization of open-loop solvability of the optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Bi-Parameterized Two-Stage Stochastic Min-Max and Min-Min Mixed Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two-stage stochastic min-max and min-min integer programs with bi-parameterized recourse (BTSPs), where the first-stage decisions affect both the objective function and the feasible region of the second-stage problem. To solve these programs efficiently, we introduce Lagrangian-integrated L-shaped ($L^2$) methods, which guarantee exact solutions when the first-stage decisions are pure binary. For mixed-binary first-stage programs, we present a regularization-augmented variant of this method. We also introduce distributionally robust bi-parameterized two-stage stochastic integer programs and present an extension of the $L^2$ method and a reformulation-based method for programs with finite and continuous supports, respectively. Our computational results show that the $L^2$ method surpasses the benchmark method for bi-parameterized stochastic network interdiction problems, solving all instances in 23 seconds on average, whereas the benchmark method failed to solve any instance within 3600 seconds. Additionally, it achieves optimal solutions up to 18.4 and 1.7 times faster for instances of risk-neutral and distributionally robust bi-parameterized stochastic facility location problems, respectively. Furthermore, BTSPs have applications in solving stochastic problems with decision-dependent probability distributions or sets of distributions (ambiguity set). The $L^2$ method outperforms existing approaches, achieving optimal solutions 5.3 times faster for distributionally robust facility location problem with a decision-dependent and non-relatively complete ambiguity set.</description>

      <title>Lagrange Multipliers and Duality with Applications to Constrained Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the concept of quasi-relative interior to analyze the method of Lagrange multipliers and establish strong Lagrangian duality for nonsmooth convex optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. Then, we generalize the classical support vector machine (SVM) model by incorporating a new geometric constraint or a regularizer on the separating hyperplane, serving as a regularization mechanism for the SVM. This new SVM model is examined using Lagrangian duality and other convex optimization techniques in both theoretical and numerical aspects via a new subgradient algorithm as well as a primal-dual method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the combination of theoretical results on Blaschke--Santal\'o diagrams and numerical shape optimization techniques to obtain improved description of Blaschke--Santal\'o diagrams in the class of planar convex sets. To illustrate our approach, we study three relevant diagrams involving the perimeter $P$, the diameter $d$, the area $A$ and the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary condition $\lambda_1$. The first diagram is a purely geometric one involving the triplet $(P,d,A)$ and the two other diagrams involve geometric and spectral functionals, namely $(P,\lambda_1,A)$ and $(d,\lambda_1,A)$ where a strange phenomenon of non-continuity of the extremal shapes is observed.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Network Constrained Markets with Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a networked economic system composed of $n$ producers supplying a single homogeneous good to a number of geographically separated markets and of a centralized authority, called the market maker. Producers compete \`a la Cournot, by choosing the quantities of good to supply to each market they have access to in order to maximize their profit. Every market is characterized by its inverse demand functions returning the unit price of the considered good as a function of the total available quantity. Markets are interconnected by a dispatch network through which quantities of the considered good can flow within finite capacity constraints. Such flows are determined by the market maker, who aims at maximizing a designated welfare function. We model such competition as a strategic game with $n+1$ players: the producers and the market game. For this game, we first establish the existence of Nash equilibria under standard concavity assumptions. We then identify sufficient conditions for the game to be potential with an essentially unique Nash equilibrium. Next, we present a general result that connects the optimal action of the market maker with the capacity constraints imposed on the network. For the commonly used Walrasian welfare, our finding proves a connection between capacity bottlenecks in the market network and the emergence of price differences between markets separated by saturated lines. This phenomenon is frequently observed in real-world scenarios, for instance in power networks. Finally, we validate the model with data from the Italian day-ahead electricity market.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Network Verification with Branch-and-bound Inferred Cutting Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, cutting-plane methods such as GCP-CROWN have been explored to enhance neural network verifiers and made significant advances. However, GCP-CROWN currently relies on generic cutting planes (cuts) generated from external mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. Due to the poor scalability of MIP solvers, large neural networks cannot benefit from these cutting planes. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the neural network verification problem to generate efficient and scalable cutting planes specific for this problem setting. We propose a novel approach, Branch-and-bound Inferred Cuts with COnstraint Strengthening (BICCOS), which leverages the logical relationships of neurons within verified subproblems in the branch-and-bound search tree, and we introduce cuts that preclude these relationships in other subproblems. We develop a mechanism that assigns influence scores to neurons in each path to allow the strengthening of these cuts. Furthermore, we design a multi-tree search technique to identify more cuts, effectively narrowing the search space and accelerating the BaB algorithm. Our results demonstrate that BICCOS can generate hundreds of useful cuts during the branch-and-bound process and consistently increase the number of verifiable instances compared to other state-of-the-art neural network verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks, including large networks that previous cutting plane methods could not scale to. BICCOS is part of the $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier, the VNN-COMP 2024 winner. The code is available at http://github.com/Lemutisme/BICCOS .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of autonomous minibuses which take on-demand directional routes for pick-up and drop-off in a grid network of wider area with low density, followed by fixed routes in areas with demand. Mathematical formulation for generalized costs demonstrates its benefits, with indicators proposed to select existing bus routes for conversion with the options of zonal express and parallel routes. Simulations on modeled scenarios and case studies with bus routes in Chicago show reductions in both passenger costs and generalized costs over existing fixed-route bus service between suburban areas and CBD.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of frame structures with mixed categorical and continuous design variables using the Gumbel-Softmax method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimizing real-world structures, due to fabrication or budgetary restraints, the design variables may be restricted to a set of standard engineering choices. Such variables, commonly called categorical variables, are discrete and unordered in essence, precluding the utilization of gradient-based optimizers for the problems containing them. In this paper, incorporating the Gumbel-Softmax (GSM) method, we propose a new gradient-based optimizer for handling such variables in the optimal design of large-scale frame structures. The GSM method provides a means to draw differentiable samples from categorical distributions, thereby enabling sensitivity analysis for the variables generated from such distributions. The sensitivity information can greatly reduce the computational cost of traversing high-dimensional and discrete design spaces in comparison to employing gradient-free optimization methods. In addition, since the developed optimizer is gradient-based, it can naturally handle the simultaneous optimization of categorical and continuous design variables. Through three numerical case studies, different aspects of the proposed optimizer are studied and its advantages over population-based optimizers, specifically a genetic algorithm, are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Extragradient with Flip-Flop Shuffling &amp; Anchoring: Provable Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been extensively studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent method in convex-concave (C-C) problems. Yet, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen limited success in C-C problems, especially for unconstrained cases. Motivated by the recent progress of shuffling-based stochastic methods, we investigate the convergence of shuffling-based SEG in unconstrained finite-sum minimax problems, in search of convergent shuffling-based SEG. Our analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the recently proposed flip-flop shuffling alone can suffer divergence in C-C problems. However, with an additional simple trick called anchoring, we develop the SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method which successfully converges in C-C problems. We also show upper and lower bounds in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, demonstrating that SEG-FFA has a provably faster convergence rate compared to other shuffling-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a system of Schr\"odinger's problems and functional equations in probability theory. More precisely, we consider a system of variational problems of relative entropies for probability measures with given two endpoint marginals, which can be defined inductively. We also consider an inductively defined system of functional equations, which are Euler's equations for our variational problems. These are generalizations of Schr\"odinger's problem and functional equation in probability theory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to our functional equations up to a multiplicative function, from which we show the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of our variational problem. Our problem gives an approach for a stochastic optimal transport analog of the Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement from a variational problem point of view.</description>

      <title>Follow The Sparse Approximate Leader for No-Regret Online Sparse Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESA/NASA joint LISA (laser interferometer space antenna) mission is designed to detect gravitational waves, which relies crucially on maintaining three-spacecraft constellation as close to an equilateral triangle with a designed distance as possible. Efforts have been made to achieve this goal by using various simplified models to make it easy to approximately solve the complex problem. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem using exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations. It is shown that the optimal solution based on the exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations gives a better solution than the previously obtained ones.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Anonymization of Structured Data for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is essential for secondary use, but ensuring its privacy while allowing such use is a critical challenge. Various techniques have been proposed to address privacy concerns in data sharing and publishing. However, these methods often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables, assessing data utility, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases. Additionally, our model maintains comparative ML performance relative to the original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance, offering a comprehensive framework for balancing privacy and utility in data sharing.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Stable Optimal Guidance for Spacecraft Close-Proximity Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving autonomy and optimality for nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamical systems. However, traditional black-box machine learning methods often lack formal stability guarantees, which are critical for safety-sensitive aerospace applications. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework that combines control Lyapunov functions with supervised learning to provide certifiably stable, time- and fuel-optimal guidance for rendezvous maneuvers governed by Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics. The framework is easily extensible to nonlinear control-affine systems. A novel neural candidate Lyapunov function is developed to ensure positive definiteness. Subsequently, a control policy is defined, in which the thrust direction vector minimizes the Lyapunov function's time derivative, and the thrust throttle is determined using minimal required throttle. This approach ensures that all loss terms related to the control Lyapunov function are either naturally satisfied or replaced by the derived control policy. To jointly supervise the Lyapunov function and the control policy, a simple loss function is introduced, leveraging optimal state-control pairs obtained by a polynomial maps based method. Consequently, the trained neural network not only certifies the Lyapunov function but also generates a near-optimal guidance policy, even for the bang-bang fuel-optimal problem. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Model of an Open, Decentralized Computational Network with Incentive-Based Load Balancing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model that enables permissionless and decentralized networks for complex computations. We explore the integration and optimize load balancing in an open, decentralized computational network. Our model leverages economic incentives and reputation-based mechanisms to dynamically allocate tasks between operators and coprocessors. This approach eliminates the need for specialized hardware or software, thereby reducing operational costs and complexities. We present a mathematical model that enhances restaking processes in blockchain systems by enabling operators to delegate complex tasks to coprocessors. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental simulations, showcasing its ability to optimize reward distribution, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency.
  Our approach facilitates a more flexible and scalable network through the use of economic commitments, adaptable dynamic rating models, and a coprocessor load incentivization system. Supported by experimental simulations, the model demonstrates its capability to optimize resource allocation, enhance system resilience, and reduce operational risks. This ensures significant improvements in both security and cost-efficiency for the blockchain ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative observability for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the observability inequalities for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation associated with an anharmonic oscillator $H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|$. We build up the observability inequality over an arbitrarily short time interval $(0,T)$, with an explicit expression for the observation constant $C_{obs}$ in terms of $T$, for some observable set that has a different geometric structure compared to those discussed in \cite{HWW}. We obtain the sufficient conditions and the necessary conditions for observable sets, respectively. We also present counterexamples to demonstrate that half-lines are not observable sets, highlighting a major difference in the geometric properties of observable sets compared to those of Schr\"{o}dinger operators $H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|^{2m}$ with $m\ge 1$.
  Our approach is based on the following ingredients: First, the use of an Ingham-type spectral inequality constructed in this paper; second, the adaptation of a quantitative unique compactness argument, inspired by the work of Bourgain-Burq-Zworski \cite{Bour13}; third, the application of the Szeg\"{o}'s limit theorem from the theory of Toeplitz matrices, which provides a new mathematical tool for proving counterexamples of observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Jacobi-type Newton method for Nash equilibrium problems with descent guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common strategy for solving an unconstrained two-player Nash equilibrium problem with continuous variables is applying Newton's method to the system of nonlinear equations obtained by the corresponding first-order necessary optimality conditions. However, when taking into account the game dynamics, it is not clear what is the goal of each player when considering that they are taking their current decision following Newton's iterates. In this paper we provide an interpretation for Newton's iterate in view of the game dynamics as follows: instead of minimizing the quadratic approximation of their objective function parameterized by the other player current decision (as a typical Jacobi-type strategy), we show that the Newton iterate follows this approach but with the objective function parameterized by a prediction of the other player action, considering that they are following the same Newtonian strategy. This interpretation allows us to present a new Newtonian algorithm where a backtracking procedure is introduced in order to guarantee that the computed Newtonian directions, for each player, are descent directions for their corresponding parameterized functions. Thus, besides favoring global convergence, our algorithm also favors true minimizers instead of maximizers or saddle points, differently from the standard Newton method, which does not consider the minimization structure of the problem in the non-convex case. Thus, our method is more robust in comparison with other Jacobi-type strategies or the pure Newtonian approach, which is corroborated by our illustrative numerical experiments. We also present a proof of the well-definiteness of the algorithm under some standard assumptions, together with a thorough analysis of its convergence properties taking into account the game dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing and the stable set problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph, the stable set problem asks to determine the cardinality of the largest subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. This value is called the stability number of the graph, and its computation is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we solve the stable set problem using the D-wave quantum annealer. By formulating the problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem with the penalty method, we show its optimal value equals the graph's stability number for specific penalty values. However, D-Wave's quantum annealer is a heuristic, so the solutions may be far from the optimum and may not represent stable sets. To address these, we introduce a post-processing procedure that identifies samples that could lead to improved solutions. Additionally, we propose a partitioning method to handle larger instances that cannot be embedded on D-Wave's quantum processing unit. Finally, we investigate how different penalty parameter values affect the solutions' quality. Extensive computational results show that the post-processing procedure significantly improves the solution quality, while the partitioning method successfully extends our approach to medium-size instances.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics for Signed Measures via a Bilevel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MLFD) is a class of interacting particle methods that tackle convex optimization over probability measures on a manifold, which are scalable, versatile, and enjoy computational guarantees. However, some important problems -- such as risk minimization for infinite width two-layer neural networks, or sparse deconvolution -- are originally defined over the set of signed, rather than probability, measures. In this paper, we investigate how to extend the MFLD framework to convex optimization problems over signed measures. Among two known reductions from signed to probability measures -- the lifting and the bilevel approaches -- we show that the bilevel reduction leads to stronger guarantees and faster rates (at the price of a higher per-iteration complexity). In particular, we investigate the convergence rate of MFLD applied to the bilevel reduction in the low-noise regime and obtain two results. First, this dynamics is amenable to an annealing schedule, adapted from Suzuki et al. (2023), that results in improved convergence rates to a fixed multiplicative accuracy. Second, we investigate the problem of learning a single neuron with the bilevel approach and obtain local exponential convergence rates that depend polynomially on the dimension and noise level (to compare with the exponential dependence that would result from prior analyses).</description>

      <title>On pairs of spectrum maximizing products with distinct factor multiplicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, J. Bochi and P. Laskawiec constructed an example of a set of matrices $\{A,B\}$ having two different (up to cyclic permutations of factors) spectrum maximizing products, $AABABB$ and $BBABAA$. In this paper, we identify a class of matrix sets for which the existence of at least one spectrum maximizing product with an odd number of factors automatically entails the existence of another spectrum maximizing product. Moreover, in addition to Bochi--Laskawiec's example, the number of factors of the same name (factors of the form $A$ or $B$) in these matrix products turns out to be different. The efficiency of the proposed approach is confirmed by constructing an example of a set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{A,B\}$ that has spectrum maximizing products of the form $BAA$ and $BBA$.</description>

      <title>The Non-Substitution Theorem, Uniqueness of Solution and Convex combinations of basic optimal solutions for linear optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14150v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our first result is a statement of a somewhat general form of a non-substitution theorem for linear programming problems, along with a very easy proof of the same. Subsequently, we provide an easy proof of theorem 1 in a 1979 paper of Olvi L. Mangasarian, based on a new result in terms of two statements that are each equivalent to a given solution of a linear programming problem being its unique solution. We also provide a simple proof of the result that states that the set of optimal solutions of a bounded linear optimization problem is the set of all convex combinations of its basic optimal solutions and the set of basic optimal solutions are the extreme points of the set of optimal solutions. We do so by appealing to the lemma due to Farkas and the well-known result that states that if a linear optimization problem has an optimal solution, it has at least one basic optimal solution. Both results we appeal to have easy proofs. We do not appeal to any version of the Klein-Milman Theorem or any result in advanced polyhedral combinatorics to obtain our results. As an application of this result, we obtain a simple proof of the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem.</description>

      <title>Modular Vehicle Routing Problem: Applications in Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies and industry advancements indicate that modular vehicles (MVs) have the potential to enhance transportation systems through their ability to dock and split during a trip. Although various applications of MVs have been explored across different domains, their application in logistics remains underexplored. This study examines the use of MVs in cargo delivery to reduce total delivery costs. We model the delivery problem for MVs as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem, referred to as the Modular Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP). In the MVRP, MVs can either serve customers independently or dock with other MVs to form a platoon, thereby reducing the average cost per unit. In this study, we mainly focus on two fundamental types of MVRPs, namely the capacitated MVRP and the MVRP with time windows. To address these problems, we first developed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models, which can be solved using commercial optimization solvers. Given the NP-hardness of this problem, we also designed a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm with a solution representation based on Gantt charts and a neighborhood structure tailored for the MVRP. Multi-start and shaking strategies were incorporated into the TS algorithm to escape local optima. Additionally, we explored other potential applications in logistics and discussed problem settings for three MVRP variants. Results from numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm successfully identifies nearly all optimal solutions found by the MILP model in small-size benchmark instances, while also demonstrating good convergence speed in large-size benchmark instances. Comparative experiments show that the MVRP approach can reduce costs by approximately 5.6\% compared to traditional delivery methods. Sensitivity analyses reveal that improving the cost-saving capability of MV platooning can enhance overall benefits.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>On the Trade-Off Between Distributional Belief and Ambiguity: Conservatism, Finite-Sample Guarantees, and Asymptotic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new data-driven trade-off (TRO) approach for modeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic approach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic distributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against distributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set characterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape parameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that constructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter with the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets. Then, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying conservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing asymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate a spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions. Additionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true optimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true counterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control problem and a portfolio optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Distributionally Robust Nash Equilibrium and Its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent work by Shapiro et al. [45], we propose a Bayesian distributionally robust Nash equilibrium (BDRNE) model where each player lacks complete information on the true probability distribution of the underlying uncertainty represented by a random variable and subsequently determines the optimal decision by solving a Bayesian distributionally robust optimization (BDRO) problem under the Nash conjecture. Unlike most of the DRO models in the literature, the BDRO model assumes (a) the true unknown distribution of the random variable can be approximated by a randomized parametric family of distributions, (b) the average of the worst-case expected value of the objective function with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter, instead of the worst-case expected value of the objective function is considered in each player's decision making, and (c) the posterior distribution of the parameter is updated as more and more sampling information of the random variable is gathered. Under some moderate conditions, we demonstrate the existence of a BDRNE and derive asymptotic convergence of the equilibrium as the sample size increases. Moreover, we propose to solve the BDRNE problem by Gauss-Seidel-type iterative method in the case when the ambiguity set of each player is constructed via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Finally, we apply the BDRNE model to a price competition problem under multinomial logit demand. The preliminary numerical test results show that the proposed model and computational scheme perform well.</description>

      <title>Partially Observed Optimal Stochastic Control: Regularity, Optimality, Approximations, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.</description>

      <title>Local Identifiability of Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization Framework for Merton's Portfolio Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework for Merton's portfolio problem, unifying modern neural-network-based policy parameterization with the costate (adjoint) viewpoint from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP). Instead of approximating the value function (as in "Deep BSDE"), we track a policy-fixed backward SDE for the adjoint variables, allowing each gradient update to align with continuous-time PMP conditions. This setup yields locally optimal consumption and investment policies that are closely tied to classical stochastic control. We further incorporate an alignment penalty that nudges the learned policy toward Pontryagin-derived solutions, enhancing both convergence speed and training stability. Numerical experiments confirm that PG-DPO effectively accommodates both consumption and investment, achieving strong performance and interpretability without requiring large offline datasets or model-free reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal error estimates of the stochastic parabolic optimal control problem with integral state constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the optimal strong error estimates for stochastic parabolic optimal control problem with additive noise and integral state constraint are derived based on time-implicit and finite element discretization. The continuous and discrete first-order optimality conditions are deduced by constructing the Lagrange functional, which contains forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations and a variational equation. The fully discrete version of forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations is introduced as an auxiliary problem and the optimal strong convergence orders are estimated, which further allows the optimal a priori error estimates for control, state, adjoint state and multiplier to be derived. Then, a simple and yet efficient gradient projection algorithm is proposed to solve stochastic parabolic control problem and its convergence rate is proved. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the GPU implementation of the general-purpose interior-point solver Clarabel for convex optimization problems with conic constraints. We introduce a mixed parallel computing strategy that processes linear constraints first, then handles other conic constraints in parallel. This mixed parallel computing strategy currently supports linear, second-order cone, exponential cone, and power cone constraints. We demonstrate that integrating a mixed parallel computing strategy with GPU-based direct linear system solvers enhances the performance of GPU-based conic solvers, surpassing their CPU-based counterparts across a wide range of conic optimization problems. We also show that employing mixed-precision linear system solvers can potentially achieve additional acceleration without compromising solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies for insurers with random risk aversion under Heston's SV model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs expected certainty equivalents to explore the reinsurance and investment issue pertaining to an insurer that aims to maximize the expected utility while being subject to random risk aversion. The insurer's surplus process is modeled approximately by a drifted Brownian motion, and the financial market is comprised of a risk-free asset and a risky asset with its price depicted by Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. Within a game theory framework, a strict verification theorem is formulated to delineate the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies as well as the corresponding value function. Furthermore, through solving the pseudo Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, semi-analytical formulations for the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies and the associated value function are obtained under the exponential utility. Additionally, several numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of a recently introduced multistage stochastic integer model designed for optimizing the deployment of charging stations under uncertainty. A key contribution of this work is incorporating additional constraints accounting for congestion management at charging stations. The solution approach combines a greedy heuristic with a branch-and-price algorithm, enabling the efficient handling of medium instances. In the branch-and-price algorithm, when the solution to the restricted master problem is not integer, a greedy heuristic and a local search procedure are conducted to obtain feasible solutions. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Fault Detection Trade-off Design with Prior Fault Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of fault detection algorithms against uncertainty is crucial in the real-world industrial environment. Recently, a new probabilistic design scheme called distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) has emerged and received immense interest. Despite its robustness against unknown distributions in practice, current DRFD focuses on the overall detectability of all possible faults rather than the detectability of critical faults that are a priori known. Henceforth, a new DRFD trade-off design scheme is put forward in this work by utilizing prior fault information. The key contribution includes a novel distributional robustness metric of detecting a known fault and a new soft distributionally robust chance constraint that ensures robust detectability. Then a new trade-off design scheme of fault detection under unknown probability distributions is proposed, and this offers a flexible balance between the robustness of detecting known critical faults and the overall detectability against all possible faults. To solve the resulting problem, an exact reformulation is derived and a customized solution algorithm is developed, which includes a sequential optimization procedure and an initialization strategy. Finally, case studies on a simulated three-tank system and a real-world battery cell are carried out to showcase the usefulness of our DRFD method.</description>

      <title>Beyond IID: data-driven decision-making in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, e.g., due to the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot "correct" for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims at analyzing the performance of central data-driven policies but also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments and understanding key drivers of performance. We establish a first result which allows to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by Sample Average Approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate through several widely-studied problems -- e.g., newsvendor, pricing -- how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate-optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results towards a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial offers a quick hands-on introduction to solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems on currently available quantum computers. We cover both IBM and D-Wave machines: IBM utilizes a gate/circuit architecture, and D-Wave is a quantum annealer. We provide examples of three canonical problems and two models from practical applications. An associated GitHub repository provides the implementations in five companion notebooks. In addition to undergraduate and graduate students in computationally intensive disciplines, this article aims to reach working industry professionals seeking to explore the potential of near-term quantum applications.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Algorithm for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization under Unbounded Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g., Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient). To address this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms baselines in bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>Distributed Thompson sampling under constrained communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</description>

      <title>Distributed Facility Location Games with Candidate Locations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed facility location games with candidate locations, where agents on a line are partitioned into groups. Both desirable and obnoxious facility location settings are discussed. In distributed location problems, distortion can serve as a standard for quantifying performance, measuring the degree of difference between the actual location plan and the ideal location plan. For the desirable setting, under the max of sum cost objective, we give a strategyproof distributed mechanism with $5$-distortion, and prove that no strategyproof mechanism can have a distortion better than $\sqrt{2}+1$. Under the sum of max cost objective, we give a strategyproof distributed mechanism with $5$-distortion, and prove that no strategyproof mechanism can have a distortion better than $\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$. Under the max of max cost, we get a strategyproof distributed mechanism with $3$-distortion, and prove that no strategyproof mechanism can have a distortion better than $\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$. For the obnoxious setting, under three social objectives, we present that there is no strategyproof mechanism with bounded distortion in the case of discrete candidate locations, and no group strategyproof mechanism with bounded distortion in the case of continuous candidate locations.</description>

Abstract: A measure representation result for a functional modelling optimal design problems for plastic deformations, under linear growth conditions, is obtained.
  Departing from an energy with a bulk term depending on the deformation gradient and its derivatives, as well as a perimeter term, the functional in question corresponds to the relaxation of this energy with respect to a pair $(\chi,u)$, where $\chi$ is the characteristic function of a set of finite perimeter and $u$ is a function of bounded hessian.</description>
