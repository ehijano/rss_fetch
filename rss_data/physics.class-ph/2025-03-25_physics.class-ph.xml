      <title>Challenging the Law of Energy Conservation Through Superposed Waves Based on Spatial Symmetry of Two RF Sources: Theoretical Derivation and Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is grounded in the concept of spatial symmetry, which allows two co-phase RF sources to jointly radiate harmonic electromagnetic (EM) waves, even in presence of electromagnetic couplings between them. The superposition law is directly applied to the two waves owing to their sources, including the EM coupling effects. Our research uncovers a conflict with energy conservation law at the following two levels: (1) the total radiative powers as defined by Poynting theorem, and (2) further, the input powers of the sources. To explore this phenomenon, we create a symmetric dipole model to examine the energy behaviors at the sources and the superposed waves, separately. Both of the results reveal that the energy-doubling phenomenon presents when the dipoles are placed in close proximity. As the distance between the two dipoles increases, it is found that the total radiative power fluctuates in a damped manner and ultimately converges to a value required by energy conservation law. The theoretical conclusion of energy doubling is validated by experimental observations, which show a 1.59-fold increase in power within a microwave anechoic chamber. By analyzing the interactions, i.e., the EM coupling, between the two sources, we characterize a complete phenomenon of energy non-conservation.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry in Causality Constraints for Enhanced Acoustic Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized causality constraint for acoustic reflection and transmission for a flat slab with finite thickness, via the duality transformation. It is known that achieving the upper limit of the causality constraint necessitates a critical coupling condition to optimize absorption bandwidth within a specified material thickness. However, the importance of duality symmetry has been overlooked in this context. Our analytical model demonstrates that optimal absorption in a 2-port setup not only relies on the well-established critical coupling but also requires duality symmetry, defined as the invariance under duality transformation. To verify our theoretical prediction, we have experimentally realized customized metamaterials that exhibit quasi-duality symmetry. This was achieved by inducing global degeneracy between the first-order monopole and dipole resonances, consequently realizing an exceptionally large sound absorption capacity as permitted by the proposed causality constraint. Our findings elucidate the intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality, and they facilitate the exploitation of the untapped potential in existing passive absorbers for wave transport control.</description>

      <title>Material instability and subsequent restabilization from homogenization of periodic elastic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>
