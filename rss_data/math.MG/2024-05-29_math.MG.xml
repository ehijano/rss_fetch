      <title>Graph Skeletons and Diminishing Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define coarse skeletons of graphs in terms of two constants. We introduce the notion of coarse bottlenecking in graphs and show how it can guarantee that a skeleton resembles (up to quasi-isometry) the original graph. We show how notions similar to the coarse skeleton have been previously used to classify some coarse families of graphs. We explore the properties of a coarse skeleton and of combinations of skeletons. We show how these tools can be used to simplify the structure of graphs that have an excluded asymptotic minor, reducing it to a skeleton of the original containing at most a 3-fat minor, we give an example to show that a similar result does not hold for 2-fat minors.</description>

      <title>The Legendre Transform of Convex Lattice Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study convex lattice sets by the discrete Legendre transform. The definition of the polar of convex lattice sets in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is provided. It is worth mentioning that the polar of convex lattice sets have the self-dual property similar to that of convex bodies. Some properties of convex lattice sets are established, for instance, the inclusion relation, the union and intersection on the polar of convex lattice sets. In addition, we discuss the relationship between the cross-polytope and the discrete Mahler product. It states that a convex lattice set is the cross-polytope if and only if its discrete Mahler product is the smallest.</description>

      <title>Three quantitative versions of the P\'al inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P\'al inequality is a classical result which asserts that among all planar convex sets of given width the equilateral triangle is the one of minimal area. In this paper we prove three quantitative versions of this inequality, by quantifying how the closeness of the area of a convex set, of certain width, to the minimal value implies its closeness to the equilateral triangle. As a by-product, we also present a novel result concerning a quantitative inequality for the inradius of a set, under minimal width constraint.</description>

      <title>Large disks touching three sides of a quadrilateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every Jordan quadrilateral $Q\subset\mathbb{C}$ contains a disk $D$ so that $\partial D\cap\partial Q$ contains points of three different sides of $Q$. As a consequence, together with some modulus estimates from Lehto and Virtanen, we offer a short proof of the main result obtained by Chrontsios-Garitsis and Hinkkanen in 2024 and it also improves the bounds on their result.</description>

      <title>Triangle Tiling V: Tilings by a tile with integer sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2228</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.2228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An N-tiling of triangle ABC by triangle T is a way of writing ABC as a union of N triangles congruent to T, overlapping only at their boundaries. The triangle T is the "tile". The tile may or may not be similar to ABC. We wish to understand possible tilings by completely characterizing the triples (ABC, T, N) such that ABC can be N-tiled by T. In particular, this understanding should enable us to specify for which N there exists a tile T and a triangle ABC that is N-tiled by T; or given N, to determine which tiles and triangles can be used for N-tilings; or given ABC, to determine which tiles and N can be used to N-tile ABC. This is the fifth paper in a series of papers on this subject. The previous papers have reduced the problem the case when T has a 120 degree angle and integer side lengths. That is the problem we take up in this paper. We are still not able to completely solve the problem, but we prove that if there are any N-tilings by such tiles, then N is at least 96. Combining this results with our earlier work, we can remove the exception for a tile with a 120 degree angle, obtaining definitive non-existence results. For example, there is no 7-tiling, no 11-tiling, no 14-tiling, no 19-tiling, no 31-tiling, no 41-tiling, etc.
  Regarding the number N=96: There are several possible shapes of ABC, and for each shape, we exhibit the smallest N for which it is presently unknown whether there is an N-tiling. For example, for equilateral ABC, the simplest unsolved case as of May, 2012 is N=135. For each of these minimal-N examples, the tile would have to have sides (3,5,7).</description>

      <title>Average and Expected Distortion of Voronoi Paths and Scapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximation of a circle with the edges of a fine square grid distorts the perimeter by a factor about $\tfrac{4}{\pi}$. We prove that this factor is the same on average (in the ergodic sense) for approximations of any rectifiable curve by the edges of any non-exotic Delaunay mosaic (known as Voronoi path), and extend the results to all dimensions, generalizing Voronoi paths to Voronoi scapes.</description>

      <title>An estimate of the centroid Banach-Mazur distance between planar convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the variant of the Banach-Mazur distance $\delta_{BM}^{\rm cen} (C, D)$ of two convex bodies $C, D$ of $E^d$ with the additional requirement that the centroids of them coincide. We prove that $\delta_{BM}^{\rm cen} (C, D) \leq \frac{69}{17}$ for every $C, D$ of $E^2$.</description>

      <title>Sliced optimal transport: is it a suitable replacement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of metrics on the space of Borel probability measures on Euclidean space with finite $p$th moment for $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, called the $\textit{sliced Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$, which include the sliced Wasserstein and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics. We then show that these are complete, separable metric spaces that are topologically equivalent to the classical Monge--Kantorovich metrics and these metrics have a dual representation. However, we also prove these sliced metrics are $\textit{not}$ bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the classical ones in most cases, and also the spaces are (except for an endpoint case) $\textit{not}$ geodesic. The completeness, duality, and non-geodesicness are new even in the sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein cases, and non bi-Lipschitz equivalence is only known for a few specific cases. In particular this indicates that sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics are not suitable direct replacements for the classical Monge--Kantorovich metrics in problems where the specific metric or geodesic structure are critical.</description>

      <title>A matroid polytope approach to sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities for volume decomposition functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities for volume decomposition functionals $X_{2}$ and $X_{3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are established. To fulfil this task, we prove the recursion formulas for volume decomposition functionals and find out the connection between the domains of these functionals and matroid polytopes. Applications of matroid theory to convex geometry are presented.</description>

      <title>The worst approximable rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify and enumerate all rational numbers with approximation constant at least $\frac{1}{3}$ using hyperbolic geometry. Rational numbers correspond to geodesics in the modular torus with both ends in the cusp, and the approximation constant measures how far they stay out of the cusp neighborhood in between. Compared to the original approach, the geometric point of view eliminates the need to discuss the intricate symbolic dynamics of continued fraction representations, and it clarifies the distinction between the two types of worst approximable rationals: (1) There is a plane forest of Markov fractions whose denominators are Markov numbers. They correspond to simple geodesics in the modular torus with both ends in the cusp. (2) For each Markov fraction, there are two infinite sequences of companions, which correspond to non-simple geodesics with both ends in the cusp that do not intersect a pair of disjoint simple geodesics, one with both ends in the cusp and one closed.</description>
