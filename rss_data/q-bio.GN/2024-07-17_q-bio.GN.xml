      <title>OmniGenome: Aligning RNA Sequences with Secondary Structures in Genomic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structures of RNA sequences play a vital role in various cellular processes, while existing genomic foundation models (FMs) have struggled with precise sequence-structure alignment, due to the complexity of exponential combinations of nucleotide bases. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, a foundation model that addresses this critical challenge of sequence-structure alignment in RNA FMs. OmniGenome bridges the sequences with secondary structures using structure-contextualized modeling, enabling hard in-silico genomic tasks that existing FMs cannot handle, e.g., RNA design tasks. The results on two comprehensive genomic benchmarks show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex RNA subtasks. For example, OmniGenome solved 74% of complex puzzles, compared to SpliceBERT which solved only 3% of the puzzles. Besides, OmniGenome solves most of the puzzles within $1$ hour, while the existing methods usually allocate $24$ hours for each puzzle. Overall, OmniGenome establishes wide genomic application cases and offers profound insights into biological mechanisms from the perspective of sequence-structure alignment.</description>

      <title>Genomic Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are having transformative impacts across a wide range of scientific fields, particularly in the biomedical sciences. Just as the goal of Natural Language Processing is to understand sequences of words, a major objective in biology is to understand biological sequences. Genomic Language Models (gLMs), which are LLMs trained on DNA sequences, have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of genomes and how DNA elements at various scales interact to give rise to complex functions. In this review, we showcase this potential by highlighting key applications of gLMs, including fitness prediction, sequence design, and transfer learning. Despite notable recent progress, however, developing effective and efficient gLMs presents numerous challenges, especially for species with large, complex genomes. We discuss major considerations for developing and evaluating gLMs.</description>

      <title>SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler for rapid estimation of mutational histories of unusual lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 usually evolves at a relatively constant rate over time. Occasionally, however, lineages arise with higher-than-expected numbers of mutations given the date of sampling. Such lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, including selection pressures imposed by evolution during a chronic infection or exposure to mutation-inducing drugs like molnupiravir. We have developed an open-source web-based application (SMDP: SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Distribution Profiler) that compares a list of user-submitted lineage-defining mutations with established mutation distributions including those observed during (1) the first nine months of the pandemic, (2) during the global transmission of Omicron, (3) during the chronic infection of immunocompromised patients, and (4) during zoonotic spillover from humans to deer. The application calculates the most likely distribution for the user's mutation list and displays log likelihoods for all distributions. In addition, the transition:transversion ratio of the user's list is calculated to determine whether there is evidence of exposure to a mutation-inducing drug such as molnupiravir and indicates whether the list contains mutations in the proofreading domain of nsp14 which could lead to a higher-than-expected mutation rate in the lineage. This tool will be useful for public health and researchers seeking to rapidly infer evolutionary histories of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which can aid risk assessment and public health responses.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-Modal and Multi-Attribute Single-Cell Counts with CFGen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data has shown invaluable potential in community-driven tasks such as trajectory inference, batch effect removal and gene expression generation. However, most recent deep models generating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, ignoring the inherently discrete and over-dispersed nature of single-cell data, which limits downstream applications and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Moreover, crucial aspects of deep-learning-based synthetic single-cell generation remain underexplored, such as controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation and its role in the performance enhancement of downstream tasks. This work presents Cell Flow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model for multi-modal single-cell counts, which explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of the data. Our results suggest improved recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while accounting for novel generative tasks such as conditioning on multiple attributes and boosting rare cell type classification via data augmentation. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.</description>
