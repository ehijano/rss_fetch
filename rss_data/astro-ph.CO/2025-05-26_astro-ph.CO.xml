      <title>The Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter bispectrum as a probe of reionization morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have now been discovered out to redshift $z=13$, and are valuable probes of the reionization history at redshifts beyond the reach of other currently available tracers. Most inferences of the neutral hydrogen fraction from LAE observations rely on one-point and two-point statistics like the luminosity function and the power spectrum. We present here an analysis of the bispectrum of high-redshift LAEs and demonstrate its sensitivity to the Epoch of Reionization. We use the Sherwood-Relics suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE to generate realistic LAE mock catalogues for a wide range of reionization models, varying the ionization history and the source populations, including contributions of AGN to hydrogen reionization. We demonstrate that the bispectrum provides greater sensitivity than the power spectrum to both the timing and spatial morphology of reionization. Using reduced-$\chi^2$ analysis we further show that the bispectrum also responds more strongly to variations in source population and AGN contribution, apparently more efficiently capturing morphological features missed by two-point statistics. The redshift evolution of the bispectrum reflects the increased clustering of ionizing sources at earlier epochs. The sensitivity of the bispectrum to peculiar velocities underscores the importance of velocity corrections in comparisons to observations. Our findings demonstrate that the LAE bispectrum is a powerful higher-order statistic for probing reionization through current and future LAE surveys using telescopes such as Subaru and JWST.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Cosmic History with Machine Learning: A Study Using CART, MLPR, and SVR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reconstruct cosmic history via supervised learning through three methods: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). For this purpose, we use ages of simulated galaxies based on 32 massive, early-time, passively evolving galaxies in the range $0.12 &lt; z &lt; 1.85$, with absolute ages determined. Using this sample, we simulate subsamples of 100, 1000, 2000, 3334, 6680 points, through the Monte Carlo Method and adopting a Gaussian distribution centering on a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM as a fiducial model. We found that the SVR method demonstrates the best performance during the process. The methods MLPR and CART also present satisfactory performance, but their mean square errors are greater than those found for the SVR. Using the reconstructed ages, we estimate the matter density parameter and equation of state (EoS) and our analysis found the SVR with 600 predict points obtains $\Omega_m=0.329\pm{}^{0.010}_{0.010}$ and the dark energy EoS parameter $\omega= -1.054\pm{}^{0.087}_{0.126}$, which are consistent with the values from the literature. We highlight that we found the most consistent results for the subsample with 2000 points, which returns 600 predicted points and has the best performance, considering its small sample size and high accuracy. We present the reconstructed curves of galaxy ages and the best fits cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>A Joint Analysis of Strong Lensing and Type Ia Supernovae to Determine the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological model-independent determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining time-delay measurements from seven TDCOSMO systems, Einstein radius measurements, and Type Ia Supernovae data sourced from the Pantheon+ sample. For each lens of time-delay system, we calculate the angular diameter distance $D_{A_l}$ using the product $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l) \cdot D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l, z_s)$, where $D^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l)$ is reconstructed via Gaussian Processes from 99 Einstein radius measurements, and $D_{A,\Delta t}^{\textrm{Obs}}(z_l,z_s)$ is the time-delay angular distance. We also reconstruct the unanchored luminosity distance $H_0 D_L(z_l)$ from supernova data. By using the cosmic distance duality relation validity, we anchor $D_{A_l}$ and $H_0 D_L(z_l)$ to infer $H_0 = 70.55 \pm 7.44$ km/s/Mpc (68\% CL). Our result, though not resolving the Hubble tension, offers a cosmological model-independent consistency check and highlights the potential of using strong lensing and supernovae data via the cosmic distance duality relation to constrain $H_0$.</description>

      <title>The phase-space of tailed radio galaxies in massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio jets of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters are often bent due to the ram pressure of the intracluster medium. In this paper we start with a well-defined sample of galaxy clusters and subsequently identifying tailed radio sources in these known environments. Our sample consists of 81 galaxy clusters from the Planck ESZ cluster sample. We present a catalogue of 127 extended cluster radio sources, including brightest cluster galaxies, obtained by visually inspecting Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (1-2 GHz) observations. We have determined the bending angle of 109 well-structured sources, and classified them accordingly: 84 narrow-angle tailed sources (NATs), 16 wide-angle tailed sources (WATs), and 9 non-bent radio sources. We find a negative correlation between the bending angle and the distance to the cluster centre (impact radius), and we observe that NATs generally have smaller impact radii than the regular galaxy population and WATs. We present a phase-space diagram of tailed radio galaxy velocities and impact radii and find that NATs have a significant excess in the high-velocity and low-impact radius region of phase space, indicating they undergo the largest amount of ram pressure bending. We compared the results from our sample with those for jellyfish galaxies, and suggest that the mechanism responsible for bending the radio tails is similar to the stripping of gas in jellyfish galaxies, although tailed radio galaxies are more concentrated in the centre of the phase space. Finally, we find that NATs and WATs have the same occurrence ratio in merging and relaxed clusters. However, their distribution in the phase-space is significantly different. We report an excess of NATs in the high-velocity and low-impact-radius phase-space region in merging clusters, and an excess of relaxed clusters in the low-velocity and low-impact-radius region.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang &amp; Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$ is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$.
  Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Are single-field models of inflation and PBH production ruled out by ACT observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) imposes stronger constraints on primordial black hole (PBH) formation in single-field inflation models than the Planck data. In particular, the updated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements favor a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, a positive running $\alpha_s$, and a smaller slow-roll parameter $\eta$. Even in the absence of PBH production, the updated constraints together place many single-field models under tension with the CMB data. To explore this tension, we study PBH formation in an $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We investigate an impact of bending of the inflaton potential plateau toward reconciling the model with the new bounds for CMB observables. We find that attempts to increase $n_s$ by upward bending lead to negative values of $\alpha_s$ that are disfavored by the new bounds. A possible model-building approach to resolve the tension is proposed.</description>

      <title>The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field I: The deepest Herschel image of the submillimetre Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the image maps, data reduction, analysis and the first source counts from the Herschel SPIRE Dark Field. The SPIRE Dark Field is an area of sky near the North Ecliptic Pole observed many times during the calibration phase of the Herschel mission in order to characterise the stability of the SPIRE instrument and is subsequently one of the deepest imaged fields of the Universe at far-infrared-submillimetre wavelengths. The SPIRE dark field is concurrent with the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field used for a similar purpose. The final Dark Field map is comprised of 141 individual SPIRE observations in Small Map and Large Map modes defined by a deep inner region approximately 12' in diameter and a slightly shallower surrounding area of diameter ~30'. The depth of both regions reach well below the confusion limit of the SPIRE instrument at 250 microns, 350 microns and 500 microns. Two independent processes are used to extract sources, a standard map based method using the SUSSEXtractor algorithm and a list driven photometry approach using the XID algorithm with the Spitzer MIPS 24 microns catalogue as an input prior. The resulting source counts detect the turnover in the galaxy population with both methods shown to be consistent with previous results from other Herschel surveys, with the XID process reaching approximately twice as deep compared to traditional map based algorithms. Finally, we compare our results with two contemporary galaxy evolution models, again showing a good general agreement with the modelled counts.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes through preheating instabilities in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational wave production at strong first order phase transitions, with large-scale, long-running simulations of a system with a scalar order parameter and a relativistic fluid. One transition proceeds by detonations with asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.92$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.67$, and the other by deflagrations, with a nominal asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.44$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.5$. We investigate in detail the power spectra of velocity and shear stress and - for the first time in a phase transition simulation - their time decorrelation, which is essential for the understanding of gravitational wave production. In the detonation, the decorrelation speed is larger than the sound speed over a wide range of wavenumbers in the inertial range, supporting a visual impression of a flow dominated by supersonic shocks. Vortical modes do not contribute greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases, we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the flow. The gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. For both cases this is approximately $\tilde{\Omega}^\infty_\text{gw} \simeq 0.017$, even though they have quite different kinetic energy densities. The corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, for flows which decay in much less than a Hubble time, is $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(4.8\pm1.1)\times 10^{-8}$ for the detonation, and $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(1.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-8}$ for the deflagration.</description>

      <title>First astrometric constraints on parity-violation in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of stellar positions and velocities, offers a promising approach to probing the low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Notably, astrometric vector sky maps are sensitive to parity-violating SGWB signals, which cannot be distinguished using pulsar timing array observations in an isotropic SGWB. We present the first astrometric constraints on parity-violating SGWB using quasar catalogs from Gaia DR3 and VLBA data. By analyzing the $EB$ correlation in the two-point correlation function of the proper motions of the quasars, we find 2$\sigma$ constraints on the parity-violating SGWB amplitude $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.020 \pm 0.025$ from Gaia DR3 and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{V} = -0.004 \pm 0.010$ from VLBA. These constraints are valid in the frequency range $4.2 \times 10^{-18}\,{\rm Hz} &lt; f &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{-8}\,{\rm Hz}$. Although not currently a tight constraint on theoretical models, this first attempt lays the groundwork for future investigations using more precise astrometric data.</description>

      <title>Classifying globular clusters and applying them to estimate the mass of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12336v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex situ (via accretion). We find that $45.3\%$ have formed in situ, $38.4\%$ may be related to known merger events: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the Helmi streams, the Sequoia galaxy, and the Kraken galaxy. We also further identify three new sub-structures associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The remaining $16.3\%$ of GCs are unrelated to the known mergers and thought to be from small accretion events. We select 46 GCs which have radii $8.0&lt;r&lt;37.3$ kpc and obtain the anisotropy parameter $\beta=0.315_{-0.049}^{+0.055}$, which is lower than the recent result using the sample of GCs in Gaia Data Release 2, but still in agreement with it by considering the error bar. By using the same sample, we obtain the MW mass inside the outermost GC as $M(&lt;37.3 kpc)=0.423_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding $M_{200}=1.11_{-0.18}^{+0.25}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$. The estimated mass is consistent with the results in many recent studies. We also find that the estimated $\beta$ and mass depend on the selected sample of GCs. However, it is difficult to determine whether a GC fully traces the potential of the MW.</description>

      <title>Luminosity function of Type II GRBs:differences from long GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally categorized into long and short bursts based on their duration ($T_{90}$). Recently, it has been proposed that GRBs can also be classified into type I (merger) and type II (collapsar) bursts based on the different origin. From a sample of \textit{Swift} long GRBs~(LGRBs) with a redshift completeness of 60\% and $P \geq 2.6 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, collected through the end of 2023, we identify a pure sample of 146 Type II GRBs. With this sample, we construct the luminosity function (LF) using both the Broken Power Law (BPL) and Triple Power Law (TPL) models. Our results indicate that, similar to LGRBs, a strong redshift evolution in either luminosity or density is necessary to accurately account for the observations, regardless of the specific form of the LF assumed. The LF of LGRBs remains a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting it follows a BPL form, while others advocate for a TPL form. In our study, we find that the LF of Type II GRBs tends to favor a BPL model.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early Universe Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Density Profile Around a Newborn First Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves undergo redshift as they propagate through the expanding universe, and the redshift may exhibit time-dependent drift. Consequently, for any isolated gravitational wave sources, the mass parameter $\mathcal{M}$ and the redshift $z$ exhibit an observational degeneracy, typically manifesting in the waveform as the redshifted mass $\mathcal{M}(1+z)$. Matching together the wave propagation and the wave generation solutions, we show that dimensionless source parameters depending on mass $\mathcal{M}$ can break this degeneracy. Notably, the postmerger signal from binary neutron stars contains several dimensionless parameters that satisfy this condition, including the quality factors of different frequency components and their frequency ratios. Considering the observations of solely the postmerger signal by the Neutron star Extreme Matter Observatory or the Einstein Telescope, based on the Fisher analysis, we find that the redshift can be measured with fractional uncertainties of $\sim30\%$ for sources at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.09$. Additionally, we present a corrected derivation of the waveform phase correction due to the redshift drift effect, rectifying a sign error in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During inflation, higher derivative terms in the gravitational action may play a significant role. Building on new stable formulations of four-derivative scalar-tensor theories, we study the impact of these corrections in the case where the inflaton is also the additional scalar degree of freedom of the modified theory. This case is highly restricted by requiring that in the homogeneous limit inflation must still work, and that the initial data must be in the weak coupling limit to respect the validity of the effective theory. In such cases, the non-linear dynamics of large perturbations are very similar to the GR case, with the main deviations captured by the terms relating to the homogeneous Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet contributions. We show that in principle it is possible to dynamically drive the field out of the weak-coupling regime from a starting point well within it, but that to do so one has to finely tune the setup, so such cases are unlikely to occur generically. This work provides a basis for the study of less restricted models in future, for example those in which the inflaton and scalar degree of freedom are independent, or in which one is not restricted to a weakly coupled regime.</description>

Abstract: According to CMB measurements, baryonic matter constitutes about $5\%$ of the mass-energy density of the universe. A significant population of these baryons, for a long time referred to as `missing', resides in a low density, warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) outside galaxy clusters, tracing the ``cosmic web'', a network of large scale dark matter filaments. Various studies have detected this inter-cluster gas, both by stacking and by observing individual filaments in compact, massive systems. In this paper, we study short filaments (&lt; 10 Mpc) connecting massive clusters ($M_{500} \approx 3\times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) using the scattering of CMB light off the ionised gas, a phenomenon known as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. The first part of this work is a search for suitable candidates for high resolution follow-up tSZ observations. We identify four cluster pairs with an intercluster signal above the noise floor (S/N $&gt;$ 2), including two with a tentative $&gt;2\sigma$ statistical significance for an intercluster bridge from the ACT data alone. In the second part of this work, starting from the same cluster sample, we directly stack on ${\sim}100$ cluster pairs and observe an excess SZ signal between the stacked clusters of $y=(7.2^{+2.3}_{-2.5})\times 10^{-7}$ with a significance of $3.3\sigma$. It is the first tSZ measurement of hot gas between clusters in this range of masses at moderate redshift ($\langle z\rangle\approx 0.5$). We compare this to the signal from simulated cluster pairs with similar redshifts and separations in the THE300 and MAGNETICUM Pathfinder cosmological simulations and find broad consistency. Additionally, we show that our measurement is consistent with scaling relations between filament parameters and mass of the embedded halos identified in simulations.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>Introducing a multiscale feature integration network for inpainting with applications to enhanced CMB map reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network, SkyReconNet, which combines the expanded receptive fields of dilated convolutional layers along with standard convolutions, to capture both the global and local features for reconstructing the missing information in an image. We implement our network to inpaint the masked regions in a full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. The hybrid design of SkyReconNet leverages the strengths of standard and dilated convolutions to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions, by effectively utilizing the information from surrounding unmasked areas. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the missing CMB fluctuations, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. The network's generic architecture enables application to other physics-based challenges involving data with missing or defective pixels, systematic artefacts etc. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool not only for CMB analyses but also for image-based experiments across disciplines where such data imperfections are prevalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chern-Simons gravitational term is typically coupled to the inflaton field during inflation. However, this setup leads to ghost instabilities in the tensor sector, which severely constrain observable signatures of parity violation in cosmological correlators. In this work, we explore an alternative scenario where the Chern-Simons term is minimally coupled to an isocurvature field, $\sigma$, within a multi-field inflationary framework. Notably, this configuration leaves the quadratic action for tensor perturbations unaffected, thereby avoiding ghost instabilities. We analyze the resulting phenomenology and show that the model allows for parity-violating signatures and distinctive features in the primordial scalar-tensor bispectra, while remaining theoretically consistent and observationally viable.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of primordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level of the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT predictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the EFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial oscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the well-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation processes. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy power spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to derive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work highlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios on scales that complement CMB observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models, of thawing type, and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytic expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$ in terms of matter evolution; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Using finally the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytic bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>
