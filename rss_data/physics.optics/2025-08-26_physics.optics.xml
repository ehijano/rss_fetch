      <title>Features of Surface Structuring of Direct and Indirect Band Gap Semiconductors by Femtosecond Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of femtosecond (fs) laser radiation on semiconductors with direct (ZnSe, GaAs, CdZnTe) band gap, with the structurally induced direct-to-indirect band gap transition (PbI2, GaSe) and indirect band gap (Si) has been studied. The fs-laser treatment of semiconductors has been performed in the multi-pulse regime in air environment. The influence of fs-laser radiation parameters on surface morphology of the semiconductors has been analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2D Fourier transform of SEM images, optical photoluminescence spectroscopy. Under the treatment with the fundamental fs-laser radiation (800 nm, about 130-150 fs) both low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS have been observed. Specific features of LIPSS of two types (low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS) and other structure peculiarities (grooves, grains, different defects in periodic structure, i.e. loops, strip breaks, and ablation products) have been also analysed. The formation mechanisms of LIPSS are also considered within the scope of two approaches,namely an electromagnetic approach and matter reorganization processes.</description>

      <title>Optics for broadband x-ray ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional x-ray ptychography, diffraction data is collected by scanning a sample through a monochromatic, and spatially coherent, x-ray beam. A high-resolution image is then retrieved using an iterative algorithm. Combined with a scan of the incident photon energy, it is also possible to access chemical and elemental information. Although powerful, the high brilliance required currently constrains the method to 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron sources and long scanning times. An alternative approach is to use a broadband illumination in combination with an energy resolving detector. These detectors record the data in a series of energy channels simultaneously, creating a stack of coherent data suitable for a ptychographic reconstruction. This approach promises to unlock the full power of the radiation source and provide spectral imaging at a higher rate and in a single acquisition. However, these detectors currently saturate well below reaching the flux rates produced at synchrotrons, which is preventing the uptake of this approach. Furthermore, current monochromatic synchrotron setups typically employ Fresnel zone plates for pre-sample focusing due to their stability, flexibility, and affordability, but these diffractive optics limit the spectral bandwidth that the setup can accept. In this article, we analyze the problem and consider alternative optics that can both maximize the total photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth. Broadband x-ray ptychography has the potential to dramatically reduce data collection times at synchrotron sources, but also to harness the full power of lower brilliance sources and transition x-ray ptychography into a laboratory technique.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the symplectic group Sp(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive and discuss the properties of the symplectic group Sp(2), which arises in Hamiltonian dynamics and ray optics. We show that a symplectic matrix can be written as the product of a symmetric dilation matrix and a rotation matrix, in either order. A symplectic matrix can be written as the exponential of a generating matrix, and there is a one-to-one relation between the coefficients of the symplectic and generating matrices. We also discuss the adjoint and Schmidt decompositions of a symplectic matrix, and the product of two symplectic matrices. The results of this article have applications in many subfields of physics.</description>

      <title>Lorentz transformations in time and two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, matrix and vector formalisms for Lorentz transformations in time ($t$) and two space dimensions ($x$ and $y$) are developed and discussed. Lorentz transformations conserve the squared interval $t^2 - x^2 - y^2$. Examples of Lorentz transformations include boosts in arbitrary directions, which mix time ansd space, and rotations in space, which do not. Lorentz transformations can be described by matrices and coordinate vectors. Lorentz matrices comprise the special unitary group SO(1,2). The general form of a Lorentz matrix is derived, in terms of both components and block matrices. Each Lorentz matrix $L$ has the Schmidt decomposition $QDP^t$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix, and $P$ and $Q$ are orthogonal matrices. It also has the Schmidt-like decomposition $R_2BR_1^t$, where $B$ is a boost matrix, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are rotation matrices. Hence, a Lorentz matrix is specified by three parameters, namely the boost energy $\gamma$, and the rotation angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. Each Lorentz matrix has a pair of reciprocal Schmidt coefficients (which are real), and a unit coefficient, which is its own reciprocal. It also has a pair of reciprocal eigenvalues (which are real or complex), and a unit eigenvalue. The physical significances of the input and output Schmidt vectors, and the eigenvectors, are discussed. Every Lorentz matrix can be written as the exponential of a generating matrix. There are three basic generators, which produce boosts along the $x$ and $y$ axes, and a rotation about the $t$ axis (in the $xy$ plane). These generators satisfy certain commutation relations, which show that SO(1,2) is isomorphic to Sp(2) and SU(1,1). Simple formulas are derived for the energy and angle parameters of a composite transformation, in terms of the parameters of its constituent transformations.</description>

      <title>Exponentiation and decomposition formulas for common operators 1: Classical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial, exponentiation and factorization (decomposition) formulas are derived and discussed for common matrix operators that arise in studies of classical dynamics, linear and nonlinear optics, and special relativity. To understand the physical properties of systems of common interest, one first needs to understand the mathematical properties of the symplectic group Sp(2), the special unitary groups SU(2) and SU(1,1), and the special orthogonal groups SO(3) and SO(1,2). For these groups, every matrix can be written as the exponential of a generating matrix, which is a linear combination of three fundamental matrices (generators). For Sp(2), SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), every matrix also has a Schmidt decomposition, in which it is written as the product of three simpler matrices. The relations between the entries of the matrix, the generator coefficients and, where appropriate, the Schmidt-decomposition parameters are described in detail. It is shown that Sp(2) is isomorphic to (has the same structure as) SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), and SU(2) is isomorphic to SO(3). Several examples of these isomorphisms (relations between Schmidt decompositions and product rules) are described, which illustrate their usefulness (complicated results can be anticipated or derived easily). This tutorial is written at a level that is suitable for senior undergraduate students and junior graduate students.</description>

      <title>Performance Validation of Coded Wavefront Sensing for Quantitative Phase Imaging of Static and Dynamic Specimens Using Digital Holographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded wavefront sensing (Coded-WFS) is a snapshot quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique that has been shown to successfully leverage the memory effect to retrieve the phase of biological specimens. In this paper, we perform QPI on static silica beads and dynamic HEK cells using Coded-WFS. The accuracy of the retrieved phase map is validated using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for the same specimens. We report comparisons of simultaneous bright-field intensity and optical path delay.</description>

      <title>A Data-Aware Fourier Neural Operator for Modeling Spatiotemporal Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including Maxwell's equations in computational electromagnetics. Prior machine learning models often fail to capture both temporal field evolution and generalization to irregular geometries. Here, we introduce a Data-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (DA-FNO) as a surrogate solver. Applied autoregressively, it predicts the temporal evolution of all field components while monitoring energy dynamics, terminating automatically once energy converges. The model generalizes to complex geometries and the optical C-band without retraining, achieving a 7.5* speedup with nearly 92.5% accuracy. This approach offers a potentially efficient and accurate alternative to conventional iterative solvers for C-band photonic simulations.</description>

      <title>Femtojoule-per-operation photonic computer for the subset sum problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient computing is becoming increasingly important in the information era. However, electronic computers with von Neumann architecture can hardly meet the challenge due to the inevitable energy-intensive data movement, especially when tackling computationally hard problems or complicated tasks. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient photonic computer that solves intractable subset sum problem (SSP) by making use of the extremely low energy level of photons (~10^(-19) J) and a time-of-flight storage technique. We show that the energy consumption of the photonic computer maintains no larger than 10^(-15) J per operation at a reasonably large problem size N=33, and it consumes 10^(8) times less energy than the most energy-efficient supercomputer for a medium-scale problem. In addition, when the photonic computer is applied to deal with real-life problems that involves iterative computation of the SSP, the photonic advantage in energy consumption is further enhanced and massive energy can be saved. Our results indicate the superior competitiveness of the photonic computer in the energy costs of complex computation, opening a possible path to green computing.</description>

      <title>Wave Tracing: Generalizing The Path Integral To Wave Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the wave nature of light and the propagation and diffraction of electromagnetic fields is crucial for the accurate simulation of many phenomena, yet wave simulations are significantly more computationally complex than classical ray-based models. In this work, we start by analyzing the classical path integral formulation of light transport and rigorously study which wave-optical phenomena can be reproduced by it. We then introduce a bilinear path integral generalization for wave-optical light transport that models the wave interference between paths. This formulation subsumes many existing methods that rely on shooting-bouncing rays or UTD-based diffractions, and serves to give insight into the challenges of such approaches and the difficulty of sampling good paths in a bilinear setting.
  With this foundation, we develop a weakly-local path integral based on region-to-region transport using elliptical cones that allows sampling individual paths that still model wave effects accurately. As with the classic path integral form of the light transport equation, our path integral makes it possible to derive a variety of practical transport algorithms. We present a complete system for wave tracing with elliptical cones, with applications in light transport for rendering and efficient simulation of long-wavelength radiation propagation and diffraction in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Programmable k-local Ising Machines and all-optical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Photonic Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude. This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame (forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable, all-optical KAN processing.</description>

      <title>Design of broadband optical gain in GaSb-based waveguide amplifiers with asymmetric quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A design strategy for achieving broadband optical gain in GaSb-based semiconductor amplifiers operating beyond 2 \mu m is presented. By employing asymmetric GaInSb/AlGaAsSb quantum wells (QWs) of varying thicknesses, a flat and wide gain spectrum is demonstrated. The approach leverages carrier density and transition energy tuning across QWs to access various energy levels at specific current densities. Simulations using "Harold" self-consistent environment predict a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) gain bandwidth exceeding 340 nm for a structure comprising one 7 nm and three 13 nm-thick QWs. The modelling parameters were validated against experimental data, ensuring a robust framework for designing broadband amplifiers and superluminescent diodes for mid-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven Ultrafast and Highly Efficient Saturable Absorption for Ultrashort Pulse Generation Based on 2D V2C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmon-driven ultrafast nonlinearities hold promise for advanced photonics but remain challenging to harness in two-dimensional materials at telecommunication wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate few-layer V2C MXene as a high-performance saturable absorber by leveraging its tailored surface plasmon resonance. Combining transient absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we unveil a plasmon-driven relaxation mechanism dominated by interfacial high-energy hot electron generation (~100 fs), enabling giant ultrafast nonlinearities. Crucially, at the communication band (1550 nm), V2C exhibits a high saturable absorption coefficient of -1.35 cm/GW. Integrating this into an erbium-doped fiber laser, we generate mode-locked pulses with a duration of 486 fs at 1569 nm, a 39.51 MHz repetition rate, and exceptional stability (92 dB SNR). This work establishes plasmonic MXenes as a paradigm for tailored ultrafast photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent Optical and Polaritonic Properties of hBN-encapsulated Monolayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) support robust excitons in the visible to near-infrared spectral range. Their reduced dielectric screening results in large binding energies, and combined with a direct bandgap in monolayer form, these excitons dominate the optical response of TMDs. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the temperature-dependent optical and polaritonic properties of high-quality, flux-grown $\mathrm{WS_2}$, $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, $\mathrm{WSe_2}$, and $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayers, encapsulated by hBN, in the full temperature range between $5-300 \mathrm{K}$. Using reflection spectroscopy measurements, we evaluate and compare the optical and polaritonic constituents of the TMD excitons in terms of oscillator strength, linewidth and negative permittivity. We find that it is $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ that exhibits the most pronounced optical and polaritonic response, stemming from its rapid linewidth narrowing at low temperatures, as compared to the temperature-dependent response of the other TMDs. In addition, we find that all four TMDs exhibits a temperature-dependent negative real part permittivity, thus supporting surface-exciton-polaritons. We derive their dispersion relation, confinement factors and losses, similarly revealing that $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ exhibit enhanced polaritonic properties. These findings establish a comparative framework for understanding the optical and polaritonic properties of monolayer TMDs, with implications on their utilization in optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Electrically switchable photonic diode empowered by chiral resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-chip integration of nonreciprocal optical devices remains a critical challenge for modern optoelectronics, as conventional magneto-optic approaches suffer from material incompatibility and excessive optical losses. Nonlinear photonic diodes have emerged as a promising magnet-free alternative, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by inherent limitations in reconfigurability. Here, we present an all-silicon, electrically tunable photonic diode leveraging engineered chiral resonances in an ultra-compact microring architecture. The pronounced asymmetric modal coupling enables nonreciprocal transmission with two distinct operation modes at threshold powers down to -5 dBm. The chirality further enables unprecedented control over self-pulsation dynamics, manifesting in propagation-direction-dependent oscillation thresholds and temporal signatures. Crucially, post-fabrication electrical reconfigurability allows dynamic switching between forward, backward, and disabled states. This work represents a significant advancement in integrated nonreciprocal photonics, offering a CMOS-compatible solution with transformative potential for optical interconnects, photonic neural networks, and signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic interferences sampled by a diffraction grating generate moir{\'e} fringes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the formation of moir{\'e} patterns when observing the diffraction of surface plasmons by periodic gratings of finite extent with an imaging spectrometer that maps the light emission as a function of the wavelength and the propagation distance. This phenomenon results from the formation of standing waves upon the partial reflection of surface plasmons at the far end of the grating and their scattering by the periodic corrugations. The moir{\'e} fringes are created as a result of the incommensurability between the sampling pitch of the grating and the wavelengthdependent standing waves. We introduce a scalar model that supports these observations and provides physical insight into these results, including a method to estimate the complex Fresnel reflection coefficient of a surface plasmon at the edge of a grating.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transparency of photons in non-Markovian coupled waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of photons through a pair of coupled single-mode waveguides is studied in detail. It is assumed that one of the waveguides is coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir, described by a Lorentzian spectrum distribution. We identified four distinct regimes for the transmission coefficient and found that, in some conditions, it is more efficient to launch the photons in the lossy waveguide to achieve high transmission. We also report on a loss-induced transparency effect that is induced by the distribution of the frequencies present in the reservoir.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hyperspectral imaging with optical microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionised time and frequency metrology [1, 2]. The advent of microresonator-based frequency combs ('microcombs' [3-5]) is set to lead to the miniaturisation of devices that are ideally suited to a wide range of applications, including microwave generation [6, 7], ranging [8-10], the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs [11], neuromorphic computing [12, 13], high-bandwidth data communications[14], and quantum-optics [15, 16] platforms. Here, we introduce a new microcomb application for three-dimensional imaging. Our method can simultaneously determine the chemical identity and full three-dimensional geometry, including size, shape, depth, and spatial coordinates, of particulate matter ranging from micrometres to millimetres in size across nearly $10^5$ distinct image pixels. We demonstrate our technique using millimetre-sized plastic specimens (i.e. microplastics measuring less than 5 mm). We combine amplitude and phase analysis and achieve a throughput exceeding $1.2~10^6$ pixels per second with micrometre-scale precision. Our method leverages the defining feature of microcombs - their large line spacing - to enable precise spectral diagnostics using microcombs with a repetition frequency of 1 THz. Our results suggest scalable operation over several million pixels and nanometre-scale axial resolution. Coupled with its high-speed, label-free and multiplexed capabilities, our approach provides a promising basis for environmental sensing, particularly for the real-time detection and characterisation of microplastic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems [17].</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Theorem and Fundamental Transfer Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

      <title>Correlations in the Binding Energy of Triexcitons and Biexcitons in Single CdSe/CdS Nanoplatelets Revealed by Heralded Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets present reduced Auger recombination, giving rise to enhanced multiexciton emission. This virtue makes them good candidates to investigate higher-order carrier dynamics, allowing to extract important excitonic properties, such as biexciton and triexciton binding energies that highly influence applications involving high excitation fluxes. Here, we explore triexciton emission, emanating from single core/shell CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. We apply heralded post-selection of photon triplets using an advanced home-built single-photon spectrometer in order to resolve the triexciton$-$biexciton$-$exciton$-$ground state cascaded relaxation both in time and spectrum, and unambiguously determine the triexciton relaxation route and interaction nature. The results show a characteristic blue shift of the biexciton and triexciton, pointing to repulsive multiexciton interaction in the nanoplatelets under study. The relatively small measured energy shift of the triexciton (5.9 $\pm$ 0.7 meV) indicates that it recombines through the 1S bands rather than the 1P bands, in agreement with findings on other colloidal quantum dot systems. Most importantly, the strong correlation between the biexciton and triexciton binding energies, and the ability to tune them via control of the particle dimensions and composition, paves the way for developing emitters of nearly degenerate photon triplets.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Gaussian Wave Splatting for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS (GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements, collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>Probing the spectral width of the 12.4-keV solid-state $^{45}$Sc isomeric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wettability of monolayer and multilayer graphene remains a topic of longstanding debate. Here, we combined first-principles molecular dynamics simulations accelerated with the atomic cluster expansion machine learning interatomic potential to investigate how substrate, graphene layer number, and intercalated water molecules influence graphene's wettability. Simulated vibrational sum-frequency generation (vSFG) spectra revealed that the experimentally observed hydrophilic behavior of monolayer graphene on hydrophilic substrates arose not from wetting transparency, but from signal cancellation induced by intercalated water. Energetic analyses further showed that intercalated water molecules were thermodynamically favorable for monolayer graphene on hydrophilic substrates, but not for multilayer systems, leading to changes in the vSFG response in line with experimental observations. These results offer a mechanistic understanding of graphene-water interactions and have broad implications for the design of graphene-based interfaces and devices.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Index-Discontinuous Environments</title>

Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces have become a transformative platform for subwavelength optical devices, leveraging their high quality (Q)-factors, pronounced local field enhancement, and extensive long-range interactions. However, current high-Q SLR implementations are fundamentally limited by their dependence on homogeneous dielectric environments. This restriction significantly hinders their applicability in emerging fields such as molecular sensing, where operation in heterogeneous dielectric media (e.g., interfaces with an aqueous or air cladding) is often indispensable. To overcome this limitation, we introduce guided surface lattice resonances (gSLRs) by integrating nanoparticle arrays within slab waveguides. This configuration facilitates efficient coupling between scattered light and Bloch modes, thereby enabling high-Q multimodal resonances even in index-discontinuous environments. Experimental validation under incoherent illumination demonstrates a Q-factor of 1489 in an index-mismatched surrounding. Furthermore, the coupling strength and resonance intensity of these multimodal gSLRs can be continuously modulated by adjusting the vertical displacement of the nanoparticle arrays within the slab layers. To augment the sensitivity to local dielectric variations, we investigate gSLRs in metasurfaces integrated with metallic substrates, demonstrating suitability for biomolecule detection. A mathematical sensing model, incorporating biochemical reaction kinetics and optical responses, is established by representing adsorbed molecules as a uniform dielectric layer and validated through bovine serum albumin (BSA) sensing experiments. This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of resonance engineering in complex media but also facilitates the development of ultrathin, ultra-compact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling of pseudospectra in exponentially sensitive lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important features of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is the existence of a unique type of singularities, the so-called exceptional points (EPs). When the corresponding systems operate around such singularities, they exhibit ultrasensitive behavior that has no analog in conservative systems. An alternative way to realize such ultra-sensitivity relies on asymmetric couplings. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis based on pseudospectra, that shows the origin of exponential sensitivity, without relying on topological zero modes or the localization of all eigenstates (skin effect), but on the underlying extreme lattice non-normality. In particular, we consider four different types of lattices (Hatano-Nelson, Sylvester-Kac, non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and a non-Hermitian random lattice) and identify the conditions for exponential sensitivity as a function of the lattice size. Complex and structured pseudospectra reveal the signatures of exponential sensitivity both on the eigenvalue spectra and on the underlying dynamics. Our study, may open new directions on studies related to the exploitation of non-normality for constructing ultra-sensitive systems that do not rely on the existence of EPs.</description>

Abstract: Delayed luminescence (DL) is a quantized signal that is characteristic of photoexcited molecules entering a relaxed state. Studying DL provides critical insight into photophysical mechanisms through the analysis of specific spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity DL imaging system using a quantitative scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (qCMOS) camera and a single-photon counting resolution. By optimizing the optical architecture and signal processing algorithms together, we achieved full-field spatiotemporal DL imaging at megapixel resolution (i.e., $2304 \times 4096$ pixels). Key findings include the following: (1) we observed spatial heterogeneity in DL intensity across the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana, with stronger signals detected in veins and at sites of mechanical injury; (2) species-specific DL responses occur in response to oxidative stress, with Hydrocotyle vulgaris and Ginkgo biloba showing enhanced central DL activity; (3) excitation using white light induced maximum DL intensity, while red and blue light differentially modulated decay kinetics. Finally, we develop a two-level quantum model that links DL dynamics to the populations of excited-state electrons, thereby developing a theoretical framework for future photophysical research. Collectively, this work establishes a theoretical and technological framework for advancing plant phenotyping under stress conditions and optimizing light environments.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades the performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication and remote sensing systems by introducing phase and intensity distortions. While a majority of research focuses on mitigating these effects to ensure robust signal transmission, an underexplored alternative is to leverage the transformation of structured light to characterize the turbulent medium itself. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework that fuses post-propagation intensity speckle patterns and orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectral data for atmospheric turbulence parameter inference. Our architecture, based on a modified InceptionNet backbone, is optimized to extract and integrate multi-scale features from these distinct optical modalities. This multimodal approach achieves validation accuracies exceeding 80%, substantially outperforming conventional single-modality baselines. The framework demonstrates high inference accuracy and enhanced training stability across a broad range of simulated turbulent conditions, quantified by varying Fried parameters (r0) and Reynolds numbers (Re). This work presents a scalable and data-efficient method for turbulence characterization, offering a pathway toward robust environmental sensing and the optimization of dynamic FSO systems.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity electro-optic modulation for advanced pulse-comb synthesis</title>

Abstract: Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However, the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning. Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold enhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries. Our findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier, unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable electro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous optical selection rule for independent control of valley currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal an instantaneous optical valley selection rule that illuminates the coupling between the instantaneous optical chirality of the driving laser field and the chirality of valley systems. Building on this principle, we propose and demonstrate that a single chirality-separated optical field, in which oppositely signed instantaneous optical chiralities are separated within an optical cycle, enables independent manipulation of currents from K and K' valleys. Based on this scheme, we highlight two key example applications: (1) complete separation of currents from different valleys, yielding 100%-purity valley-polarized currents, and (2) generation of pure valley current with zero net charge flow. Our work offers a robust and highly controllable all-optical strategy for ultrafast engineering valley currents in the optical cycle timescale, paving a new avenue for valleytronics and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Photon-Trapping Spectrometer-on-a-Chip on Silicon Platform with Extended Near-Infrared Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Topologically Protected Polaritonic Bound State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as powerful tools for realizing ultra-high-Q resonances in nanophotonics. While previous implementations have primarily relied on dielectric metasurfaces, they remain limited by the diffraction limit. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate and experimentally validate the existence of topologically protected phonon-polaritonic BICs in periodic arrays of cylindrical nanoresonators composed of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN), which have the availability of two restrahlen bands (lower (type-I) and upper (type II)), operating in the lower Reststrahlen band (RB-1). Owing to the uniaxial anisotropy of hBN and the rotational symmetry of the structure, these systems support topologically symmetry-protected BICs at the {\Gamma}-point, where radiative losses are fully suppressed. The total quality factor is ultimately bounded by the intrinsic phonon damping of h11BN, enabling high-Q polaritonic modes with minimal radiation leakage. When cylindrical symmetry is broken via angular tilting of incident light away from the normal incidence, these BICs transition into quasi-BICs (q-BICs) with strong field confinement and tunable radiation leakage. This topological protection enables robust control over mode lifetimes and confinement, paving the way toward scalable polaritonic platforms for mid-infrared optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a result derived from the optical chirality continuity equation that shows the existence of a source term describing optical chirality generation through the interactions of the magnetic induction field with a source current, without contributions from the electric field. This framework is validated through a metasurface-based methodology. Using a lossless, all-dielectric nanoparticle array, we engineer an in-plane rotating electric field that generates out-of-plane optical magnetism. This array exhibits a far-field circular dichroism of 0.47 and a high-quality factor on the order of 10^6. The presented findings demonstrate the feasibility of inducing chiral optical responses from a magnetic source. This work establishes a new paradigm for structured photonic media, offering insights into the design of nanophotonic devices that exploit optical magnetism for chiral light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>
