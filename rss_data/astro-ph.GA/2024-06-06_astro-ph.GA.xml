      <title>First VLBI detection of Fornax A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies harbouring jetted active galactic nuclei are a frequent target of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) because they play an essential role in exploring how jets form and propagate. Hence, only few have not been detected with VLBI yet; Fornax A is one of the most famous examples. Here we present the first detection of the compact core region of Fornax A with VLBI. At 8.4 GHz the faint core is consistent with an unresolved point source. We constrained its flux density to be $S_0 = 47.5-62.3\,\textrm{mJy}$ and its diameter to be $D^\textrm{min}_0 \leq 70\,\mu\textrm{as}$. The high values of the measured brightness temperature ($T_\textrm{B} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\textrm{K}$) imply that the observed radiation is of non-thermal origin, likely associated with the synchrotron emission from the active galactic nucleus. We also investigated the possibility of a second radio source being present within the field of view. Adding a second Gaussian component to the geometrical model-fit does not significantly improve the quality of the fit and we, therefore, conclude that our detection corresponds to the compact core of Fornax A. Analysis of the non-trivial closure phases provides evidence for the detection of more extended flux density, on the angular scale of $\sim4000\,\mu\textrm{as}$. Finally, the fractional circular polarisation of the core is consistent with zero, with a conservative upper limit being $m_\textrm{circ} \leq 4\%$.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. This fact highlights the necessity for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the standard $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that the AGN feedback plays a crucial role in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>A comparison of pre-existing $\Lambda$CDM predictions with the abundance of JWST galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a high abundance of bright galaxies at redshift, $z\gtrsim 12$, which has been widely interpreted as conflicting with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In Cowley et al. (2018) predictions were made - prior to the JWST observations - for the expected abundance of these galaxies using the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, GALFORM, which is known to produce a realistic population of galaxies at lower redshifts including the present day. Key to this model is the assumption of a "top-heavy" initial mass function of stars formed in bursts (required to explain the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-millimetre galaxies). Here, we compare the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions derived from JWST observations with those predicted by the Cowley et al. model up to $z=14$ and make further predictions for $z=16$. We find that below $z\sim 10$, the Cowley et al. predictions agree very well with observations, while agreement at $z\gtrsim12$ requires extending the model to take into account the timescale for the growth of obscuring dust grains and its dependence on gas metallicity. We trace the evolution of these galaxies from $z=14$ to $z=0$ and find that their descendants typically reside in halos with a median mass of $10^{13.6}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The stellar masses of the descendants range from $10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to $10^{11.5}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Although these galaxies were all central galaxies at $z=14$, nearly half of their descendants end up as satellites in massive halos.</description>

      <title>Extended emission line regions in post-starburst galaxies hosting tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an extended emission line region (EELR) in MUSE observations of Markarian 950, a nearby ($z=0.01628$) post-starburst (PSB) galaxy that hosted the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF-16fnl. The EELR requires a non-stellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity L$_{\rm ion, min} \gtrsim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inconsistent with the current weak state (L$_{\rm IR,AGN} &lt; 2.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity ($\sim$-50 km s$^{-1}$) and low turbulence ($\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics are not AGN driven. Markarian 950 is the third post-starburst galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of $\sim 10 \times$ higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich post-merger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE-powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.</description>

      <title>Radial X-ray profiles of simulated galaxies: Contributions from hot gas and XRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of structure formation predict the presence of a hot gaseous atmosphere around galaxies. While this hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) has been observationally confirmed through UV absorption lines, the detection of its direct X-ray emission remains scarce. We investigate theoretical predictions of the intrinsic CGM X-ray surface brightness (SB) using simulated galaxies and connect them to their global properties such as gas temperature, hot gas fraction and stellar mass. We select a sample of galaxies from the ultra-high resolution ($48\ \rm{cMpc\, h^{-1}}$) cosmological volume of the Magneticum Pathfinder set of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We classify them as star-forming (SF) or quiescent (QU) based on their specific star-formation rate. For each galaxy we generate X-ray mock data using the X-ray photon simulator PHOX, from which we obtain SB profiles out to the virial radius for different X-ray emitting components, namely gas, active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries (XRBs). We fit a $\beta$-profile to each galaxy and observe trends between its slope and global quantities of the simulated galaxy. We find marginal differences between the average total SB profile of the CGM in SF and QU galaxies, with the contribution from hot gas being the largest ($&gt;50\%$) at radii $r&gt;0.05\,R_{\rm{vir}}$. The contribution from X-ray binaries (XRBs) equals the gas contribution for small radii and is non-zero for large radii. The galaxy population shows positive correlations between global properties and normalization of the SB profile. The slope of fitted $\beta$-profiles correlates strongly with the total gas luminosity, which in turn shows strong connections to the current accretion rate of the central super-massive black hole (SMBH).</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of PTA sources from cosmological initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries (BHBs). While the data do not yet constrain the slope of the spectrum, this appears to flatten at the lowest frequencies, deviating from the power-law shape expected for circular binaries evolving solely due to gravitational wave (GW) emission. Interestingly, such flattening can be explained with a population of eccentric rather than circular binaries. The eccentricity of BHBs is notoriously difficult to predict based simply on the parameters of the host galaxies and the initial galactic orbit, as it is subject to stochastic effects. We study the evolution of the eccentricity of BHBs formed in galactic mergers with cosmological initial conditions from pairing to coalescence, with a focus on potential PTA sources. We select galactic mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation and re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. We then estimate coalescence timescales with a semi-analytical model of the evolution under the effects of GW emission and stellar hardening. We find that most mergers in IllustrisTNG100-1 occur on highly eccentric orbits, and that the eccentricity of BHBs at binary formation correlates with the initial eccentricity of the merger, if this is no larger than approximately 0.9. For extremely eccentric mergers, the binaries tend to form with modest eccentricities. We discuss the implications of these results on the interpretation of the observed GWB.</description>

      <title>No Significant Redshift Evolution in the Intrinsic Scatter of the $M_\bullet$-$M_\star$ Relation for Overmassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the local Universe, the ratio between the mass of a central black hole and the stellar mass of its host galaxy is $\sim 0.1 \%$. Recently, JWST discovered numerous galaxies at $z&gt;4$ that seem to deviate from the local relation, with black holes overmassive by $10-100$ times. Similar galaxies were also discovered at cosmic noon. The intrinsic scatter in the relation describes how much the evolutionary histories of the single galaxies deviate from the mean evolutionary pattern of their parent dataset. This Research Note examines whether a cosmic evolution of the intrinsic scatter can be detected by assessing its value for datasets in various redshift ranges. Using data from the local Universe ($z &lt; 0.055$), low ($ 0.4 \leq z \leq 0.9$), intermediate ($ 0.9 \leq z \leq 4$), and high ($z &gt; 4$) redshift, we conclude that there is no statistically significant redshift evolution of the intrinsic scatter.</description>

      <title>Cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are crucial to understanding role of the environment in galaxy evolution. However, due to their rarity, only a limited number of clusters have been identified at $z\gtrsim2$. In this paper, we report a discovery of seven cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$ in the $3.5\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ area of the XMM-LSS field, roughly doubling the known cluster sample at this frontier redshift if confirmed. We construct a photometric redshift catalog based on deep ($i\sim26$, $K_\mathrm{s}\sim24$) multi-wavelength photometry from $u^*$-band to $K$-band gathered from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and other collaborative/public surveys. We adopt a Gaussian kernel density estimate with two different spatial scales (10" and 60") to draw a density map of massive ($\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&gt;10.5$) and quiescent ($\log(\mathrm{sSFR\, [\mathrm{yr^{-1}}]})&lt;-10$) galaxies at $z\sim2$. Then, We identify seven prominent overdensities. These candidates show clear red sequences in color-magnitude diagrams ($z-H$ vs. $H$). Moreover, one of them shows an extended X-ray emission with $L_\mathrm{X}=(1.46\pm0.35)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, suggesting its virialized nature. There is no clear evidence of enhancement nor suppression of the star formation rate of the main sequence galaxies in the clusters. We find that cluster galaxies have a higher fraction of transition population with $-10.5&lt;\log(\mathrm{sSFR\, [\mathrm{yr^{-1}}]})&lt;-10$ ($12\%$) than the field ($2\%$), which implies the ongoing star formation quenching. The quiescent fraction in the cluster candidates also exceeds that in the field. We confirm that the excess of a quiescent fraction is larger for higher-mass galaxies. This is the first statistical evidence for the mass-dependent environmental quenching at work in clusters even at $z\sim2$.</description>

      <title>Fluorine Abundances in Local Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fluorine measurements in 12 normal giants belonging to the Galactic thin and thick disks using spectra obtained with the Phoenix infrared spectrometer on the 2.1m telescope at Kitt Peak. Abundances are determined from the (1-0) R9 2.3358 micron feature of the molecule HF. Additionally, sodium abundances are derived in 25 giants in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo using the Na I line at 2.3379 microns. We report fluorine abundances for thin and thick disk stars in the metallicity range -0.7 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0. We add two abundance measurements for stars with [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5 dex which are at a critical metallicity range to constrain models. We find a larger dispersion in fluorine abundances than sodium abundances despite both species having similar overall uncertainties due to atmospheric parameters, suggesting this dispersion is real and not observational. The dispersion is slightly larger in the thick disk than the thin. The thin and thick disk average [F/Fe] for our sample of stars combined with the literature differ by 0.03 dex. The observations are compared to available chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Galactic Cirri at High Galactic Latitudes: I. Investigating Scatter in Slopes between Optical and far-Infrared Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the slopes between DESI $g,r$ and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities, specifically $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$, we have constructed a substantial sample of Galactic cirri. This sample covers 561.25 deg$^2$ at high Galactic latitudes (|b| $\geq$ 30$^{\circ}$), allowing for a systematic study of the physical parameters of the Galactic cirrus on a large scale, such as $g-r$ color, dust temperature, asymmetry factor and albedo. The ratio of $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ is consistent with the diffuse Galactic starlight model, suggesting that the diffuse starlight within our own Galaxy serves as the primary illumination source for the cirrus. Both $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ decrease slowly with increasing Galactic latitudes and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities, while they do not have a correlation with Galactic longitudes. The distribution of $k_{g}$ and $k_{r}$ confirms a significant scatter in the slopes, reaching a factor of 4-5. Such large scatter cannot be explained by the weak correlation between the slopes and Galactic latitudes and IRAS 100 $\mu m$ intensities. Instead, it is attributed to substantial variations in the intrinsic properties of the dust, e.g., asymmetry factor and albedo. We propose that the properties of dust particles play a critical role in the observed scatter in slopes, making them the primary contributing factors. Moreover, the variations in dust properties within the cirrus are localized rather than exhibiting large-scale gradients.</description>

      <title>A case study of gas impacted by black-hole jets with the JWST: outflows, bow shocks, and high excitation of the gas in the galaxy IC5063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ~3x2 kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path, and the stability conditions of clouds were known to vary because of these outflows. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is more than 100K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.</description>

      <title>What excites the optical emission in X-ray-selected galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of $1347$ galaxies at $z&lt;0.35$ with detected nuclear X-ray emission and optical emission line diagnostics in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. This sample was obtained by cross-matching the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Observatory - Newton (XMM-Newton) DR10 catalogue with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 galaxies with well-measured line ratios. The distribution of these sources in the BPT diagram covers all three excitation regimes: Ionized Hydrogen (HII) regions (23\%), `composites' (30\%), and Seyfert galaxies with the low ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINERs) (47\%). In contrast, the fraction of objects classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the SDSS subsample selected for cross-match with XMM-Newton is only 13\%. This fact illustrates that X-ray emission from galaxies commonly points towards the presence of AGN. Our data show, for the first time, a clear dependence of the BPT position on the ratio of the X-ray to $H\alpha$ fluxes. Sources dominated by X-ray emission lie in the Seyfert and LINER regimes of the BPT diagram. Most sources with a low X-ray-to-$H\alpha$-luminosity ratio, $log_{10}(L_X/L_{H\alpha}) &lt; 1.0$, lie in the HII regime. In our sample, there are even 45 galaxies that have $L^{Star}_{XR}/L^{Total}_{Xray}&gt;0.5$. In contrast, the positions of the sample members in the BPT diagram exhibit {no} dependence on the X-ray hardness ratio. Our finding suggests that the X-ray-to-$H\alpha$ ratio can help us to differentiate galaxies whose X-ray flux is dominated by an AGN {from galaxies with} central X-ray binaries and other stellar X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Empirical calibration for helium abundance determinations in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, a calibration between the HeI $\lambda5876$/H$\beta$ emission line ratio and the helium abundance $y$=12+log(He/H) for Narrow line regions (NLRs) of Seyfert~2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is proposed. In this context, observational data (taken from the SDSS-DR15 and from the literature) and direct abundance estimates (via the $T_{\rm e}$-method) for a sample of 65 local ($z \: &lt; \: 0.2$) Seyfert~2 nuclei are considered. The resulting calibration estimates the $y$ abundance with an average uncertainty of 0.02 dex. Applying our calibration to spectroscopic data containing only strong emission lines, it yields a helium abundance distribution similar to that obtained via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. Some cautions must be considered to apply our calibration for Seyfert~2 nuclei with high values of electron temperature ($\gtrsim\: 20\,000$ K) or ionization parameter ($\log U &gt; -2.0$).</description>

      <title>How Gaia sheds light on the Milky Way star cluster population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are among the first celestial objects catalogued by early astronomers. As simple and coeval populations, their study has been instrumental in charting the properties of the Milky Way and providing insight into stellar evolution through the 20th century. Clusters were traditionally spotted as local stellar overdensities in the plane of the sky. In recent decades, for a limited number of nearby clusters, it became possible to identify cluster members through their clustering in proper motion space. With its astrometric data of unprecedented precision, the Gaia mission has completely revolutionised our ability to discover and characterise Milky Way star clusters, to map their large-scale distribution, and to investigate their internal structure. In this review we focus on the population of open clusters, residing in the Galactic disc. We summarise the current state of the Gaia-updated cluster census and studies of young clusters and associations. We discuss recent developments in techniques for cluster detection and age estimation. We also review results enabled by Gaia data concerning the dynamical evolution of gravitationally bound clusters and their stellar inventory.</description>

      <title>Probing the distinct extinction law of the Pillars of Creation in M16 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the extinction law in regions of high dust extinction, such as the Pillars of Creation within the M16 region, is crucial for understanding the densest parts of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we utilize observations from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the color-excess ratios $E(F090W-\lambda)/E(F090W-F200W)$ across a wavelength range of $0.9-7.7\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our method involves performing linear regression on color-color diagrams to derive these ratios. The enhanced detection capabilities of JWST data allow us to probe the distinct extinction law to the densest regions in M16 corresponding to an extinction depth up to $A_V \sim 60$\,mag. Remarkably, the resultant color-excess ratio curve exhibits a flatter profile than predicted by typical dust extinction models with $R_V = 5.5$ for dense ISM environments. Moreover, we observe that the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction law diverges from the near-infrared (NIR) power-law, showing a tendency for the slope to flatten as the wavelength increases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dust properties in dense interstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions and tidal disruption events prefer similar host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past five years, six quasi-periodic X-ray eruption (QPE) sources have been discovered in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. Their origin remains an open question. We present MUSE integral field spectroscopy of five QPE host galaxies to characterize their properties. We find that 3/5 galaxies host extended emission line regions (EELRs) up to 10 kpc in size. The EELRs are photo-ionized by a non-stellar continuum, but the current nuclear luminosity is insufficient to power the observed emission lines. The EELRs are decoupled from the stars both kinematically and in projected sky position, and the low velocities and velocity dispersions ($&lt;$ 100 km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 75$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively) are inconsistent with being AGN- or shock-driven. The origin of the EELRs is likely a previous phase of nuclear activity. The QPE host galaxy properties are strikingly similar to those of tidal disruption events (Wevers et al. submitted). The preference for a very short-lived (the typical EELR lifetime is $\sim$15000 years), gas-rich phase where the nucleus has recently faded significantly suggests that TDEs and QPEs may share a common formation channel, disfavoring AGN accretion disk instabilities as the origin of QPEs. In the assumption that QPEs are related to extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs; stellar-mass objects on bound orbits about massive black holes), the high incidence of EELRs and recently faded nuclear activity can be used to aid in the localization of the host galaxies of EMRIs discovered by low frequency gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO. XVII. Measurement of the Hubble Constant from the Lensed Quasar WGD$\,$2038$-$4008</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography is a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The TDCOSMO collaboration is performing an ongoing analysis of lensed quasars to constrain cosmology using this method. In this work, we obtain constraints from the lensed quasar~WGD$\,$2038$-$4008~using new time-delay measurements and previous mass models by TDCOSMO. This is the first TDCOSMO lens to incorporate multiple lens modeling codes and the full time-delay covariance matrix into the cosmological inference. The models are fixed before the time delay is measured, and the analysis is performed blinded with respect to the cosmological parameters to prevent unconscious experimenter bias. We obtain $D_{\Delta t} = 1.68^{+0.40}_{-0.38}$ Gpc using two families of mass models, a power-law describing the total mass distribution, and a composite model of baryons and dark matter, although the composite model is disfavored due to kinematics constraints. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrain the Hubble constant to be $H_{0} = 65^{+23}_{-14}\, \rm km\ s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty comes from the time delays, due to the low variability of the quasar. Future long-term monitoring, especially in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, could catch stronger quasar variability and further reduce the uncertainties. This system will be incorporated into an upcoming hierarchical analysis of the entire TDCOSMO sample, and improved time delays and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics could strengthen the constraints from this system in the future.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: 2MASS J22132050-5137385, the Star with the Highest-known r-process Enhancement at [Eu/Fe] = +2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.20 +- 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050-5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 +- 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 +- 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 10^6 M_sun and a 1 percent metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ~ 600 M_sun.</description>

      <title>cosmICweb: Cosmological Initial Conditions for Zoom-in Simulations in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the online service cosmICweb (COSMological Initial Conditions on the WEB) - the first database and web interface to store, analyze, and disseminate initial conditions for zoom simulations of objects forming in cosmological simulations: from galaxy clusters to galaxies and more. Specifically, we store compressed information about the Lagrangian proto-halo patches for all objects in a typical simulation merger tree along with properties of the halo/galaxy across cosmic time. This enables a convenient web-based selection of the desired zoom region for an object fitting user-specified selection criteria. The information about the region can then be used with the MUSIC code to generate the zoom ICs for the simulation. In addition to some other simulations, we currently support all objects in the EAGLE simulation database, so that for example the Auriga simulations are easily reproduced, which we demonstrate explicitly. The framework is extensible to include other simulations through an API that can be added to an existing database structure and with which cosmICweb can then be interfaced. We make the web portal and database publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Photometry and Radial Distribution of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters from Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost GC regions, which may retain information of the initial configuration of the multiple populations, are poorly studied. We use synthetic spectra that account for the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars of 47 Tucanae to identify the spectral regions that are sensitive to its multiple populations. Hence, we defined new photometric bands that are efficient to disentangle 1P and 2P giant stars from Gaia XP spectra. To test these new filters, we constructed the pseudo two-color diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and identified for the first time, 1P and 2P stars in the outermost cluster regions of 47 Tucanae and outside the tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC3201, NGC6121, NGC6752, and NGC6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs allowed us to clearly disentangle 1P and 2P stars in the external regions of all clusters, with the exception of the metal-poor NGC6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47 Tucanae and NGC 3201 are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P, whereas the multiple populations of NGC 6121, and NGC 6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviors are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC 3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: A comparison of galaxy cluster samples selected on mass, X-ray luminosity, Compton-Y parameter, or galaxy richness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide an avenue to expand our knowledge of cosmology and galaxy evolution. Because it is difficult to accurately measure the total mass of a large number of individual clusters, cluster samples are typically selected using an observable proxy for mass. Selection effects are therefore a key problem in understanding galaxy cluster statistics. We make use of the $(2.8~\rm{Gpc})^3$ FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to investigate how selection based on X-ray luminosity, thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or galaxy richness influences the halo mass distribution. We define our selection cuts based on the median value of the observable at a fixed mass and compare the resulting samples to a mass-selected sample. We find that all samples are skewed towards lower mass haloes. For X-ray luminosity and richness cuts below a critical value, scatter dominates over the trend with mass and the median mass becomes biased increasingly low with respect to a mass-selected sample. At $z\leq0.5$, observable cuts corresponding to median halo masses between $M_\text{500c}=10^{14}$ and $10^{15}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ give nearly unbiased median masses for all selection methods, but X-ray selection results in biased medians for higher masses. For cuts corresponding to median masses $&lt;10^{14}$ at $z\leq0.5$ and for all masses at $z\geq1$, only Compton-Y selection yields nearly unbiased median masses. Importantly, even when the median mass is unbiased, the scatter is not because for each selection the sample is skewed towards lower masses than a mass-selected sample. Each selection leads to a different bias in secondary quantities like cool-core fraction, temperature and gas fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>Detecting Galaxy Tidal Features Using Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low surface brightness substructures around galaxies, known as tidal features, are a valuable tool in the detection of past or ongoing galaxy mergers, and their properties can answer questions about the progenitor galaxies involved in the interactions. The assembly of current tidal feature samples is primarily achieved using visual classification, making it difficult to construct large samples and draw accurate and statistically robust conclusions about the galaxy evolution process. With upcoming large optical imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), predicted to observe billions of galaxies, it is imperative that we refine our methods of detecting and classifying samples of merging galaxies. This paper presents promising results from a self-supervised machine learning model, trained on data from the Ultradeep layer of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, designed to automate the detection of tidal features. We find that self-supervised models are capable of detecting tidal features, and that our model outperforms previous automated tidal feature detection methods, including a fully supervised model. An earlier method applied to real galaxy images achieved 76% completeness for 22% contamination, while our model achieves considerably higher (96%) completeness for the same level of contamination. We emphasise a number of advantages of self-supervised models over fully supervised models including maintaining excellent performance when using only 50 labelled examples for training, and the ability to perform similarity searches using a single example of a galaxy with tidal features.</description>

Abstract: The satellite galaxy Crater II of the Milky Way is extremely cold and exceptionally diffuse. These unusual properties are challenging to understand in the standard model of cold dark matter. We investigate the formation of Crater II in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where dark matter particles can scatter and thermalize. We conduct a series of controlled N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of Crater II, varying the self-interacting cross section, orbit parameters, and initial stellar distribution. Dark matter self-interactions lead to halo core formation and the distribution of stars expands accordingly. A cored SIDM halo also boosts tidal mass loss, allowing for a high orbit. Our simulations show that SIDM halos with a $1~{\rm kpc}$ core can simultaneously explain the low stellar velocity dispersion and the large half-light radius of Crater II, remaining robust to the initial distribution of stars. For the orbit motivated by the measurements from Gaia Early Data Release 3, the favored self-interacting cross section is approximately $60~{\rm cm^2/g}$ on the mass scale of Crater II.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Spatially Extended Stellar Population in M33: A Shallow Stellar Halo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the outer regions of M33, beyond 15 kpc in projected distance from its center using Subaru/HSC multi-color imaging. We identify Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars and Red Clump (RC) stars using the surface gravity sensitive $NB515$ filter for the RGB sample, and a multi-color selection for both samples. We construct the radial surface density profile of these RGB and RC stars, and find that M33 has an extended stellar population with a shallow power-law index of $\alpha &gt; -3$, depending on the intensity of the contamination. This result represents a flatter profile than the stellar halo which has been detected by the previous study focusing on the central region, suggesting that M33 may have a double-structured halo component, i.e. inner/outer halos or a very extended disk. Also, the slope of this extended component is shallower than those typically found for halos in large galaxies, implying intermediate-mass galaxies may have different formation mechanisms (e.g., tidal interaction) from large spirals. We also analyze the radial color profile of RC/RGB stars, and detect a radial gradient, consistent with the presence of an old and/or metal-poor population in the outer region of M33, thereby supporting our proposal that the stellar halo extends beyond 15 kpc. Finally, we estimate that the surface brightness of this extended component is $\mu_{\it V} = 35.72 \pm 0.08$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If our detected component is the stellar halo, this estimated value is consistent with the detection limit of previous observations.</description>

      <title>The Molecular Clouds of M31</title>

Abstract: Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2-1 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission to derive the masses, sizes and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs we find: 1- a highly correlated mass-size relation in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission; 2- a weakly correlated $^{12}$CO linewidth-size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost non-existent, $^{13}$CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and 3-that only 43\% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their $^{13}$CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong $^{12}$CO mass-size relations and much weaker $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO LWS relations. The majority (73\%) of strong $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25\% of the weak $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak $^{13}$CO emitting population decouples the mass-size and LWS relations demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.</description>

      <title>Description of turbulent dynamics in the interstellar medium: Multifractal microcanonical analysis: II. Sparse filtering of Herschel observation maps and visualization of filamentary structures at different length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present significant improvements to our previous work on noise reduction in {\sl Herschel} observation maps by defining sparse filtering tools capable of handling, in a unified formalism, a significantly improved noise reduction as well as a deconvolution in order to reduce effects introduced by the limited instrumental response (beam). We implement greater flexibility by allowing a wider choice of parsimonious priors in the noise-reduction process. More precisely, we introduce a sparse filtering and deconvolution approach approach of type $l^2$-$l^p$, with $p &gt; 0$ variable and apply it to a larger set of molecular clouds using {\sl Herschel} 250 $\mu $m data in order to demonstrate their wide range of application. In the {\sl Herschel} data, we are able to use this approach to highlight extremely fine filamentary structures and obtain singularity spectra that tend to show a significantly less $\log$-normal behavior and a filamentary nature in the less dense regions. We also use high-resolution adaptive magneto-hydrodynamic simulation data to assess the quality of deconvolution in such a simulated beaming framework.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of O(0.0001) by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the western Pictor A hotspot in the hard X-rays with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of X-ray emission from the resolved kiloparsec-scale jets and hotspots of many active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain, particularly where the X-ray emission is separate from the radio-optical synchrotron component. Possible explanations include synchrotron emission from a second electron population and external Compton or synchrotron self-Compton processes -- alternatives which imply very different physical conditions within the jet. Until recently, X-ray studies of resolved jets and hotspots have been restricted to below ~10 keV, often showing a hard spectral index indicating a spectral peak beyond this energy range. Here we present NuSTAR observations of the nearby powerful radio galaxy Pictor A, in which we clearly detect the western hotspot at approximately 4' from the host galaxy, the most significant detection of hotspot emission above 10 keV to date. The NuSTAR spectrum is best fit by a single powerlaw of index $\Gamma$ = 2.03 $\pm$ 0.04; an exponential cut-off gives a 1$\sigma$ lower limit on the cutoff energy of 40.7 keV. We confirm previous findings of variations in the soft X-ray flux detected by Chandra over the 2000 to 2015 period, at a significance of 6.5$\sigma$. This rises to &gt;8$\sigma$ in the common 3-8 keV band using the combined 22-year span of Chandra and NuSTAR observations. The variability of the western Pictor A hotspot strongly confirms the previously argued synchrotron nature of the X-ray emission for the hotspot, while the lower bound to the spectral cutoff energy implies electron energies in the hotspot reach up to at least a few TeV.</description>

      <title>The Gaia white dwarf revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review highlights the role of the Gaia space mission in transforming white dwarf research. These stellar remnants constitute 5-7% of the local stellar population in volume, yet before Gaia the lack of trigonometric parallaxes hindered their identification. The mission's Data Release 2 in 2018 provided the first unbiased colour-absolute magnitude diagram of the local stellar population, identifying 260,000 white dwarfs, with the number later increasing to over 355,000 in Data Release 3. Since then, more than 400 white dwarf studies have made critical use of Gaia data, establishing it as a fundamental resource for white dwarf identification, fundamental parameter determination and more recently spectral type characterisation. The review underscores the routine reliance on Gaia parallaxes and extensive use of its photometry in white dwarf surveys. We also discuss recent discoveries firmly grounded in Gaia data, including white dwarf mergers, exotic compact binaries and evolved planetary systems.</description>
