      <title>Frequency Domain Analysis of Dynamic Light Scattering in the Breast Cancer Risk Screening: A Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of concept for screening breast cancer risk by detecting biochemical alterations in breast tissue using a noninvasive and low-cost technique that uses dynamic light scattering for field effect detection by spectral analysis (FEDSA). This technique consists of a light source that illuminates the tissue, and the backscattering light by the tissue is acquired by two detectors; next, the signal goes to the acquisition system, and then with the designed software the power spectra are calculated. The power spectra contain the frequency contribution related to the size of tissue compounds. These frequency contributions change with the biochemical alterations that are amplified by the field effect on tissue. This implies that the initial alterations in the breast are not local. To test FEDSA, two experiments were performed: the first was with Alumina particles grouped in average sizes of $60-300nm$, $100 - 400nm$ and polystyrene nanoparticles in suspension ($315nm$). The second was with 24 women, 17 of whom had normal tissue and 7 abnormal; abnormalities were previously detected by mammogram or ultrasound. Power spectra were obtained for all particles, in agreement with the particle size. In the case of normal and abnormal tissues, the power spectra of the tissues show differences in the shape of the spectra in the range of 1 to 160 kHz. ROC analysis suggests a possible good sensitivity (87.5\%) and specificity (68.1\%) in classifying breast tissue conditions. Statistical analysis with $p&lt;0.05$ revealed significant differences in two quadrants of the breast, the upper inner right and the upper outer left, which were consistent with previous diagnoses by mammography and ultrasound. This proof of concept opens the possibility of implementing and improving FEDSA in the detection of early anomalies in the breast as a low-cost technique that does not use ionizing radiation.</description>

      <title>Anatomically and mechanically conforming patient-specific spinal fusion cages designed by full-scale topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cage subsidence after instrumented lumbar spinal fusion surgery remains a significant cause of treatment failure, specifically for posterior or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Recent advancements in computational techniques and additive manufacturing, have enabled the development of patient-specific implants and implant optimization to specific functional targets. This study aimed to introduce a novel full-scale topology optimization formulation that takes the structural response of the adjacent bone structures into account in the optimization process. The formulation includes maximum and minimum principal strain constraints that lower strain concentrations in the adjacent vertebrae. This optimization approach resulted in anatomically and mechanically conforming spinal fusion cages. Subsidence risk was quantified in a commercial finite element solver for off-the-shelf, anatomically conforming and the optimized cages, in two representative patients. We demonstrated that the anatomically and mechanically conforming cages reduced subsidence risk by 91% compared to an off-the-shelf implant with the same footprint for a patient with normal bone quality and 54% for a patient with osteopenia. Prototypes of the optimized cage were additively manufactured and mechanically tested to evaluate the manufacturability and integrity of the design and to validate the finite element model.</description>

      <title>SHDB-AF: a Japanese Holter ECG database of atrial fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common atrial arrhythmia that impairs quality of life and causes embolic stroke, heart failure and other complications. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. It is essential for DL models to be robust and generalizable across variations in ethnicity, age, sex, and other factors. Although a number of ECG database have been made available to the research community, none includes a Japanese population sample. Saitama Heart Database Atrial Fibrillation (SHDB-AF) is a novel open-sourced Holter ECG database from Japan, containing data from 100 unique patients with paroxysmal AF. Each record in SHDB-AF is 24 hours long and sampled at 200 Hz, totaling 24 million seconds of ECG data.</description>

      <title>Beneath the Surface: Revealing Deep-Tissue Blood Flow in Human Subjects with Massively Parallelized Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) allows the label-free investigation of microvascular dynamics deep within living tissue. However, common implementations of DCS are currently limited to measurement depths of $\sim 1-1.5cm$, which can limit the accuracy of cerebral hemodynamics measurement. Here we present massively parallelized DCS (pDCS) using novel single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays with up to 500x500 individual channels. The new SPAD array technology can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of up to 500 compared to single-pixel DCS, or by more than 15-fold compared to the most recent state-of-the-art pDCS demonstrations. Our results demonstrate the first in vivo use of this massively parallelized DCS system to measure cerebral blood flow changes at $\sim 2cm$ depth in human adults. We compared different modes of operation and applied a dual detection strategy, where a secondary SPAD array is used to simultaneously assess the superficial blood flow as a built-in reference measurement. While the blood flow in the superficial scalp tissue showed no significant change during cognitive activation, the deep pDCS measurement showed a statistically significant increase in the derived blood flow index of 8-12% when compared to the control rest state.</description>

      <title>Influence of the flow split ratio on the position of the main atrial vortex: implications for stasis on the left atrial appendage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Despite the recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques applied to blood flow within the left atrium (LA), the relationship between atrial geometry, flow patterns, and blood stasis within the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. A better understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as thrombi originating in the LAA are a common cause of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
  Aim: To identify the most representative atrial flow patterns on a patient-specific basis and study their influence on LAA blood stasis by varying the flow split ratio and some common atrial modeling assumptions.
  Methods: Three recent techniques were applied to nine patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of patients with AF: a kinematic atrial model to isolate the influence of wall motion because of AF, projection on a universal LAA coordinate system, and quantification of stagnant blood volume (SBV).
  Results: We identified three different atrial flow patterns based on the position of the center of the main circulatory flow. The results also illustrate how atrial flow patterns are highly affected by the flow split ratio, increasing the SBV within the LAA. As the flow split ratio is determined by the patient's lying position, the results suggest that the most frequent position adopted while sleeping may have implications for the medium- and long-term risks of stroke.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for multi-physics modeling of poro-visco-hyperelasticity-induced time-dependent fracture of blood clots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fracture resistance of blood clots plays a crucial role in physiological hemostasis and pathological thromboembolism. Although recent experimental and computational studies uncovered the poro-viscoelastic property of blood clots and its connection to the time-dependent deformation behavior, the effect of these time-dependent processes on clot fracture and the underlying time-dependent fracture mechanisms are not well understood. This work aims to formulate a thermodynamically consistent, multi-physics theoretical framework for describing the time-dependent deformation and fracture of blood clots. This theory concurrently couples fluid transport through porous fibrin networks, non-linear visco-hyperelastic deformation of the solid skeleton, solid/fluid interactions, mechanical degradation of tissues, gradient enhancement of energy, and protein unfolding of fibrin molecules. The constitutive relations of tissue constituents and the governing equation of fluid transport are derived within the framework of porous media theory by extending non-linear continuum thermodynamics at large strains. A physics-based, compressible network model is developed for the fibrin network of blood clots to describe its mechanical response. An energy-based damage model is developed to predict the damage and fracture of blood clots, and a transient non-local characterization length function is proposed to limit the damage zone bandwidth. The proposed model is experimentally validated using single-edge cracked clot specimens with different constituents. The fracture of blood clots subject to different loading conditions is simulated, and the mechanisms of clot fracture are systematically analyzed. Computational results show that the viscoelasticity and fluid transport play essential roles in the fracture of blood clots under physiological loading.</description>

      <title>CEST-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for CEST MRI Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to propose and investigate the feasibility of using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for CEST MRI data analysis (CEST-KAN). Methods: CEST MRI data were acquired from twelve healthy volunteers at 3T. Data from ten subjects were used for training, while the remaining two were reserved for testing. The performance of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and KAN models with the same network settings were evaluated and compared to the conventional multi-pool Lorentzian fitting (MPLF) method in generating water and multiple CEST contrasts, including amide, relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE), and magnetization transfer (MT). Results: The water and CEST maps generated by both MLP and KAN were visually comparable to the MPLF results. However, the KAN model demonstrated higher accuracy in extrapolating the CEST fitting metrics, as evidenced by the smaller validation loss during training and smaller absolute error during testing. Voxel-wise correlation analysis showed that all four CEST fitting metrics generated by KAN consistently exhibited higher Pearson coefficients than the MLP results, indicating superior performance. Moreover, the KAN models consistently outperformed the MLP models in varying hidden layer numbers despite longer training time. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of utilizing KAN for CEST MRI data analysis, highlighting its superiority over MLP in this task. The findings suggest that CEST-KAN has the potential to be a robust and reliable post-analysis tool for CEST MRI in clinical settings.</description>
