      <title>Identifying a severity measure for head acceleration events associated with suspected concussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To identify a head acceleration event (HAE) severity measure associated with HIA1 removals in elite level rugby union.
  Methods: HAEs were recorded from 215 men and 325 women with 30 and 28 HIA1 removals from men and women, respectively. Logistical regression were calculated to identify if peak power, maximum principal strain (MPS) and or Head Acceleration Response Metric (HARM) were associated with HIA1 events compared to non-cases. Optimal threshold values were determined using the Youden Index. Area under the curve (AUC) were compared using a paired sample approach. Significant differences were set at p&lt;0.05.
  Results: All three severity measures were associated with HIA1 removals in both the mens and womens game. Power performed greatest for HIA1 removals in both the mens and womens games, based on overall AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values. HARM and MPS were found to perform lower than PLA in the womens game based on AUC comparisons (p=0.006 and 0.001, respectively), with MPS performing lower than PAA (p=0.001).
  Conclusion: The findings progress our understanding of HAE measures associated with HIA1 removals. Peak power, a measure based on fundamental mechanics and commonly used in sports performance, may be a suitable HAE severity measure.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Radiofrequency Shimming in MRI using Reconfigurable Dielectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneity of the transmitted radiofrequency field B1+ is a major factor hindering the image quality in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at high field strengths. Here, a novel approach is presented, to locally modulate the B1+ utilizing an array of high permittivity materials with switchable connections. A 3$\times$3 array of barium titanate suspension elements was constructed, with two PIN diode-based switchable connectors per element. Electromagnetic simulations were performed to determine configurations that produce strong B1+ modulation. Remote B1+ field switching was tested in a disk- and and a torso-shaped phantom at 3T by applying different bias voltages to the PIN diodes. The attained B1+ modulation was assessed at various switching pattern positions and various depths within the phantoms. The configuration with the strongest effect size has produced up to 11% modulation in simulations at 15 mm depth, with excellent translation properties. The effects were successfully replicated in phantoms, with a 5 V bias voltage producing up to 11.6$\pm$0.2% modulation. At the relative depth of the human heart, up to 6% of modulation was observed in the torso phantom. The presented method may provide a promising direction for cost-effective, and adaptive B1+ shimming without changes to the scanner hardware.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent F-Numbers Suppress Grating Lobes and Improve the Lateral Resolution in Line-by-Line Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</description>

      <title>Field output correction factors using a fully characterized plastic scintillation detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As small radiation fields play an ever-increasing role in radiation therapy, accurate dosimetry of these fields becomes critical to ensure high quality dose calculation and treatment optimization. The PRB-0002, a new plastic scintillation detector (PSD) part of the Hyperscint RP-200 dosimetric platform from Medscint, can potentially facilitate small field measurements. In this work our objective is twofold: first we perform a detailed characterization of the field output correction factors of the PRB-0002 over a wide range of field sizes; second we demonstrate how this PSD can be used to determine the field output correction factors for other small field detectors. Uncertainties were carefully considered and a detailed uncertainty budget is provided. EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine the impact of detector composition, surrounding materials, dose averaging within the sensitive volume as well as ionization quenching. From these simulations, the field output correction factors of this PSD were determined. Then, by experimental comparisons, field output correction factors for 2 solid state detectors and 3 small volume ion chambers were. With PRB-0002, the material composition was found to be balanced with the ionization quenching making the field output correction factor near unity. For fields between 0.6 $\times$ 0.6 and 30 $\times$ 30~cm$^2$, the field output correction factors of the PRB-0002 were between 1.002 and 0.999 with a total uncertainty of 0.5 %. Analysis of the uncertainty budget showed that an overall uncertainty of 0.59% can be achieved for a 1 $\times$ 1~cm$^2$ using PRB-0002. We conclude that PRB-0002 is a near-ideal detector for small field dosimetry. Furthermore, it can be used to experimentally determine the field output correction factors of other dosimeters with great accuracy.</description>

      <title>AI Enabled High Frame Rate Portable Ultrasound Imaging Pipeline: Prototype Implementation with GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated prototype implementation of a portable ultrasound imaging pipeline on an Nvidia CLARA AGX development kit. The raw data is acquired with nonsteered plane wave transmit using a programmable handheld open platform that supports 128-channel transmit and 64-channel receive. The received signals are transferred to the Nvidia CLARA AGX developer platform through a host system for accelerated imaging. GPU-accelerated implementation of the conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamformer along with two adaptive nonlinear beamformers and two Fourier-based techniques was performed. The feasibility of the complete pipeline and its imaging performance was evaluated with in-vitro phantom imaging experiments and the efficacy is demonstrated with preliminary in-vivo scans. The image quality quantified by the standard contrast and resolution metrics was comparable with that of the CPU implementation. The execution speed of the implemented beamformers was also investigated for different sizes of imaging grids and a significant speedup as high as 180 times that of the CPU implementation was observed. Since the proposed pipeline involves Nvidia CLARA AGX, there is always the potential for easy incorporation of online/active learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Ankle Exoskeletons May Hinder Standing Balance in Simple Models of Older and Younger Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans rely on ankle torque to maintain standing balance, particularly in the presence of small to moderate perturbations. Reductions in maximum torque (MT) production and maximum rate of torque development (MRTD) occur at the ankle with age, diminishing stability. Ankle exoskeletons are powered orthotic devices that may assist older adults by compensating for reduced muscle force and power production capabilities. They may also be able to assist with ankle strategies used for balance. However, no studies have investigated the effect of such devices on balance in older adults. Here, we model the effect ankle exoskeletons have on stability in physics-based models of healthy young and old adults, focusing on the mitigation of age-related deficits such as reduced MT and MRTD. We show that an ankle exoskeleton moderately reduces feasible stability boundaries in users who have full ankle strength. For individuals with age-related deficits, there is a trade-off. While exoskeletons augment stability in low velocity conditions, they reduce stability in some high velocity conditions. Our results suggest that well-established control strategies must still be experimentally validated in older adults.</description>

      <title>Use of Expected Utility (EU) to Evaluate Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Rule-Out Devices for Mammography Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: An artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled rule-out device may autonomously remove patient images unlikely to have cancer from radiologist review. Many published studies evaluate this type of device by retrospectively applying the AI to large datasets and use sensitivity and specificity as the performance metrics. However, these metrics have fundamental shortcomings because they are bound to have opposite changes with the rule-out application of AI. Method: We reviewed two performance metrics to compare the screening performance between the radiologist-with-rule-out-device and radiologist-without-device workflows: positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and expected utility (EU). We applied both methods to a recent study that reported improved performance in the radiologist-with-device workflow using a retrospective U.S. dataset. We then applied the EU method to a European study based on the reported recall and cancer detection rates at different AI thresholds to compare the potential utility among different thresholds. Results: For the U.S. study, neither PPV/NPV nor EU can demonstrate significant improvement for any of the algorithm thresholds reported. For the study using European data, we found that EU is lower as AI rules out more patients including false-negative cases and reduces the overall screening performance. Conclusions: Due to the nature of the retrospective simulated study design, sensitivity and specificity can be ambiguous in evaluating a rule-out device. We showed that using PPV/NPV or EU can resolve the ambiguity. The EU method can be applied with only recall rates and cancer detection rates, which is convenient as ground truth is often unavailable for non-recalled patients in screening mammography.</description>
