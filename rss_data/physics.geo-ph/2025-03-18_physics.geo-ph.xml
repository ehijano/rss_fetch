      <title>Runout of liquefaction-induced tailings dam failure: Influence of earthquake motions and residual strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM) to investigate the runout of liquefaction-induced flow slide failures. The key inputs to this analysis are the earthquake ground motion, which induces liquefaction, and the post-liquefaction residual strength. The influence of these factors on runout is evaluated by subjecting a model of a tailings dam to thirty different earthquake motions and by assigning different values of post-liquefaction residual strength. Ground motions with larger peak ground accelerations (PGA) generate liquefaction to larger depths, thus mobilizing a greater mass of material and resulting in a flow slide with greater runout. However, different ground motions with the same PGA yield significant variations in the depth of liquefaction, indicating that other ground motion characteristics (e.g., frequency content) also exert significant influence over the initiation of liquefaction. Ground motion characteristics of peak ground velocity (PGV) and Modified Acceleration Spectrum Intensity (MASI) show a strong correlation to the induced depth of liquefaction because they capture both the intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motion. The computed runout is directly related to the depth of liquefaction induced by the earthquake motion. For dam geometry analyzed, measurable runout occurs when liquefaction extends to 10 m depth and the runout is maximized when liquefaction extends to about 18 m. Strain-softening of the residual strength of the liquefied tailings during runout is shown to substantially increase the runout distance of the flow slide, highlighting the need for additional research to better characterize the appropriate strength of liquefied materials during flow failures.</description>

      <title>Carbon capture capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal has considerable potential for tree planting related climate change mitigation solutions, considering the sparsity of trees and large portions of non-forested land at the northern forest edge. Moreover, afforestation at the northern boreal edge would enable further the observed gradual tree-line advancement of the taiga into the southern arctic, assisting forests in their migration northward while capitalizing on their carbon capture capacity. However, significant uncertainties remain about the carbon capture capacity of large-scale tree planting in the northern boreal ecozones under changing climatic conditions due to lack of spatially explicit ecozone specific modeling. In this paper, we provide monte carlo estimates of carbon capture capacity of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the north-western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling. We combine satellite-based forest inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate how total ecosystem carbon (TEC) might evolve from 2025 until 2100 under different scenarios composed of fire return intervals (FRI), historical land classes, planting mortality, and climatic variables. Our findings suggest that afforestation at the north-western boreal edge could provide meaningful carbon sequestration toward Canada's climate targets, potentially storing approximately 3.88G Tonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years in the average case resulting from afforestation on approximately 6.4M hectares, with the Northwest Territories (NT)-Taiga Shield West (TSW) zone showing the most potential. Further research is needed to refine these estimates using improved modeling, study economic viability of such a project, and investigate the impact on other regional processes such as permafrost thaw, energy fluxes, and albedo feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Modeling ice cliff stability using a new Mohr-Coulomb-based phase field fracture model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iceberg calving at glacier termini results in mass loss from ice sheets, but the associated fracture mechanics is often poorly represented using simplistic (empirical or elementary mechanics-based) failure criteria. Here, we propose an advanced Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that drives cracking based on the visco-elastic stress state in ice. This criterion is implemented in a phase field fracture framework, and finite element simulations are conducted to determine the critical conditions that can trigger ice cliff collapse. Results demonstrate that fast-moving glaciers with negligible basal friction are prone to tensile failure causing crevasse propagation far away from the ice front; whilst slow-moving glaciers with significant basal friction are likely to exhibit shear failure near the ice front. Results also indicate that seawater pressure plays a major role in modulating cliff failure. For land terminating glaciers, full thickness cliff failure is observed if the glacier exceeds a critical height, dependent on cohesive strength $\tau_\mathrm{c}$ ($H \approx 120\;\text{m}$ for $\tau_\mathrm{c}=0.5\;\text{MPa}$). For marine-terminating glaciers, ice cliff failure occurs if a critical glacier free-board ($H-h_\mathrm{w}$) is exceeded, with ice slumping only observed above the ocean-water height; for $\tau_\mathrm{c} = 0.5\;\text{MPa}$, the model-predicted critical free-board is $H-h_\mathrm{w} \approx 215\;\text{m}$, which is in good agreement with field observations. While the critical free-board height is larger than that predicted by some previous models, we cannot conclude that marine ice cliff instability is less likely because we do not include other failure processes such as hydrofracture of basal crevasses and plastic necking.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of CPT in lateral spreading prediction using Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an autoencoder approach to extract latent features from cone penetration test profiles to evaluate the potential of incorporating CPT data in an AI model. We employ autoencoders to compress 200 CPT profiles of soil behavior type index (Ic) and normalized cone resistance (qc1Ncs) into ten latent features while preserving critical information. We then utilize the extracted latent features with site parameters to train XGBoost models for predicting lateral spreading occurrences in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Models using the latent CPT features outperformed models with conventional CPT metrics or no CPT data, achieving over 83% accuracy. Explainable AI revealed the most crucial latent feature corresponding to soil behavior between 1-3 meter depths, highlighting this depth range's criticality for liquefaction evaluation. The autoencoder approach provides an automated technique for condensing CPT profiles into informative latent features for machine-learning liquefaction models.</description>

      <title>Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of urban seismic signals offers valuable insights into urban environments and society. Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources on a city-wide scale with conventional seismographic network is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies over time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array, we generate spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities, such as traffic, construction, and school operations. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and environmental noise levels, as well as various persistent urban features, including land use patterns and demographics.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>
