      <title>On transience of $M/G/\infty$ queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $M/G/\infty$ queue with infinite expected service time. We then provide the transience/recurrence classification of the states (the system is said to be at state $n$ if there are $n$ customers being served), observing also that here (unlike e.g. irreducible Markov chains) it is possible for recurrent and transient states to coexist.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rates for full-discrete approximations of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equations on 2D torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct space-time full discretizations of stochastic Allen-Cahn equations driven by space-time white noise on 2D torus. The approximations are implemented by tamed exponential Euler discretization in time and spectral Galerkin method in space. We finally obtain the convergence rates with the spatial order of $\alpha-\delta$ and the temporal order of ${\alpha}/{6}-\delta$ in $\mathcal C^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in(0,1/3)$ and $\delta&gt;0$ arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>CLT for Linear Spectral Statistics in High-Dimensional Random Effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sample covariance matrices arising from multi-level components of variance. Thus, let $ B_n=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^NT_{j}^{1/2}x_jx_j^TT_{j}^{1/2}$, where $x_j\in R^n$ are i.i.d. standard Gaussian, and $T_{j}=\sum_{r=1}^kl_{jr}^2\Sigma_{r}$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices with bounded spectral norm, corresponding to $k$ levels of variation. As the matrix dimensions $n$ and $N$ increase proportionally, we show that the linear spectral statistics (LSS) of $B_n$ have Gaussian limits. The CLT is expressed as the convergence of a set of LSS to a standard multivariate Gaussian after centering by a mean vector $\Gamma_n$ and a covariance matrix $\Lambda_n$ which depend on $n$ and $N$ and may be evaluated numerically. Our work is motivated by the estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices between phenotypic traits in quantitative genetics, particularly within nested linear random-effects models with up to $k$ levels of randomness. Our proof builds on the Bai-Silverstein \cite{baisilverstein2004} martingale method with some innovation to handle the multi-level setting.</description>

      <title>Geometric Martingale Benamou-Brenier transport and geometric Bass martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study geometric Bass martingales. Bass martingales were introduced in \cite{Ba83} and studied recently in a series of works, including \cite{BaBeHuKa20,BaBeScTs23}, where they appear as solutions to the martingale version of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport formulation. These arithmetic, as well as our novel geometric, Bass martingales are continuous martingale on $[0,1]$ with prescribed initial and terminal distributions. An arithmetic Bass martingale is the one closest to Brownian motion: its quadratic variation is as close as possible to being linear in the averaged $L^2$ sense. Its geometric counterpart we develop here, is the one closest to a geometric Brownian motion: the quadratic variation of its logarithm is as close as possible to being linear. By analogy between Bachelier and Black-Scholes models in mathematical finance, the newly obtained geometric Bass martingales} have the potential to be of more practical importance in a number of applications.
  Our main contribution is to exhibit an explicit bijection between geometric Bass martingales and their arithmetic counterparts. This allows us, in particular, to translate fine properties of the latter into the new geometric setting. We obtain an explicit representation for a geometric Bass martingale for given initial and terminal marginals, we characterise it as a solution to an SDE, and we show that geometric Brownian motion is the only process which is both an arithmetic and a geometric Bass martingale. Finally, we deduce a dual formulation for our geometric martingale Benamou-Brenier problem. Our main proof is probabilistic in nature and uses a suitable change of measure, but we also provide PDE arguments relying on the dual formulation of the problem, which offer a rigorous proof under suitable regularity assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a logarithmic in $r$ factor. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>A R\'enyi entropy interpretation of anti-concentration and noncentral sections of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Bobkov and Chistyakov's (2015) upper bounds on concentration functions of sums of independent random variables to a multivariate entropic setting. The approach is based on pointwise estimates on densities of sums of independent random vectors uniform on centred Euclidean balls. In this vein, we also obtain sharp bounds on volumes of noncentral sections of isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Explicit Steady-State Approximations for Parallel Server Systems with Heterogeneous Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) load-balancing policy is known to be throughput optimal for parallel server systems with heterogeneous servers. This work concerns the heavy traffic approximation of steady-state performance for parallel server systems operating under WWTA policy. Under a relaxed complete-resource-pooling condition, we prove that WWTA achieves a "strong form" of state-space collapse in heavy traffic and that the scaled workload for each server converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, whose parameter is explicitly given by system primitives. Various steady-state performance measures are shown to be approximated from this exponential random variable. Instead of proving a stochastic process limit followed by an interchange of limits - a method that dominates the literature, our method works directly with a pre-limit basic adjoint relationship (BAR) that characterizes the stationary distribution of each pre-limit system.</description>

      <title>Coarse embeddability, $L^1$-compression and Percolations on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a locally finite, connected graph has a coarse embedding into a Hilbert space if and only if there exist bond percolations with arbitrarily large marginals and two-point function vanishing at infinity. We further show that the decay is stretched exponential with stretching exponent $\alpha\in[0,1]$ if and only if the $L^1$-compression exponent of the graph is at least $\alpha$, leading to a probabilistic characterization of this exponent. These results are new even in the particular setting of Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. The proofs build on a new probabilistic method introduced recently by the authors to study group-invariant percolation on Cayley graphs [24,25], which is now extended to the general, non-symmetric situation of graphs to study their coarse embeddability and compression exponents.</description>

      <title>The frequency process in a non-neutral two-type continuous-state branching process with competition and its genealogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population growth model given by a two-type continuous-state branching process with immigration and competition, introduced by Ma. We study the relative frequency of one of the types in the population when the total mass is forced to be constant at a dense set of times. The resulting process is described as the solution to an SDE, which we call the culled frequency process, generalizing the $\Lambda$-asymmetric frequency process introduced by Caballero et al. We obtain conditions for the culled frequency process to have a moment dual and show that it is given by a branching-coalescing continuous-time Markov chain that describes the genealogy of the two-type CBI with competition. Finally, we obtain a large population limit of the culled frequency process, resulting in a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE). Two particular cases of the limiting ODE are studied to determine if general two-type branching mechanisms and general Malthusians can lead to the coexistence of the two types in the population.</description>

      <title>Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Perspective on Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.</description>

      <title>Strong Approximations for Empirical Processes Indexed by Lipschitz Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents new uniform Gaussian strong approximations for empirical processes indexed by classes of functions based on $d$-variate random vectors ($d\geq1$). First, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for general empirical processes indexed by Lipschitz functions, encompassing and improving on all previous results in the literature. When specialized to the setting considered by Rio (1994), and certain constraints on the function class hold, our result improves the approximation rate $n^{-1/(2d)}$ to $n^{-1/\max\{d,2\}}$, up to the same $\operatorname{polylog} n$ term, where $n$ denotes the sample size. Remarkably, we establish a valid uniform Gaussian strong approximation at the optimal rate $n^{-1/2}\log n$ for $d=2$, which was previously known to be valid only for univariate ($d=1$) empirical processes via the celebrated Hungarian construction (Koml\'os et al., 1975). Second, a uniform Gaussian strong approximation is established for a class of multiplicative separable empirical processes indexed by Lipschitz functions, which address some outstanding problems in the literature (Chernozhukov et al., 2014, Section 3). In addition, two other uniform Gaussian strong approximation results are presented for settings where the function class takes the form of a sequence of Haar basis based on generalized quasi-uniform partitions. We demonstrate the improvements and usefulness of our new strong approximation results with several statistical applications to nonparametric density and regression estimation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Stability of Planar Travelling Waves for Stochastically Perturbed Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion systems with multiplicative noise on a spatial domain of dimension two or higher. The noise process is white in time, coloured in space, and invariant under translations. In the deterministic setting, multidimensional stability of planar waves on the whole space $\mathbb R^d$ has been studied by many. Inspired by previous works on the real line, we establish the multidimensional stability of planar waves on a cylindrical domain on time scales that are exponentially long with respect to the noise strength. This is achieved by means of a stochastic phase tracking mechanism that can be maintained over such long time scales. The corresponding mild formulation of our problem features stochastic integrals with respect to anticipating integrands, which hence cannot be understood within the well-established setting of It\^o-integrals. To circumvent this problem, we exploit and extend recently developed theory concerning forward integrals.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient drift-diffusion processes on a probability simplex set with finite state Wasserstein metrics, namely the Wasserstein common noise. A fact is that the Kolmogorov transition equation of finite reversible Markov jump processes forms the gradient flow of entropy in finite state Wasserstein space. This paper proposes to perturb finite state Markov jump processes with Wasserstein common noises and formulate stochastic reversible Markov jumping processes. We also define a Wasserstein Q-matrix for this stochastic Markov jumping process. We then derive the functional Fokker-Planck equation in probability simplex, whose stationary distribution is a Gibbs distribution of entropy functional in a simplex set. Finally, we present several examples of Wasserstein drift-diffusion processes on a two-point state space.</description>

      <title>Maximum of the Characteristic Polynomial of I.I.D. Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the leading order asymptotic of the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for i.i.d. matrices with real or complex entries. In particular, this result is new even for real Ginibre matrices, which was left as an open problem in [arXiv:2303.09912]; the complex Ginibre case was covered in [arXiv:1902.01983]. These are the first universality results for the non--Hermitian analog of the first order term of the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjecture. Our methods are based on constructing a coupling to the branching random walk via Dyson Brownian motion. In particular, we find a new connection between real i.i.d. matrices and inhomogeneous branching random walk.</description>

      <title>Foundations for conditional probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.03753v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result presented in this article is that probability can fundamentally be characterized as a subset of conditional expectation induced by a plausible preorder on random quantities. This is justified by the fact that probability is coherent as confirmed by its common formalizations, and by our result that a function is coherent if and only if it is a subset of conditional expectation induced by a plausible preorder on random quantities.
  In addition to offering a different perspective on conditional probability, our use of a plausible preorder in the role of a fundamental notion extends conditional probability to cases in which the calculation of conditional probability using the P(A|C)=\frac{P(A\wedge C)}{P(C)} rule fails: if P is a coherent function, then it can be extended so that for every event A and nonzero event C holds that P(A|C)=0 if A\wedge C=0 and P(A|C)=1 if A\wedge C=C, no matter whether the unconditional probability P(C) is zero or whether it is defined.</description>

      <title>Normal approximations for the multivariate inverse Gaussian distribution and asymmetric kernel smoothing on $d$-dimensional half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel density estimator supported on $d$-dimensional half-spaces. It stands out as the first asymmetric kernel smoother for half-spaces in the literature. Using the multivariate inverse Gaussian (MIG) density from Minami (2003) as the kernel and incorporating locally adaptive parameters, the estimator achieves desirable boundary properties. To analyze its mean integrated squared error (MISE) and asymptotic normality, a local limit theorem and probability metric bounds are established between the MIG and the corresponding multivariate Gaussian distribution with the same mean vector and covariance matrix, which may also be of independent interest. Additionally, a new algorithm for generating MIG random vectors is developed, proving to be faster and more accurate than Minami's algorithm based on a Brownian hitting location representation. This algorithm is then used to discuss and compare optimal MISE and likelihood cross-validation bandwidths for the estimator in a simulation study under various target distributions. As an illustration, the MIG asymmetric kernel is used to smooth the posterior distribution of a generalized Pareto model fitted to large electromagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Paucity phenomena for polynomial products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a polynomial with at least two distinct complex roots. We prove that the number of solutions $(x_1, \dots, x_k, y_1, \dots, y_k)\in [N]^{2k}$ to the equation \[
  \prod_{1\le i \le k} P(x_i) = \prod_{1\le j \le k} P(y_j)\neq 0 \] (for any $k\ge 1$) is asymptotically $k!N^{k}$ as $N\to +\infty$. This solves a question first proposed and studied by Najnudel. The result can also be interpreted as saying that all even moments of random partial sums $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\le N}f(P(n))$ match standard complex Gaussian moments as $N\to +\infty$, where $f$ is the Steinhaus random multiplicative function.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for invariant measures of the focusing Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

      <title>The Rate-Distortion-Perception-Classification Tradeoff: Joint Source Coding and Modulation via Inverse-Domain GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework leverages deep learning to learn from data the best codes for source and channel coding. When the output signal, rather than being binary, is directly mapped onto the IQ domain (complex-valued), we call the resulting framework joint source coding and modulation (JSCM). We consider a JSCM scenario and show the existence of a strict tradeoff between channel rate, distortion, perception, and classification accuracy, a tradeoff that we name RDPC. We then propose two image compression methods to navigate that tradeoff: the RDPCO algorithm which, under simple assumptions, directly solves the optimization problem characterizing the tradeoff, and an algorithm based on an inverse-domain generative adversarial network (ID-GAN), which is more general and achieves extreme compression. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings, showing that both algorithms exhibit the RDPC tradeoff. They also demonstrate that the proposed ID-GAN algorithm effectively balances image distortion, perception, and classification accuracy, and significantly outperforms traditional separation-based methods and recent deep JSCM architectures in terms of one or more of these metrics.</description>

      <title>A Random Matrix Approach to Low-Multilinear-Rank Tensor Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive understanding of the estimation of a planted low-rank signal from a general spiked tensor model near the computational threshold. Relying on standard tools from the theory of large random matrices, we characterize the large-dimensional spectral behavior of the unfoldings of the data tensor and exhibit relevant signal-to-noise ratios governing the detectability of the principal directions of the signal. These results allow to accurately predict the reconstruction performance of truncated multilinear SVD (MLSVD) in the non-trivial regime. This is particularly important since it serves as an initialization of the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) scheme, whose convergence to the best low-multilinear-rank approximation depends entirely on its initialization. We give a sufficient condition for the convergence of HOOI and show that the number of iterations before convergence tends to $1$ in the large-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>On Wilks' joint moment formulas for embedded principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1934, the American statistician Samuel S. Wilks derived remarkable formulas for the joint moments of embedded principal minors of sample covariance matrices in multivariate Gaussian populations, and he used them to compute the moments of sample statistics in various applications related to multivariate linear regression. These important but little-known moment results were extended in 1963 by the Australian statistician A. Graham Constantine using Bartlett's decomposition. In this note, a new proof of Wilks' results is derived using the concept of iterated Schur complements, thereby bypassing Bartlett's decomposition. Furthermore, Wilks' open problem of evaluating joint moments of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices is related to the Gaussian product inequality conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to S^1$ be the Steinhaus multiplicative function: a completely multiplicative function such that $(\alpha(p))_{p\text{ prime}}$ are i.i.d.~random variables uniformly distributed on $S^1$. Helson conjectured that $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)|=o(\sqrt{x})$ as $x \to \infty$, and this was solved in strong form by Harper. We give a short proof of the conjecture using a result of Saksman and Webb on a random model for the zeta function.</description>

      <title>Entropy annealing for policy mirror descent in continuous time and space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy regularization has been extensively used in policy optimization algorithms to regularize the optimization landscape and accelerate convergence; however, it comes at the cost of introducing an additional regularization bias. This work quantifies the impact of entropy regularization on the convergence of policy gradient methods for stochastic exit time control problems. We analyze a continuous-time policy mirror descent dynamics, which updates the policy based on the gradient of an entropy-regularized value function and adjusts the strength of entropy regularization as the algorithm progresses. We prove that with a fixed entropy level, the dynamics converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. We further show that when the entropy level decays at suitable polynomial rates, the annealed flow converges to the solution of the unregularized problem at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/S)$ for discrete action spaces and, under suitable conditions, at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{S})$ for general action spaces, with $S$ being the gradient flow time. This paper explains how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus or a Rademacher random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we show that the sum $\sum_{n \le x}\alpha(n) f(n)$, normalised to have mean square $1$, has a non-Gaussian limiting distribution. More precisely, we establish a generalised central limit theorem with random variance determined by the total mass of a random measure associated with $\alpha f$.
  Our result applies to $d_z$, the $z$-th divisor function, as long as $z$ is strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Other examples of admissible $f$-s include any multiplicative indicator function with the property that $f(p)=1$ holds for a set of primes of density strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}$.</description>
