      <title>Kaon Gluon Parton Distribution and Momentum Fraction from 2+1+1 Lattice-QCD with High Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-statistics lattice-QCD determination of the kaon gluon parton distribution function and gluon momentum fraction. We use clover valence fermion action to take 1,296,640 kaon-correlator measurements on a HISQ ensemble with $a \approx 0.12$~fm and 310-MeV pion mass, generated by the MILC collaboration. A detailed investigation into the impact of gauge-link smearing on the gluonic matrix elements indicates that five steps of hypercubic smearing offer an effective balance between signal quality and preservation of long-distance physics. We report a nonperturbatively renormalized kaon gluon momentum fraction of $\langle x \rangle_g^{\overline{\text{MS}}, K} = 0.557(18)_\text{stat}(24)_\text{NPR}(56)_\text{mixing}$ at $\mu = 2$ GeV in in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. Using reduced pseudo-ITD matrix elements and pseudo-PDF matching, we extract the kaon gluon PDF and compare with the prediction from the Dyson-Schwinger equation and with the pion PDF obtained from the same ensemble.</description>

      <title>Euclidean-Monte-Carlo-informed ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>Correlating lepton flavour violating $b \to s$ and leptonic decay modes in a minimal abelian extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an abelian extension of the Standard Model (SM) comprising a new gauge group $U(1)^\prime$, with the neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ having flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. The fermion content is the same as in SM except for the addition of three right-handed neutrinos. The model describes the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to fermions in terms of three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ that sum to zero imposing the cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, a feature producing correlations among quark and lepton observables. We focus on $b \to s \ell_1^- \ell_2^+$ transitions for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and lepton flavour violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. Small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found in the first case, which reflects a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors prevent each other to manifest large discrepancies with respect to SM. We investigate the correlations with the flavour violating leptonic decays $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$. The experimental upper bound on the branching ratio of $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$ constrains the range for the lepton flavour violating $B_{d,s}$ decays, which however are predicted to be within the reach of the planned new facilities.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the radii of oxygen isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an {\em ab initio} study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from $^{16}$O to $^{20}$O using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N$^3$LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the {\em partial pinhole algorithm}, significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for $^{16}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{18}$O closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of $2.810(32)$ fm for $^{20}$O. The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Coherent and dissipative dynamics at quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02626v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-local contributions in $B_{s} \to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ including higher-twist effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) on the non-local form factors for the $B_s\to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ transition focusing on the `charm-loop' contribution within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) framework. To analytically continue these charm-loop contributions into the kinematically allowed region of the decay, we employ a hadronic dispersion relation that incorporates intermediate resonant states such as the $\phi,\,J/\Psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons. Here, the LCSR predictions serve as inputs, supplemented by experimental data from two-body decays $B_s \to \phi ~+$ resonance states. Our results indicate that the inclusion of twist-5 and twist-6 LCDAs enhances the non-local form factors by approximately an order of magnitude compared to previous estimates, due to partial disruption of cancellation among different twist contributions. This leads to a dilepton invariant mass-squared ($q^2$)-dependent correction to the Wilson coefficient $C_9$, which is higher than, but still consistent with the Standard Model prediction without the non-factorizable charm-loop corrections within uncertainties. Additionally, we update the local form factors to include contributions from higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson LCDAs. The phenomenological implications, particularly for the differential branching fraction and angular observables, are also discussed.</description>
