      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Soft Checksums to Flag Untrustworthy Machine Learning Surrogate Predictions and Application to Atomic Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) are attractive as surrogate models to replace costly calculations in physical simulations, but are often unknowingly applied to states not adequately represented in the training dataset. We present the novel technique of soft checksums for scientific machine learning, a general-purpose method to differentiate between trustworthy predictions with small errors on in-distribution (ID) data points, and untrustworthy predictions with large errors on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. By adding a check node to the existing output layer, we train the model to learn the chosen checksum function encoded within the NN predictions and show that violations of this function correlate with high prediction errors. As the checksum function depends only on the NN predictions, we can calculate the checksum error for any prediction with a single forward pass, incurring negligible time and memory costs. Additionally, we find that incorporating the checksum function into the loss function and exposing the NN to OOD data points during the training process improves separation between ID and OOD predictions. By applying soft checksums to a physically complex and high-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium atomic physics dataset, we show that a well-chosen threshold checksum error can effectively separate ID and OOD predictions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic EELS scattering cross-sections for microanalysis based on Dirac solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich information of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) comes from the complex inelastic scattering process whereby fast electrons transfer energy and momentum to atoms, exciting bound electrons from their ground states to higher unoccupied states. To quantify EELS, the common practice is to compare the cross-sections integrated within an energy window or fit the observed spectrum with theoretical differential cross-sections calculated from a generalized oscillator strength (GOS) database with experimental parameters. The previous Hartree-Fock-based and DFT-based GOS are calculated from Schr\"odinger's solution of atomic orbitals, which does not include the full relativistic effects. Here, we attempt to go beyond the limitations of the Schr\"odinger solution in the GOS tabulation by including the full relativistic effects using the Dirac equation within the local density approximation, which is particularly important for core-shell electrons of heavy elements with strong spin-orbit coupling. This has been done for all elements in the periodic table (up to Z = 118) for all possible excitation edges using modern computing capabilities and parallelization algorithms. The relativistic effects of fast incoming electrons were included to calculate cross-sections that are specific to the acceleration voltage. We make these tabulated GOS available under an open-source license to the benefit of both academic users as well as allowing integration into commercial solutions.</description>

      <title>A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to complement advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons in the future. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Symmetry based efficient simulation of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in subwavelength quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>
