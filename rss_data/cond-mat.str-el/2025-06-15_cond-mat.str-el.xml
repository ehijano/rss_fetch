      <title>Anyon dispersion from non-uniform magnetic field on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. Parametrizing the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R&gt;1$ ($R &lt; 1$), we use exact diagonalization to verify nonzero energy-angular momentum dispersion for any $R \neq 1$. For our choice of non-uniform field, we show that any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes for any value of $R$ can be mapped exactly to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons and the resulting anyon dispersion exactly, up to an overall scaling constant, for the cases of short-range and Coulomb interaction. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Stripe order in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of magnetic order in geometrically frustrated quasiperiodic systems, focusing on the interplay between local tile symmetry and frustration-induced constraints. In particular, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and general arguments, we map the phase diagram of the model. For small $J_2$, a N\'eel phase appears, whereas a stripe phase is stable for dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$, despite the system's lack of periodicity. Although long-range stripe order emerges below a critical temperature, unlike in random systems, it is softened by the nucleation of competing stripe domains pinned at specific quasiperiodic sites. This behavior reveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices, where geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine the magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to non-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and other broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Bulk Excitations of Invertible Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the study of topological defects highlight the importance of understanding the multi-dimensional structure of bulk excitations inside a quantum system. When the bulk ground state is trivial, i.e. a product state, excitations on top of it are decoupled from each other and correspond to lower-dimensional phases and their defects within. In this paper, we expand the discussion to invertible phases and study the bulk excitations in, for example, SPT phases, Majorana chains, p + ip superconductors etc. We find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between bulk excitations inside a nontrivial invertible phase and those in a product state. For SPT phases, this can be shown using the symmetric Quantum Cellular Automaton that maps from the product state to the SPT state. More generally, for invertible phases realizable using the Topological Holography construction, we demonstrate the correspondence using the fact that certain gapped boundary conditions of a topological bulk state have only relative distinctions but no absolute ones.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''. This $J_1-J_2$ system may be realized in materials and engineered in quantum circuits, optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Eliashberg Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum criticality plays a central role in understanding non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems. In this review, we explore the quantum critical Eliashberg theory, which extends conventional Eliashberg approaches to non-Fermi liquid regimes governed by critical fluctuations. We discuss the theoretical foundations and recent developments in the field, focusing on the interplay between electronic interactions and bosonic modes near quantum phase transitions as described in the Yukawa-coupled version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Special emphasis is placed on the breakdown of quasiparticle coherence, anomalous scaling behaviour, Cooper pairing without quasiparticles, and emergent universality in different physical settings. Starting from a zero-dimensional "quantum-dot" model, we discuss the generalization to higher spatial dimensions and demonstrate the connection between quantum-critical Eliashberg theory and holographic superconductivity. Our analysis provides a perspective on how quantum criticality shapes the dynamics of strongly correlated metals and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ising versus infinite randomness criticality in arrays of Rydberg atoms trapped with non-perfect tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as an amazing platform for simulating quantum physics in low dimensions. This remarkable success is due to the versatility of lattice geometries achieved by trapping neutral atoms with optical tweezers. On a given lattice, the competition between the repulsive van der Waals potential and the detuning of the laser frequency brings the atoms to highly excited Rydberg states, leading to a variety of exotic phases and quantum phase transitions. Experiments on the simplest one-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum phase transitions into crystalline phases. In addition to standard conformal transitions, numerical simulations have predicted two exotic chiral transitions and a floating phase, raising the question of their experimental realization. However, in reality, optical tweezers have a finite width, which results in small deviations in interatomic distances and disorder in interaction strength. However, disorder can affect the nature of transitions. Infinite randomness criticality in the random transverse-field Ising chain is perhaps the most prominent examples. In this paper, we demonstrate how the disorder typical for Rydberg experiments alters the Ising transition to the period-2 phase. Following the experimental protocol closely, we probe the nature of quantum criticality with Kibble-Zurek dynamics. While we clearly observe infinite randomness for strong disorder and large system sizes, we also report a crossover into a clean Ising transition, which is visible for small system sizes and weak disorder. Our results clearly demonstrate an additional technical constraint on the scalability of Rydberg-based quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Neural Network Wavefunction for a Non-Hermitian Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Gutzwiller Projected States for Doped Antiferromagnets in Fermi-Hubbard Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically compute the low-temperature charge correlators in near-extremal black holes with a planar horizon and an infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ extremal geometry, finding excellent agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.</description>

Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <title>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi Liquids from Subsystem Symmetry Breaking in van der Waals Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.</description>

      <title>Engineering metal-insulator transitions in ultra-thin doped copper sulfides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band structure is essential for understanding the electronic behavior of a material. The delicate engineering of the bands remains challenging because of the complex interplay of electronic, structural, and compositional factors. Here, we demonstrate the formation of distinct metallic and insulating ground states in ultra-thin copper sulfide films by effectively tuning the band structure via changing the composition of Cu and S in the system. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observed a continuous band renormalization and opening of a full gap at low temperatures over a wide range of doping. The electronic origin of this metal-insulator transition is supported by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements, which show no indication of superlattice modulation and lattice symmetry breaking. The evidence of excitonic insulating phase is further provided by carrier density dependent transitions, a combined effect of electron screening and Coulomb interaction strength. Our findings demonstrate the tunability of the band structure of copper sulfides, allowing for new opportunities to study exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, excitonic systems, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+J with linear response parameters predicts non-magnetic oxide band gaps with hybrid-functional accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the mean absolute band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, whereupon the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error falls to half of that reported for HSE06, yet remains larger than for PBE0.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$ have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the $\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</description>
