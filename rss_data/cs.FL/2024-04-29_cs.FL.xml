      <title>Regular Expressions with Backreferences and Lookaheads Capture NLOG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backreferences and lookaheads are vital features to make classical regular expressions (REGEX) practical. Although these features have been widely used, understanding of the unrestricted combination of them has been limited. Practically, most likely no implementation fully supports them. Theoretically, while some studies have addressed these features separately, few have dared to combine them. In those few studies, it has been made clear that the amalgamation of these features renders REGEX significantly expressive. However, no acceptable expressivity bound for REWBLk$\unicode{x2014}$REGEX with backreferences and lookaheads$\unicode{x2014}$has been established.
  We elucidate this by establishing that REWBLk coincides with NLOG, the class of languages accepted by log-space nondeterministic Turing machines (NTMs). In translating REWBLk to log-space NTMs, negative lookaheads are the most challenging part since it essentially requires complementing log-space NTMs in nondeterministic log-space. To address this problem, we revisit Immerman$\unicode{x2013}$Szelepcs\'enyi theorem. In addition, we employ log-space nested-oracles NTMs to naturally handle nested lookaheads of REWBLk. Utilizing such oracle machines, we also present the new result that the membership problem of REWBLk is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Lookahead Games and Efficient Determinisation of History-Deterministic B\"uchi Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main technical contribution is a polynomial-time determinisation procedure for history-deterministic B\"uchi automata, which settles an open question of Kuperberg and Skrzypczak, 2015. A key conceptual contribution is the lookahead game, which is a variant of Bagnol and Kuperberg's token game, in which Adam is given a fixed lookahead. We prove that the lookahead game is equivalent to the 1-token game. This allows us to show that the 1-token game characterises history-determinism for semantically-deterministic B\"uchi automata, which paves the way to our polynomial-time determinisation procedure.</description>

      <title>A Bionic Natural Language Parser Equivalent to a Pushdown Automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly Calculus (AC), proposed by Papadimitriou et al., aims to reproduce advanced cognitive functions through simulating neural activities, with several applications based on AC having been developed, including a natural language parser proposed by Mitropolsky et al. However, this parser lacks the ability to handle Kleene closures, preventing it from parsing all regular languages and rendering it weaker than Finite Automata (FA). In this paper, we propose a new bionic natural language parser (BNLP) based on AC and integrates two new biologically rational structures, Recurrent Circuit and Stack Circuit which are inspired by RNN and short-term memory mechanism. In contrast to the original parser, the BNLP can fully handle all regular languages and Dyck languages. Therefore, leveraging the Chomsky-Sch \H{u}tzenberger theorem, the BNLP which can parse all Context-Free Languages can be constructed. We also formally prove that for any PDA, a Parser Automaton corresponding to BNLP can always be formed, ensuring that BNLP has a description ability equal to that of PDA and addressing the deficiencies of the original parser.</description>
