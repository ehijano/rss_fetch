      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of
  equilibrium configurations of
  a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined
  on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory
  effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive
  Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately
  following a power-law.
  This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory
  behavior of the potential energy surface.
  This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria
  for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles.
  However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the
  observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around
  values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity.
  Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria,
  which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and defective resonances in an acoustic scattering system with sound-hard obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with non-Hermitian degeneracy and exceptional points associated with resonances in an acoustic scattering problem with sound-hard obstacles. The aim is to find non-Hermitian degenerate (defective) resonances using numerical methods. To this end, we characterize resonances of the scattering problem as eigenvalues of a holomorphic integral operator-valued function. This allows us to define defective resonances and associated exceptional points based on the geometric and algebraic multiplicities. Based on the theory on holomorphic Fredholm operator-valued functions, we show fractional-order sensitivity of defective resonances with respect to operator perturbation. This property is particularly important in physics and associated with intriguing phenomena, e.g., enhanced sensing and dissipation. A defective resonance is sought based on the perturbation analysis and Nystr\"om discretization of the boundary integral equation. Numerical evidence of the existence of a defective resonance is provided. The numerical results combined with theoretical analysis provide a new insight into novel concepts in non-Hermitian physics.</description>
