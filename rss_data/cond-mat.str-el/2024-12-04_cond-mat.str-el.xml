      <title>Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Proximity to quantum criticality in the Ising ferromagnet TbV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ towards a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements suggest that this quantum criticality is avoided and reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T due to an excited-state level crossing. Theoretical analysis shows that small changes in the local Hamiltonian can restore the quantum criticality for some in-plane field directions, suggesting that TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is close to a novel quantum tricritical point induced by in-plane magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagram and non-abelian Moore-Read state in double twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have demonstrated the potentials of moir\'e systems in synthesizing exotic quantum phases. Remarkably, twisted multilayer graphene system may also host non-Abelian states competing with charge density wave under Coulomb interaction. Here, through larger scale exact diagonalization simulations, we map out the quantum phase diagram for $\nu=1/2$ system with electrons occupying the lowest moir\`e band of the double twisted bilayer graphene. By increasing the system size, we find the ground state has six-fold near degeneracy and with a finite spectral gap separating the ground states from excited states across a broad range of parameters. Further computation of many-body Chern number establish the topological order of the state, and we rule out possibility of charge density wave orders based on featureless density structure factor. Furthermore, we inspect the particle-cut entanglement spectrum to identify the topological state as a non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Combining all the above evidences we conclude that Moore-Read ground state dominates the quantum phase diagram for the double twisted bilayer graphene system for a broad range of coupling strength with realistic Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Experimental electronic phase diagram in a diamond-lattice antiferromagnetic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Ni-doping effect on the magnetic and electronic properties of thiospinel Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ (0 $\leq x \leq$ 1). The parent compound Co[Co$_{0.3}$Ir$_{1.7}$]S$_4$ exhibits antiferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$ 292 K within the $A$-site diamond sublattice, along with a narrow charge-transfer gap. Upon Ni doping, an insulator-to-metal crossover occurs at $x \sim$ 0.35, and the antiferromagnetism is gradually suppressed, with $T_\mathrm{N}$ decreasing to 23 K at $x =$ 0.7. In the metallic state, a spin-glass-like transition emerges at low temperatures. The antiferromagnetic transition is completely suppressed at $x_\mathrm{c} \sim$ 0.95, around which a non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerges, evident from the $T^\alpha$ temperature dependence with $\alpha \approx$ 1.2-1.3 in resistivity and divergent behavior of $C/T$ in specific heat at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ increases substantially, signifying an enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass. The magnetic phase diagram has been established, in which an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is avoided at $x_\mathrm{c}$. Conversely, the observed glass-like tail above the critical concentration aligns more closely with theoretical predictions for an extended region of quantum Griffiths phase in the presence of strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Simulating Composite Fermion Excitons by Density Functional Theory and Monte Carlo on a Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham density functional method for the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect has recently been developed by mapping the strongly interacting electrons into an auxiliary system of weakly interacting composite fermions (CFs) that experience a density-dependent effective magnetic field. This approach has been successfully applied to explore the edge rescontruction, fractional charge and fractional braiding statistics of quasiparticle excitations. In this work, we investigate composite fermion excitons in the bulk of the disk geometry. By varying the separation of the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs and calculating their energy, we compare the dispersion of the magnetoroton mode with results from other numerical methods, such as exact diagonalization (ED) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Furthermore, through an evaluation of the spectral function, we identify chiral ``graviton'' excitations: a spin $-2$ mode for the particle-like Laughlin state and a spin $2$ mode for the hole-like Laughlin state. This method can be extended to construct neutral collective excitations for other fractional quantum Hall states in disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Hidden magnetic phases in i-MAX compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a high-field magnetic phase in i-MAX compounds exhibiting a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with unprecedented properties, revealed through NMR and AC susceptibility. Intriguingly, as the atomic number of Rare Earth increases, the transition field of this canted AFM phase grows at the expense of the lower-field AFM state. Our findings point to the complexity of the magnetic structure in i-MAX compounds, demonstrating a non-trivial evolution of their phase diagram while increasing both the atomic number of the Rare Earth element and the external field.</description>

      <title>3-phases Confusion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Neural Networks in quantum many-body theory has seen a formidable rise in recent years. Among the many possible applications, one surely is to make use of their pattern recognition power when dealing with the study of equilibrium phase diagram. Within this context, Learning by Confusion has emerged as an interesting, unbiased scheme. The idea behind it briefly consists in iteratively label numerical results in a random way and then train and test a Neural Network; while for a generic random labeling the Network displays low accuracy, the latter shall display a peak when data are divided into a correct, yet unknown way. Here, we propose a generalization of this confusion scheme for systems with more than two phases, for which it was originally proposed. Our construction simply relies on the use of a slightly different Neural Network: from a binary classificator we move to a ternary one, more suitable to detect systems exhibiting three phases. After introducing this construction, we test is onto the free and the interacting Kitaev chain and on the one-dimensional Extended Hubbard model, always finding results compatible with previous works. Our work opens the way to wider use of Learning by Confusion, showing once more the usefulness of Machine Learning to address quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, elastic anomalies and excitations in the field induced phases of CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Evidence for reduced periodic lattice distortion within the Sb-terminated surface layer of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ sparked broad interest, due to the coexistence of a charge density wave (CDW) phase and possible unconventional superconductivity in the material. In this study, we use low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) with a $\mu$m-sized electron beam to explore the periodic lattice distortion at the antimony-terminated surface in the CDW phase. We recorded high-quality backscattering diffraction patterns in ultrahigh vacuum from multiple cleaved samples. Unexpectedly, we did not find superstructure reflexes at intensity levels predicted from dynamical LEED calculations for the reported $2 \times 2 \times 2$ bulk structure. Our results suggest that in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ the periodic lattice distortion accompanying the CDW is less pronounced at Sb-terminated surfaces than in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal order by nonthermal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quench dynamics of systems exhibiting cooperative or almost competitive orders in equilibrium are explored using Ginzburg-Landau theory plus fluctuations. We show that when the renormalization of the free energy by fluctuations is taken into account, anisotropic stiffnesses and relaxation rates of the order parameters can lead to a stabilization of ordered states at transient free energy minima which are distinct from any (global or local) minima of the equilibrium free energy. This theory demonstrates that nonequilibrium fluctuations play a pivotal role in forming nonthermal orders. As nonthermal order and nonthermal fluctuations mutually stabilize each other over some time, this mechanism could be seen as a nonequilibrium variant of the order-by-disorder phenomenon. We discuss the relevance of these findings for systems with intertwined orders, such as high-temperature superconductors and the kagome metals, as well as for systems that show orbital ordering.</description>

      <title>Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below $\mathbf{2^k}$ for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size $\sim \mathbf{k}$ remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of $\mathbf{\sim 1.8^k}$ using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Cosets via Anyon Condensation and Applications to Gapped $\mathrm{\bf{QCD_{2}}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coset construction of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT) defines a 2D CFT by taking the quotient of two previously known chiral algebras. In this work, we use the methods of non-abelian (non-invertible) anyon condensation to describe 2D topological cosets, defined by the special case where the quotient of chiral algebras is a conformal embedding. In this case, the coset has zero central charge, and the coset theory is thus purely topological. Using non-abelian anyon condensation we describe in general the spectrum of line and local operators as well as their fusion, operator product expansion, and the action of the lines on local operators. An important application of our results is to QCD$_{2}$ with massless fermions in any representation that leads to a gapped phase, where topological cosets (conjecturally) describe the infrared fixed point. We discuss several such examples in detail. For instance, we find that the $Spin(8)_{1}/SU(3)_{3}$ and $Spin(16)_{1}/Spin(9)_{2}$ topological cosets appearing at the infrared fixed point of appropriate QCD$_{2}$ theories are described by $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ triality and $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathrm{Rep(S_{3})}$ fusion categories respectively. Additionally, using this setup, we argue that chiral $Spin(8)$ QCD$_{2}$ with massless chiral fermions in the vectorial and spinorial representations is not only gapped, but moreover trivially gapped, with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Universal microscopic descriptions for statistics of particles and extended excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

      <title>Precision study of the massive Schwinger model near quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a numerical analysis of the massive Schwinger model in the presence of a background electric field. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) approach, we efficiently compute the spectrum of the Schwinger model on a staggered lattice with up to 3000 qubits. As a result, we achieve a precise computation of the critical mass of the massive Schwinger model to five digits using four different 'criticality criteria', observing perfect agreement among them. Additionally, we discuss the effect of a four-fermion operator deformation of the Schwinger model and compute the critical mass for various values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which corresponds to a low-temperature expansion in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. We gain analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a system of massless fermions constrained to two space-time dimensions interacting via a $d$ space-time dimensional Maxwell field. Through dimensional reduction and bosonization, the system maps to a massless scalar interacting with a nonlocal Maxwell field through a $F \phi$-coupling. The $d=2$ dimensional case is the usual Schwinger model where the photon gets a mass. More generally, in $2&lt;d&lt;4$ dimensions, the degrees of freedom map to a scalar which undergoes a renormalization group flow; in the ultraviolet, the scalar is free, while in the infrared it has scaling dimension $(4-d)/2$. The infrared is similar to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, and the physically relevant case $d=4$ becomes infrared trivial in the limit of infinite ultraviolet cut-off, consistent with earlier work on the triviality of surface defects in Maxwell theory.</description>

      <title>Negative $c$-axis longitudinal magnetoresistance in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Below the structural transition occurring at $T_s=90$\,K, FeSe exhibits positive transverse magnetoresistance when the current is applied parallel to the $ab$-plane. In this study, we show that, in contrast, when both the magnetic field and the current are aligned along the $c$-axis, the magnetotransport changes significantly. In this configuration, FeSe develops a sizable negative longitudinal magnetoresistance ($\sim$15\% at $T$=10\,K and $\mu_0H$=16\,T) in the nematic phase. We attribute this finding to the effect of the applied magnetic field on the scattering from spin fluctuations. Our observations reflect the intricate interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the nematic phase of FeSe.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Nonlinear Response of UPt$_3$: An augmented Landau approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several heavy fermion materials, including UPt$_3$, exhibit a rapid but gradual rise in the magnetization at a critical field, without an apparent phase transition at any temperature $T&gt;0$, with the possibility of a first order transition at $T \equiv0$. To model such a quantum phase transition it is most appropriate to develop approaches considering the quantum nature of the spins. Within a fully classical framework, we show that it is sufficient to start from a Landau-type free energy with an added Bragg-Williams entropy term to arrive at a number of key experimental features as seen in UPt$_3$. In particular, we show that correctly arriving at the measured (low-field) higher order susceptibilities necessarily invokes an isobestic (crossing) point at a high field in the magnetization isotherms. We also present a full analysis of the angular dependence of the (low-field) linear and nonlinear susceptibilities which when extended also capture the anisotropic high field response of the magnetization. Key to this success is the proper conversion of the evaluated magnetization from constant volume to a constant pressure situation relevant at high fields in heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous symmetry-based database searches have already revealed ubiquitous band topology in nature, while the destiny of band topology under symmetry-breaking is yet to be studied comprehensively. Here we first develop a framework allowing systematically ascertaining topological state evolution as expressed via a tree-like graph for magnetic/non-magnetic crystalline material belonging to any of the 1651 magnetic space groups. Interestingly, we find that specifying different ways of realizing symmetry-breaking leads to various contractions of the tree-like graph, as a new angle of comprehensively characterizing the correlation between a spontaneous symmetry-breaking and any symmetry-group-indicated physics consequence. We also perform a high-throughput investigation on the 1267 stoichiometric magnetic materials ever-experimentally synthesized to reveal a hierarchy of topological states along all continuous paths of symmetry-breaking (preserving the translation symmetry) from the parent magnetic space group to P1. The results in this work are expected to aid experimentalists in selecting feasible and appropriate means to tune band topology towards realistic applications and promote further studies on using tree-like graph to explore the interconnection between topology and other intriguing orderings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials. NF was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a $2\times 2$ array of gated quantum dots. Dopant arrays and gated quantum dots in Si allow for engineering controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes quantum dot arrays good candidates to study NF in different geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3\times 3$ arrays and larger $N\times N$ arrays, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3\times 3$ arrays, and in $N\times N$ arrays for one hole doping of a half-filled band. The ratio of the hopping $t$ to Hubbard on-site repulsion $U$ that defines the onset of NF scales as $1/N^{4}$ as $N$ increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite $U$ for large $N$. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N\times N$ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical $t/U$ for the onset of ferromagnetism scales as $N$ as the loop length increases. We show that the different dependences on size for loops and $N\times N$ arrays can be understood by scaling arguments that highlight the different energy contributions to each form of ferromagnetism. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and correlations in the second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

Abstract: Topological flat bands formed in two-dimensional lattice systems offer unique opportunity to study the fractional phases of matter in the absence of an external magnetic field. Celebrated examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, FQAH effects have been experimentally realized in both the twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) system and the rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e systems. To date, experimental studies mainly focus on the first moir\'e flat band, except a very recent work that studied novel transport properties in higher moir\'e bands of a 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. Here, we present the systematical transport study of approximately 3{\deg} tMoTe2 devices, especially for the second moir\'e band. At {\nu} = -2 and -4, time-reversal-symmetric single and double quantum spin Hall states formed, consistent with the previous observation in 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. On the other hand, we observed ferromagnetism in the second moir\'e band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at {\nu} = -3. At {\nu} = -2.2 to -2.7, finite temperature resistivity minimum with 1/T scaling at low temperatures, and large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance have been observed. Applying out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies pave the way for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moir\'e flat band based on twisted MoTe2 platform.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Exciton crystal melting and destruction by disorder in bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor 1 was studied in the regime of heavy layer imbalance in a recent transport experiment [Zeng2023, arXiv:2306.16995], with intriguing new findings. We demonstrate in this paper that 1) the exciton Wigner crystal in this regime can melt into a superfluid phase, giving rise to re-entrant superfluid behavior; 2) in the presence of disorder, electron and hole Wigner crystals in the two layers go through a locking/decoupling transition as layer separation increases, resulting in a sudden change in the counter flow conductance. Comparison will be made with the findings of experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the antiferromagnetic bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is key to advancing our understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we disentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong correlations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \emph{bosonic} quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we map out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the low-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a partially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile bosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large $t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings shed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated many-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of kinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms with bosonic quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom tweezer arrays, paving the way for future experimental studies of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe our implementation of fermionic tensor network contraction on arbitrary lattices within both a globally ordered and locally ordered formalism. We provide a pedagogical description of these two conventions as implemented for the quimb library. Using hyperoptimized approximate contraction strategies, we present benchmark fermionic projected entangled pair states simulations of finite Hubbard models defined on the three-dimensional diamond lattice and random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.</description>

      <title>Continuous Collapse of the Spin Cycloid in BiFeO3 Thin Films under an Applied Magnetic Field probed by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the rare materials that exhibits multiferroic properties already at room-temperature. Therefore, it offers tremendous potential for future technological applications, such as memory and logic. However, a weak magnetoelectric coupling together with the presence of a noncollinear cycloidal spin order restricts various practical applications of BiFeO3. Therefore, there is a large interest in the search for suitable methods for the modulation of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3. By performing neutron diffraction experiments using a triple-axis instrument we have determined that the spin cycloid can be systematically suppressed by applying a high magnetic field of 10 T in a BiFeO3 thin film of about 100 nm grown on a (110)-oriented SrTiO3 substrate. As predicted by previous theoretical calculations, we observed that the required critical magnetic field to suppress the spin cycloid in a BiFeO3 thin film was lower as compared to the previously reported critical magnetic field for bulk BiFeO3 single crystals. Our experiment reveals that the spin cycloid continuously expands with increasing magnetic field before the complete transformation into a G-type antiferromagnetic spin order. Such tuning of the length of the spin cycloid up to a complete suppression offers new functionalities for future technological applications as in spintronics or magnonics.</description>
