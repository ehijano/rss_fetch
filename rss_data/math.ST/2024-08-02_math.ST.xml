      <title>Strong Oracle Guarantees for Partial Penalized Tests of High Dimensional Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial penalized tests provide flexible approaches to testing linear hypotheses in high dimensional generalized linear models. However, because the estimators used in these tests are local minimizers of potentially non-convex folded-concave penalized objectives, the solutions one computes in practice may not coincide with the unknown local minima for which we have nice theoretical guarantees. To close this gap between theory and computation, we introduce local linear approximation (LLA) algorithms to compute the full and reduced model estimators for these tests and develop theory specifically for the LLA solutions. We prove that our LLA algorithms converge to oracle estimators for the full and reduced models in two steps with overwhelming probability. We then leverage this strong oracle result and the asymptotic properties of the oracle estimators to show that the partial penalized test statistics evaluated at the two-step LLA solutions are approximately chi-square in large samples, giving us guarantees for the tests using specific computed solutions and thereby closing the theoretical gap. We conduct simulation studies to assess the finite-sample performance of our testing procedures, finding that partial penalized tests using the LLA solutions agree with tests using the oracle estimators, and demonstrate our testing procedures in a real data application.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence in Stationary Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary distributions of multivariate diffusion processes have recently been proposed as probabilistic models of causal systems in statistics and machine learning. Motivated by these developments, we study stationary multivariate diffusion processes with a sparsely structured drift. Our main result gives a characterization of the conditional independence relations that hold in a stationary distribution. The result draws on a graphical representation of the drift structure and pertains to conditional independence relations that hold generally as a consequence of the drift's sparsity pattern.</description>

      <title>Efficient subgroup testing in change-plane models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considered here is a hypothesis test for the coefficients in the change-plane regression models to detect the existence of a change plane. The test that is considered is from the class of test problems in which some parameters are not identifiable under the null hypothesis. The classic exponential average tests do not work well in practice. To overcome this drawback, a novel test statistic is proposed by taking the weighted average of the squared score test statistic (WAST) over the grouping parameter's space, which has a closed form from the perspective of the conjugate priors when an appropriate weight is chosen. The WAST significantly improves the power in practice, particularly in cases where the number of the grouping variables is large. The asymptotic distributions of the WAST are derived under the null and alternative hypotheses. The approximation of critical value by the bootstrap method is investigated, which is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, the proposed test method is naturally extended to the generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework, as well as multiple change planes that can test if there are three or more subgroups. The WAST performs well in simulation studies, and its performance is further validated by applying it to real datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Temperature MCMC threshold: the cases of sparse tensor PCA, sparse regression, and a geometric rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last years, there has been a significant amount of work studying the power of specific classes of computationally efficient estimators for multiple statistical parametric estimation tasks, including the estimators classes of low-degree polynomials, spectral methods, and others. Despite that, our understanding of the important class of MCMC methods remains quite poorly understood. For instance, for many models of interest, the performance of even zero-temperature (greedy-like) MCMC methods that simply maximize the posterior remains elusive.
  In this work, we provide an easy to check condition under which the low-temperature Metropolis chain maximizes the posterior in polynomial-time with high probability. The result is generally applicable, and in this work, we use it to derive positive MCMC results for two classical sparse estimation tasks: the sparse tensor PCA model and sparse regression. Interestingly, in both cases, we also leverage the Overlap Gap Property framework for inference (Gamarnik, Zadik AoS '22) to prove that our results are tight: no low-temperature local MCMC method can achieve better performance. In particular, our work identifies the "low-temperature (local) MCMC threshold" for both sparse models. Interestingly, in the sparse tensor PCA model our results indicate that low-temperature local MCMC methods significantly underperform compared to other studied time-efficient methods, such as the class of low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Facilitating heterogeneous effect estimation via statistically efficient categorical modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical covariates such as race, sex, or group are ubiquitous in regression analysis. While main-only (or ANCOVA) linear models are predominant, cat-modified linear models that include categorical-continuous or categorical-categorical interactions are increasingly important and allow heterogeneous, group-specific effects. However, with standard approaches, the addition of cat-modifiers fundamentally alters the estimates and interpretations of the main effects, often inflates their standard errors, and introduces significant concerns about group (e.g., racial) biases. We advocate an alternative parametrization and estimation scheme using abundance-based constraints (ABCs). ABCs induce a model parametrization that is both interpretable and equitable. Crucially, we show that with ABCs, the addition of cat-modifiers 1) leaves main effect estimates unchanged and 2) enhances their statistical power, under reasonable conditions. Thus, analysts can, and arguably should include cat-modifiers in linear regression models to discover potential heterogeneous effects--without compromising estimation, inference, and interpretability for the main effects. Using simulated data, we verify these invariance properties for estimation and inference and showcase the capabilities of ABCs to increase statistical power. We apply these tools to study demographic heterogeneities among the effects of social and environmental factors on STEM educational outcomes for children in North Carolina. An R package lmabc is available.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum Markov chains using coherent absorber post-processing and pattern counting estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two step strategy for estimating one-dimensional dynamical parameters of a quantum Markov chain, which involves quantum post-processing the output using a coherent quantum absorber and a "pattern counting'' estimator computed as a simple additive functional of the outcomes trajectory produced by sequential, identical measurements on the output units. We provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that the estimator achieves the quantum Cram\'{e}-Rao bound in the limit of large output size. Our estimation method is underpinned by an asymptotic theory of translationally invariant modes (TIMs) built as averages of shifted tensor products of output operators, labelled by binary patterns. For large times, the TIMs form a bosonic algebra and the output state approaches a joint coherent state of the TIMs whose amplitude depends linearly on the mismatch between system and absorber parameters. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime the TIMs capture the full quantum Fisher information of the output state. While directly probing the TIMs' quadratures seems impractical, we show that the standard sequential measurement is an effective joint measurement of all the TIMs number operators; indeed, we show that counts of different binary patterns extracted from the measurement trajectory have the expected joint Poisson distribution. Together with the displaced-null methodology of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 245304 2024 this provides a computationally efficient estimator which only depends on the total number of patterns. This opens the way for similar estimation strategies in continuous-time dynamics, expanding the results of Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012 2023.</description>

      <title>A new count model based on Poisson-Transmuted Geometric convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel over-dispersed discrete distribution, namely the PoiTG distribution is derived by the convolution of a Poisson variate and an independently distributed transmuted geometric random variable. This distribution generalizes the geometric, transmuted geometric, and PoiG distributions. Various important statistical properties of this count model, such as the probability generating function, the moment generating function, the moments, the survival function, and the hazard rate function are investigated. Stochastic ordering for the proposed model are also studied in details. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters are obtained using general optimization approach and the EM algorithm approach. It is envisaged that the proposed distribution may prove to be useful for the practitioners for modelling over-dispersed count data compared to its closest competitors.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Pattern Recovery in Penalized and Thresholded Estimation and its Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the framework of penalized estimation where the penalty term is given by a real-valued polyhedral gauge, which encompasses methods such as LASSO, generalized LASSO, SLOPE, OSCAR, PACS and others. Each of these estimators can uncover a different structure or ``pattern'' of the unknown parameter vector. We define a novel and general notion of patterns based on subdifferentials and formalize an approach to measure pattern complexity. For pattern recovery, we provide a minimal condition for a particular pattern to be detected by the procedure with positive probability, the so-called accessibility condition. Using our approach, we also introduce the stronger noiseless recovery condition. For the LASSO, it is well known that the irrepresentability condition is necessary for pattern recovery with probability larger than $1/2$ and we show that the noiseless recovery plays exactly the same role in our general framework, thereby unifying and extending the irrepresentability condition to a broad class of penalized estimators. We also show that the noiseless recovery condition can be relaxed when turning to so-called thresholded penalized estimators: we prove that the accessibility condition is already sufficient (and necessary) for sure pattern recovery by thresholded penalized estimation provided that the signal of the pattern is large enough. Throughout the article, we demonstrate how our findings can be interpreted through a geometrical lens.</description>

      <title>Robust Unsupervised Multi-task and Transfer Learning on Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has been widely used in many real-world applications. One of the simplest and most important unsupervised learning models is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In this work, we study the multi-task learning problem on GMMs, which aims to leverage potentially similar GMM parameter structures among tasks to obtain improved learning performance compared to single-task learning. We propose a multi-task GMM learning procedure based on the EM algorithm that effectively utilizes unknown similarities between related tasks and is robust against a fraction of outlier tasks from arbitrary distributions. The proposed procedure is shown to achieve the minimax optimal rate of convergence for both parameter estimation error and the excess mis-clustering error, in a wide range of regimes. Moreover, we generalize our approach to tackle the problem of transfer learning for GMMs, where similar theoretical results are derived. Additionally, iterative unsupervised multi-task and transfer learning methods may suffer from an initialization alignment problem, and two alignment algorithms are proposed to resolve the issue. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through simulations and real data examples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying multi-task and transfer learning on GMMs with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Identified vaccine efficacy for binary post-infection outcomes under misclassification without monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to meet regulatory approval, pharmaceutical companies often must demonstrate that new vaccines reduce the total risk of a post-infection outcome like transmission, symptomatic disease, severe illness, or death in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Given that infection is a necessary precondition for a post-infection outcome, one can use principal stratification to partition the total causal effect of vaccination into two causal effects: vaccine efficacy against infection, and the principal effect of vaccine efficacy against a post-infection outcome in the patients that would be infected under both placebo and vaccination. Despite the importance of such principal effects to policymakers, these estimands are generally unidentifiable, even under strong assumptions that are rarely satisfied in real-world trials. We develop a novel method to nonparametrically point identify these principal effects while eliminating the monotonicity assumption and allowing for measurement error. Furthermore, our results allow for multiple treatments, and are general enough to be applicable outside of vaccine efficacy. Our method relies on the fact that many vaccine trials are run at geographically disparate health centers, and measure biologically-relevant categorical pretreatment covariates. We show that our method can be applied to a variety of clinical trial settings where vaccine efficacy against infection and a post-infection outcome can be jointly inferred. This can yield new insights from existing vaccine efficacy trial data and will aid researchers in designing new multi-arm clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Selection with Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selection bias is ubiquitous in real-world data, and can lead to misleading results if not dealt with properly. We introduce a conditioning operation on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to model latent selection from a causal perspective. We show that the conditioning operation transforms an SCM with the presence of an explicit latent selection mechanism into an SCM without such selection mechanism, which partially encodes the causal semantics of the selected subpopulation according to the original SCM. Furthermore, we show that this conditioning operation preserves the simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity of SCMs, and commutes with marginalization. Thanks to these properties, combined with marginalization and intervention, the conditioning operation offers a valuable tool for conducting causal reasoning tasks within causal models where latent details have been abstracted away. We demonstrate by example how classical results of causal inference can be generalized to include selection bias and how the conditioning operation helps with modeling of real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework. The code used has been made available for others to use.</description>
