      <title>Assessment of the experimental support for differential simultaneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz transformation describes differential simultaneity, which reflects the offsetting of time with distance between reference frames. Differential simultaneity is essential for Lorentz invariance. Here, the current experimental support for differential simultaneity is assessed. Differential simultaneity can be mathematically removed from the Lorentz transformation to produce an alternate transformation that describes relativistic effects in the absence of differential simultaneity. Differential simultaneity is shown to be required for Lorentz symmetry. The alternate transformation is used as a contrast for the Lorentz transformation to assess whether relativistic experiments provide definitive evidence for differential simultaneity. If the alternate transformation is compatible with an experiment, then the experiment does not provide definitive evidence for differential simultaneity because it can be explained in the absence of differential simultaneity. Here, the alternate transformation is shown to be compatible with the broad array of current relativistic experiments. This implies that current experiments do not provide definitive evidence for differential simultaneity. Thus, an essential aspect of Lorentz symmetry currently lacks definitive experimental support.</description>

      <title>The weak equivalence principle and the Dirac constant: a result from the holographic principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, based on a recent formularization of the holographic principle proposed and investigated by the present author, we show that the weak equivalence principle in general relativity is equivalent to the equivalence between two forms of the Dirac constant, that is, the action of the spin degree of freedom in the two-dimensional Hilbert space and the lower bound in the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. This result follows from an equation between the Euclidean and Lorentzian world-line actions of a massive particle divided by the Dirac constant, via the Wick rotation, by using the Euclidean and Lorentzian actions of a holographic tensor network, whose quantum state is classicalized by introducing the superselection rule.</description>

      <title>Some field equations with composite operators in octonion spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims to explore the impact of composite operators containing a few physical quantities on the gravitational and electromagnetic fields, studying the influencing factors and physical properties of octonion field equations. J. C. Maxwell first utilized the quaternions and vector terminology to describe the electromagnetic fields. The octonions can be used to simultaneously describe the physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the octonion field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque and force. In the octonion spaces, the field strength and quaternion operator are able to combine together to become one composite operator, making an important contribution to the field equations. Similarly, the field potential can also form some composite operators with the quaternion operator, and they have a certain impact on the field equations. Furthermore, other physical quantities can also be combined with the quaternion operator to form several composite operators. In these composite operators, multiple physical quantities can also have a certain impact on the field equations. In other words, the field strength does not occupy a unique central position, compared to other physical quantities in these composite operators. In the field theories described by the octonions, various field equations can be derived from the application of different composite operators. According to different composite operators, it is able to infer the field equations when the field strength or/and field potential make a certain contribution, and it is also possible to deduce several new field equations when the remaining physical quantities play a certain role. This further deepens the understanding of the physical properties of field equations.</description>

      <title>MOND as a transformation between non-inertial reference frames via Sciama's interpretation of Mach's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) correction to Newtonian gravity or inertia is shown to be equivalent to a more fundamental transformation between a non-inertial local reference frame and the fixed background of the observable universe, complying with Mach's principle. Both Newton's gravitational constant and Milgrom's MOND acceleration parameter or scale constant are substituted for two varying, measurable, physical, and cosmological parameters under the justification of Sciama's interpretation of Mach's principle: causally connected mass and size of the universe. This Machian interpretation, scale-invariant and free from fundamental constants and free parameters with the exception of the speed of light as the speed of causality and gravity, is based on relative field intensities of the small and large scale of the universe. It respects the Machian effect from Sciama's model, by which, in absence of a background, rotational speed is undefined up to the speed of light. The Machian MOND approximation is a necessary feature of a phenomenological nonlinear theory of modified inertia or nonlinear theory of modified gravity which incorporates Mach's principle in agreement with galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>A possible statistics loophole in Bell's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell's theorem proves the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and local realistic hidden-variable theories. In this paper we show that, contrary to a common belief, the theoretical proof of Bell's theorem is not affected by counterfactual reasoning. Then, we demonstrate that the experimental verification of this theorem may be affected in an unknowable way by our ignorance about the probability distribution of the hidden variables. Our study is based on the standard theory of random variables, and lays the groundwork for a critical rethinking of Bell's theorem and its consequences.</description>
