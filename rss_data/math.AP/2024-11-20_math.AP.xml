      <title>Optimal transport maps, majorization, and log-subharmonic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a generalization of the Gellerstedt operator with mixed-type Dirichlet boundary conditions to a suitable Tricomi domain, we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of the linear problem and for a generalization of this problem. The classical method introduced by Didenko, which study the energy integral argument, will be used to prove estimates for a specific Tricomi domain.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for the periodic Boltzmann equation with constant collision kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Boltzmann equation with the constant collision kernel in the case of spatially periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geq 2$. Using the existing techniques from nonlinear dispersive PDEs, we prove the local well-posedness result in $L^{2,r}_vH^s_x$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}-\frac{1}{4}$ and $r&gt;\frac{d}{2}$. To reach the result, the main tool we establish is the $L^4$ Strichartz estimate for solutions to the corresponding linear equation.</description>

      <title>On the Helmholtz decomposition in Morrey and block spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields in Morrey, Zorko, and block spaces over bounded or exterior $C^{1}$ domains. Generally speaking, our proofs rely on a careful interplay of localization, flattening, and duality arguments. To accomplish this, we need to extend some classical tools in analysis and PDE theory to those spaces, including Stein extensions, compact embeddings, Poincar\'{e} inequalities, Bogovskii-type theorem, among other ingredients. Some of these findings may be of independent interest and applied to the study of a number of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Wavespeed selection of travelling wave solutions of a two-component reaction-diffusion model of cell invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion system that has previously been developed to model invasion of cells into a resident cell population. This system is a generalisation of the well-studied Fisher--KPP reaction diffusion equation. By explicitly calculating families of travelling wave solutions to this problem, we observe that a general initial condition with either compact support, or sufficiently large exponential decay in the far field, tends to the travelling wave solution that has the largest possible decay at its front. Initial conditions with sufficiently slow exponential decay tend to those travelling wave solutions that have the same exponential decay as their initial conditions. We also show that in the limit that the (nondimensional) resident cell death rate is large, the system has similar asymptotic structure as the Fisher--KPP model with small cut-off factor, with the same universal (leading order) logarithmic dependence on the large parameter. The asymptotic analysis in this limit explains the formation of an interstitial gap (a region preceding the invasion front in which both cell populations are small), the width of which is also logarithmically large in the cell death rate.</description>

      <title>Optimal embedding results for fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s, p}(\Omega)$, with $s\in (0, 1]$ and $p\in[1,+\infty]$. Here, we use the interpolation results in [4] to provide suitable conditions on the exponents $s$ and $p$ so that the spaces $W^{s, p}(\Omega)$ realize a continuous embedding when either $\Omega=\mathbb R^N$ or $\Omega$ is any open and bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary.
  Our results enhance the classical continuous embedding and, when $\Omega$ is any open bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, we also improve the classical compact embeddings.
  All the results stated here are proved to be optimal. Also, our strategy does not require the use of Besov or other interpolation spaces.</description>

      <title>Cost of controllability of the Burgers equation linearized at a steady shock in the vanishing viscosity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Burgers equation linearized at a stationary shock, and investigate its null-controllability cost with a control at the left endpoint. We give an upper and a lower bound on the control time required for this cost to remain bounded in the vanishing viscosity limit, as well as a rough description of an admissible control. The proof relies on complex analysis and adapts methods previously used to tackle the same issue with a constant transport term.</description>

      <title>On sharp anisotropic Hardy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Yanyan Li and Xukai Yan showed the following interesting Hardy inequalities with anisotropic weights: Let $n\geq 2$, $p \geq 1$, $p\alpha &gt; 1-n$, $p(\alpha + \beta)&gt; -n$, then there exists $C &gt; 0$ such that $$\||x|^{\beta}|x'|^{\alpha+1} \nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)} \geq C\||x|^\beta|x'|^\alpha u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \quad \forall\; u\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ Here $x' = (x_1,\ldots, x_{n-1}, 0)$ for $x = (x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. In this note, we will determine the best constant for the above estimate when $p=2$ or $\beta \geq 0$. Moreover, as refinement for very special case of Li-Yan's result in Adv. Math. 2023, we provide explicit estimate for the anisotropic $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>A note on contractive semi-groups on a 1:1 junction for scalar conservation laws and Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any continuous semi-group on $L^1$ which is (i) $L^1-$contractive, (ii) satisfies the conservation law $\partial_t \rho+\partial_x(H(x,\rho))=0$ in $\mathbb{R}_+\times (\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\})$ (for a space discontinuous flux $H(x,p)= H^l(p) {\bf 1}_{x&lt;0}+ H^r(p) {\bf 1}_{x&gt;0}$), and (iii) satisfies natural continuity and scaling properties, is necessarily given by a germ condition at the junction: $\rho(t,0)\in \mathcal G$ a.e., where $\mathcal G$ is a maximal, $L^1-$dissipative and complete germ. In a symmetric way, we prove that any continuous semi-group on $L^\infty$ which is (i) $L^\infty-$contractive, (ii) satisfies with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation $\partial_t u+H(x,\partial_x u)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}_+\times (\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\})$ (for a space discontinuous Hamiltonian $H$ as above), and (iii) satisfies natural continuity and scaling properties, is necessarily given by a flux limited solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Integro-Differential Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a self-contained introduction to the regularity theory for integro-differential elliptic equations, mostly developed in the 21st century. Such a class of equations often arises in analysis, probability theory, mathematical physics, and in several contexts in applied sciences. The authors give a detailed presentation of all the necessary techniques, primarily focusing on the main ideas rather than proving all results in their greatest generality.
  The book starts from the very basics, studying the square root of the Laplacian and weak solutions to linear equations. Then, the authors develop the theory of viscosity solutions to nonlinear equations and prove the main known results in this context. Finally, they study obstacle problems for integro-differential operators and establish the regularity of solutions and free boundaries.
  Almost all the covered material appears in book form for the first time, and several proofs are different (and shorter) than those in the original papers. Moreover, several open problems are listed throughout the book.
  This is a draft of the book ''Integro-Differential Elliptic Equations''. The final version has been published in Progress in Mathematics, vol. 350, Birkh\"auser, 2024.</description>

      <title>On a modified Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model with chemotaxis and nonlinear sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an evolutionary PDE system coupling the Cahn-Hilliard equation with singular potential, mass source and transport effects, to a Brinkman-type relation for the macroscopic velocity field and to a further equation describing the evolution of the concentration of a chemical substance affecting the phase separation process. The main application we have in mind refers to tumor growth models: in particular, the equation for the chemical prescribes that such a substance tends to migrate towards the regions where the tumor cells are more dense and consume it more actively. The cross-diffusion effects characterizing the system are similar to those occurring in the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis. There is, however, a profound difference between the two settings: actually, the Cahn-Hilliard system prescribes a fourth-order dynamics with respect to space variables, whereas most models for chemotaxis are of the second order in space. This fact has a number of specific consequences regarding regularity properties of solutions and conditions ensuring existence. Our main results are devoted to proving existence of weak solutions in the case when the chemotactic sensitivity function depends nonlinearly on the chemical species concentration, and, more precisely, has a slow growth at infinity so to avoid finite-time blowup. We also analyze the asymptotic problem obtained by letting the viscosity go to zero so to get a Darcy flow regime in the limit.</description>

      <title>A Calder\'{o}n Problem for Beltrami Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary, we define an analogue of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Beltrami fields, which are the eigenvectors of the curl operator and play a major role in fluid mechanics. This map sends the normal component of a Beltrami field to its tangential component on the boundary. In this paper we establish two results showing how this normal-to-tangential map encodes geometric information on the underlying manifold. First, we show that the normal-to-tangential map is a pseudodifferential operator of order zero on the boundary whose total symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric at the boundary. Second, we go on to show that a real-analytic simply connected $3$-manifold can be reconstructed from its normal-to-tangential map. Interestingly, since Green's functions do not exist for the Beltrami field equation, a key idea of the proof is to find an appropriate substitute, which turn out to have a natural physical interpretation as the magnetic fields generated by small current loops.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes a two-by-two Temple-type system of conservation laws with discontinuous flux, focusing on applications in traffic modeling. We prove the existence of entropy solutions for initial data with sufficiently small total variation. Additionally, we explicitly construct the corresponding Riemann solver and examine its key properties. To illustrate the impact of the discontinuous flux on the solution, we also present numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The corotational stability postulate: positive incremental Cauchy stress moduli for diagonal, homogeneous deformations in isotropic nonlinear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In isotropic nonlinear elasticity the corotational stability postulate (CSP) is the requirement that \begin{equation*}
  \langle\frac{\mathrm{D}^{\circ}}{\mathrm{D} t}[\sigma] , D \rangle &gt; 0 \quad \forall \ D \in \text{Sym}(3)\setminus \{0\} \, , \end{equation*} where $\frac{\mathrm{D}^{\circ}}{\mathrm{D} t}$ is any corotational stress rate, $\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress and $D = \text{Sym} \, L$, condition $L= \dot{F} \, F^{-1}$ is the deformation rate tensor. For $\widehat{\sigma}(\log V) := \sigma (V)$ it is equivalent to the monotonicity (TSTS-M$^+$) \begin{equation*}
  \langle \widehat{\sigma} (\log V_1) - \widehat{\sigma} (\log V_2) , \log V_1 - \log V_2 \rangle &gt; 0 \quad \forall \ V_1, V_2 \in \text{Sym}^{++}(3), \ V_1 \neq V_2 \, . \end{equation*} For hyperelasticity, (CSP) is in general independent of convexity of the mapping $F \mapsto \mathrm{W}(F)$ or $U \mapsto \widehat{\mathrm{W}}(U)$. Considering a family of diagonal, homogeneous deformations $t \mapsto F(t)$ one can, nevertheless, show that (CSP) implies positive incremental Cauchy stress moduli for this deformation family, including the incremental Young's modulus, the incremental equibiaxial modulus, the incremental planar tension modulus and the incremental bulk modulus. Aside, (CSP) is sufficient for the Baker-Ericksen and tension-extension inequality. Moreover, it implies local invertibility of the Cauchy stress-stretch relation. Together, this shows that (CSP) is a reasonable constitutive stability postulate in nonlinear elasticity, complementing local material stability viz. LH-ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Controlled Occupied Processes and Viscosity Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of occupied processes which record all positions of the state process. Dynamic programming yields nonlinear equations on the space of positive measures. We develop the viscosity theory for this infinite dimensional parabolic $occupied$ PDE by proving a comparison result between sub and supersolutions, and thus provide a characterization of the value function as the unique viscosity solution. Toward this proof, an extension of the celebrated Crandall-Ishii-Lions (second order) Lemma to this setting, as well as finite-dimensional approximations, is established. Examples including the occupied heat equation, and pricing PDEs of financial derivatives contingent on the occupation measure are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a sharp limit H\"older continuity of the solution for the transport equations thanks to a vanishing viscosity analysis. We also derive the same control for parabolic equations and for inviscid Burgers' equation.

      <title>Large Time Behavior of Solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from Namah and Roquejoffre (Commun. Partial Differ. Equations, 1999) and Fathi (C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, S\'er. I, Math., 1998), the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations has been extensively investigated by many authors, mostly on smooth compact manifolds and the flat torus. They all prove that such solutions converge to solutions to a corresponding static problem. We extend this study to the case where the ambient space is a network. The presence of a "flux limiter", that is the choice of appropriate constants on each vertex of the network necessary for the well-posedness of time-dependent problems on networks, enables a richer statement for the convergence compared to the classical setting. We indeed observe that solutions converge to subsolutions to a corresponding static problem depending on the value of the flux limiter. A finite time convergence is also established.</description>

      <title>Derivation of a von K\'arm\'an plate theory for thermoviscoelastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a von K\'arm\'an plate theory from a three-dimensional quasistatic nonlinear model for nonsimple thermoviscoelastic materials in the Kelvin-Voigt rheology, in which the elastic and the viscous stress tensor comply with a frame indifference principle [Mielke-Roub\'{i}\v{c}ek '20]. In a dimension-reduction limit, we show that weak solutions to the nonlinear system of equations converge to weak solutions of an effective two-dimensional system featuring mechanical equations for viscoelastic von K\'arm\'an plates, previously derived in [Friedrich-Kru\v{z}\'ik '20], coupled with a linear heat-transfer equation. The main challenge lies in deriving a priori estimates for rescaled displacement fields and temperatures, which requires the adaptation of generalized Korn's inequalities and bounds for heat equations with $L^1$-data to thin domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a novel stability estimate in $L^\infty _t (L^p _x)$ between the regular Lagrangian flow of a Sobolev vector field and a piecewise affine approximation of such flow. This approximation of the flow is obtained by a (sort of) explicit Euler method, and it is the crucial tool to prove approximation results for the solution of the continuity equation by using the representation of the solution as the push-forward via the regular Lagrangian flow of the initial datum. We approximate the solution in two ways, one probabilistic and one deterministic, using different approximations for both the flow and the initial datum.</description>

      <title>The 2D Gray-Scott system of equations: constructive proofs of existence of localized stationary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for constructing smooth, localized solutions in systems of semi-linear partial differential equations, with a particular emphasis to the Gray-Scott model. Specifically, we construct a natural Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for the study of systems of autonomous semi-linear PDEs, on which products and differential operators are well-defined. Then, given an approximate solution $\mathbf{u}_0$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\mathbf{u}_0$. In particular, we derive a condition under which we prove the existence of a unique solution in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{u}_0$. Such a condition can be verified thanks to the explicit computation of different upper bounds, for which analytical details are presented. Furthermore, we provide an extra condition under which localized patterns are proven to be the limit of an unbounded branch of (spatially) periodic solutions as the period tends to infinity. We then demonstrate our approach by proving (constructively) the existence of four different localized patterns in the 2D Gray-Scott model. In addition, these solutions are proven to satisfy the $D_4$-symmetry. That is, the symmetry of the square. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs are available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: This article addresses the stabilizability of a perturbed quintic defocusing Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ at the $H^1$--energy level, considering the influence of a damping mechanism. More specifically, we establish a profile decomposition for both linear and nonlinear systems and use them to show that, under certain conditions, the sequence of nonlinear solutions can be effectively linearized. Lastly, through microlocal analysis techniques, we prove the local exponential stabilization of the solution to the perturbed Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ showing an observability inequality for the solution of the system under consideration, which is the key result of this work.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability in a free boundary model of active locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contraction-driven self-propulsion of a large class of living cells can be modeled by a Keller-Segel system with free boundaries. The ensuing "active" system, exhibiting both dissipation and anti-dissipation, features stationary and traveling wave solutions. While the former represent static cells, the latter describe propagating pulses (solitary waves) mimicking the autonomous locomotion of the same cells. In this paper we provide the first proof of the asymptotic nonlinear stability of both of such solutions, static and dynamic. In the case of stationary solutions, the linear stability is established using the spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators, and thus linear stability is determined classically, solely by eigenvalues. For traveling waves the picture is more complex because the linearized problem is non-self-adjoint, opening the possibility of a "dark" area in the phase space which is not "visible" in the purely eigenvalue/eigenvector approach. To establish linear stability in this case we employ spectral methods together with the Gearhart-Pruss-Greiner (GPG) theorem, which controls the entire spectrum via bounds on the resolvent operator. For both stationary and traveling wave solutions, nonlinear stability is then proved by showing how the nonlinear part of the problem may be dominated by the linear part and then employing a Gronwall inequality argument. The developed novel methodology can prove useful also in other problems involving non-self-adjoint (non-Hermitian or non-reciprocal) operators which are ubiquitous in the modeling of "active" matter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish local well-posedness results for the Muskat equation in any dimension using modulus of continuity techniques. By introducing a novel quantity \(\beta_\sigma(f_0')\) which encapsulates local monotonicity and slope, we identify a new class of initial data within \(W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)\). This includes scenarios where the product of the maximal and minimal slopes is large, thereby guaranteeing the local existence of a classical solution.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of shock profiles in one spatial dimension for the isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson (NSP) system, which describes the dynamics of ions in a collision-dominated plasma. The NSP system admits a one-parameter family of smooth traveling waves, called shock profiles, for a given far-field condition satisfying the Lax entropy condition. In this paper, we prove that if the initial data is sufficiently close to a shock profile in $H^2$-norm, then the global solution of the Cauchy problem tends to the smooth manifold formed by the parametrized shock profiles as time goes to infinity. This is achieved using the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, which does not require the zero mass condition.</description>

      <title>A note on Ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics with perfectly conducting boundary conditions in the quarter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem in the quarter space for the system of equations of ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics for compressible fluids with perfectly conducting wall boundary conditions. On the two parts of the boundary the solution satisfies different boundary conditions, which make the problem an initial-boundary value problem with non-uniformly characteristic boundary.
  We identify a subspace ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$ of the Sobolev space $H^3(\Omega)$, obtained by addition of suitable boundary conditions on one portion of the boundary, such that for initial data in ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$ there exists a solution in the same space ${{\mathcal H}}^3(\Omega)$, for all times in a small time interval. This yields the well-posedness of the problem combined with a persistence property of full $H^3$-regularity, although in general we expect a loss of normal regularity near the boundary. Thanks to the special geometry of the quarter space the proof easily follows by the "reflection technique".</description>

Abstract: We extend the definition of weak and strong convergence to sequences of Sobolev-functions whose underlying domains themselves are converging. In contrast to previous works, we do so without ever assuming any sort of reference configuration. We then develop the respective theory and counterparts to classical compactness theorems from the fixed domain case. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of these definitions with some examples from applications and compare them to other approaches.</description>

Abstract: Harmonic balls are domains which satisfy the mean-value property for harmonic functions. We establish the existence and uniqueness of harmonic balls on Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces using the obstacle problem formulation of Hele-Shaw flow. We show that LQG harmonic balls are neither Lipschitz domains nor LQG metric balls, and that the boundaries of their complementary connected components are Jordan curves.
  We conjecture that LQG harmonic balls are the scaling limit of internal diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) on random planar maps. In a companion paper, we prove this in the special case of mated-CRT maps.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of non-autonomous systems with nested invariant cone structure and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current paper is devoted to the investigation of the influence of nested invariant cone structure on the dynamics, in the context of non-autonomous (time almost periodic)cases. We first prove that the nested invariant cone structure can persistent under C1 perturbations; and the dynamics of the omega-limit set of any precompact orbit can be reduced to the dynamics of a compact invariant of a suitable finite dimensional system(see Theorem 2.1). In some special cases, the dynamics of any omega-limit set generated by the skew product semiflow of such a system is similar to a one-dimensional system, that is, the omega-limit set contains at most two minimal sets, and any minimal set is an almost automorphic extension of its base flow(a universal phenomenon in multi-frequency driven systems, introduced by S. Bochner), these results are also correct for such systems under C1 small perturbations(see Theorems 2.2, 2.3). To our best knowledge, it is the first paper to touch the global dynamics of abstract non-autonomous systems with invariant nested cones; the setting is general, since it contains an autonomous system plus an almost-periodic perturbation term, and a periodic system with another periodic perturbation term (these two periods are irrationally dependent)as special cases. The results can be viewed as a generalization of important works of W. Shen and Y. Yi(1995 J. Differential Equations 122 114-136) for scalar parabolic equations with separated boundary conditions, Y. Wang(2007 Nonlinearity 20 831-843) for tridiagonal competitive cooperative systems(see Section 4).</description>

  $$ where $\lambda \in \{-1,1\}$ and $p &gt;0$. While the Lie approximation $Z_L$ is known to converge to the solution $u$ when the initial datum $\phi$ is sufficiently smooth, the convergence result for rough initial data is open to question. In this paper, for rough initial data $\phi\in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^d)$, we prove the $L^2$ convergence of the filtered Lie approximation $Z_{flt}$ to the solution $u$ in the mass-subcritical range, $0&lt; p &lt; \frac{4}{d}$. Furthermore, we provide a precise convergence result for radial initial data $\phi\in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>A PDE Perspective on Approximating Nonlocal Periodic Operators with Applications on Neural Networks for Critical SQG Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10879</link>

Abstract: Nonlocal periodic operators in partial differential equations (PDEs) pose challenges in constructing neural network solutions, which typically lack periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel PDE perspective on approximating these nonlocal periodic operators. Specifically, we investigate the behavior of the periodic first-order fractional Laplacian and Riesz transform when acting on nonperiodic functions, thereby initiating a new PDE theory for approximating solutions to equations with nonlocalities using neural networks. Moreover, we derive quantitative Sobolev estimates and utilize them to rigorously construct neural networks that approximate solutions to the two-dimensional periodic critically dissipative Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian symmetric critical gravitating vortices on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics of solutions for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a novel version of three-dimensional (3D) globally modified Navier-Stokes (GMNS) system introduced by [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436], which is very significant from the perspective of deterministic as well as stochastic partial differential equations. Our focus is on examining a stochastic version of the suggested 3D GMNS equations that are perturbed by an infinite-dimensional additive noise. We can consider a rough additive noise (Lebesgue space valued) with this model, which is not appropriate to consider with the system presented in [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436]. One of the technical problems associated with the rough noise is overcome by the use of the corresponding Cameron-Martin (or reproducing kernel Hilbert) space. This article aims to accomplish three objectives. Firstly, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions (in the analytic sense) of the underlying stochastic system using a Doss-Sussman transformation and a primary ingredient Minty-Browder technique. Secondly, we demonstrate the existence of random attractors for the underlying stochastic system in the natural space of square integrable divergence-free functions. Finally, we show the existence of an invariant measure for the underlying stochastic system for any viscosity coefficient $ \nu &gt; 0 $ and uniqueness of invariant measure for sufficiently large $\nu$ by using the exponential stability of solutions. A validation of the proposed version of 3D GMNS equations has also been discussed in the appendix by establishing that the sequence of weak solutions of 3D GMNS equations converges to a weak solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equations as the modification parameter goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures that was introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert (2021), and by using the notion of free moment maps which are convex functions, solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Amp\`ere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko (2012). We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag in the classical case (2014), and which leads to a uniform bound on the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterizing the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms, and a possible notion of a non-commutative (free) Hessian manifold associated with a free Gibbs measure, conjecturally having free analogue properties of a classical Hessian manifold associated with a log-concave measure and considered by Kolesnikov (2012), which has the striking property of having a Ricci curvature bounded from below by $1/2$.</description>
