      <title>Tree-independence number VI. Thetas and pyramids</title>

Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$. Let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid and let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We denote by $\omega(G)$ the size of the largest clique in $G$. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exist integers $c_1(t)$, $c_2(t)$ and $d(t)$ such that every (pyramid, theta, $\mathcal{L}_t$)-free graph $G$ satisfies: i) $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has size at most $\omega(G)^{c_1(t)} \log (|V(G)|)$. ii) If $G$ has at least two vertices, then $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has independence number at most $\log^{c_2(t)} (|V(G)|)$. iii) For any weight function, $G$ has a balanced separator that is contained in the union of the neighborhoods of at most $d(t)$ vertices. These results qualitatively generalize the main theorems of Abrishami et al. (2022) and Chudnovsky et al. (2024). Additionally, we show that there exist integers $c_3(t), c_4(t)$ such that for every (theta, pyramid)-free graph $G$ and for every non-adjacent pair of vertices $a,b \in V(G)$, i) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing at most $w(G)^{c_3(t)}\log(|V(G)|)$ vertices. ii) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing a set of vertices with independence number at most $\log^{c_4(t)}(|V(G)|)$.</description>

      <title>HyP-ASO: A Hybrid Policy-based Adaptive Search Optimization Framework for Large-Scale Integer Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15828v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly solving large-scale Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using traditional solvers is slow due to their NP-hard nature. While recent frameworks based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited for solving large-scale ILPs.</description>

      <title>Improper coloring of toroidal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1,\dots,V_k$ such that $\Delta(\langle V_i\rangle_G)\leq d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$. If $d_1 = \dots = d_k = m$ we say that $G$ is $k$-colorable with defect $m$. A coloring with at least one $d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$, greater than $0$ is called an improper coloring. It is known that toroidal graphs are properly $7$-colorable, therefore they are $7$-colorable with defect $0$. It was also proved that toroidal graphs are $5$-colorable with defect $1$ and $3$-colorable with defect $2$. The question whether they are $4$-colorable with defect $1$ remains open.
  In this paper we focus on improper coloring of toroidal graphs with values of defects being not all equal. We prove that these graphs are $(0,0,0,0,0,1^*)$-colorable, $(0,0,0,0,2)$-colorable and $(0,0,0,1^*,1^*)$-colorable (a star means that there is an improper coloring in which subgraph induced by the corresponding color class contains at most one edge). Choi and Esperet in [Improper coloring of graphs on surfaces, J. Graph Theory $91(1)\,(2019), 16-34$] proved that every graph of Euler genus $eg &gt; 0$ is $(0, 0, 0, 9eg - 4)$-colorable. From this result it follows that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,14)$-colorable. We decreased the value $14$ and proved that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,4)$-colorable.
  We also show that all 6-regular toroidal graphs except $K_7$ and $T_{11}$ are $(0,0,0,1)$-colorable. Finally, we discuss the colorability of graphs embeddable on $N_1$ and show that they are $(0,0,0,2)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Freezing Majority Rule with L-shaped Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the computational complexity of predicting two dimensional freezing majority cellular automata with states $\{-1,+1\}$, where the local interactions are based on an L-shaped neighborhood structure. In these automata, once a cell reaches state $+1$, it remains fixed in that state forever, while cells in state $-1$ update to the most represented state among their neighborhoods. We consider L-shaped neighborhoods, which mean that the vicinity of a given cell $c$ consists in a subset of cells in the north and east of $c$.
  We focus on the prediction problem, a decision problem that involves determining the state of a given cell after a given number of time-steps. We prove that when restricted to the simplest L-shaped neighborhood, consisting of the central cell and its nearest north and east neighbors, the prediction problem belongs to $\mathsf{NC}$, meaning it can be solved efficiently in parallel. We generalize this result for any L-shaped neighborhood of size two. On the other hand, for other L-shaped neighborhoods, the problem becomes $\mathsf{P}$-complete, indicating that the problem might be inherently sequential.</description>

      <title>On the Structural Parameterizations of 2-Club with Triangle Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, the s-Club asks if Gcontains a vertex subset S of at least k vertices such that G[S] has diameter at most s. Recently, Vertex r-Triangle s-Club, and Edge r-Triangle s-Club that generalize the notion of s-Club have been studied by Garvardt et al. [TOCS-2023, IWOCA-2022] from the perspective of parameterized complexity. Given a graph G and an integer k, the Vertex r-Triangle s-Club asks if there is an s-Club S with at least k vertices such that every vertex u \in S is part of at least r triangles in G[S]. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of Vertex r-Triangle s-Club for every integer r &gt;= 1 from the perspective of structural parameters of the input graph. In particular, we provide FPT algorithms for Vertex r-Triangle 2-Club when parameterized by the treewidth (tw) of the input graph, and an XP algorithm when parameterized by the h-index of the input graph. Additionally, when parameterized by the feedback edge number (fes) of the input graph. We provide a kernel of O(fes) edges for Vertex r-Triangle s-Club.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and improving a classical Betti number estimation algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a classical algorithm for estimating the normalized Betti number of an arbitrary simplicial complex was proposed. Motivated by a quantum algorithm with a similar Monte Carlo structure and improved sample complexity, we give a more in-depth analysis of the sample complexity of this classical algorithm. To this end, we present bounds for the variance of the estimators used in the classical algorithm and show that the variance depends on certain combinatorial properties of the underlying simplicial complex. This new analysis leads us to propose an improvement to the classical algorithm which makes the "easy cases easier'', in that it reduces the sample complexity for simplicial complexes where the variance is sufficiently small. We show the effectiveness and limitations of these classical algorithms by considering Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graph models to demonstrate the existence of "easy" and "hard" cases. Namely, we show that for certain models our improvement almost always leads to a reduced sample complexity, and also produce separate regimes where the sample complexity for both algorithms is exponential.</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporally satisfying reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>

      <title>Is Graph Local Complementation Inherently Sequential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local complementation of a graph $G$ on vertex $v$ is an operation that results in a new graph $G*v$, where the neighborhood of $v$ is complemented. Two graph are locally equivalent if on can be reached from the other one through local complementation.
  It was previously established that recognizing locally equivalent graphs can be done in $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ time. We sharpen this result by proving it can be decided in $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(n))$ parallel time with $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ processors.
  As a second contribution, we introduce the Local Complementation Problem, a decision problem that captures the complexity of applying a sequence of local complementations. Given a graph $G$, a sequence of vertices $s$, and a pair of vertices $u,v$, the problem asks whether the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph obtained after applying local complementations according to $s$. Regardless it simplicity, it is proven to be $\mathsf{P}$-complete, therefore it is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable.
  Finally, it is conjectured that Local Complementation Problem remains $\mathsf{P}$-complete when restricted to circle graphs.</description>

      <title>On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
  In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model. Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.</description>
