      <title>Unoriented skein exact triangles in equivariant singular instanton Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant singular instanton Floer theory is a framework that associates to a knot in an integer homology 3-sphere a suite of homological invariants that are derived from circle-equivariant Morse-Floer theory of a Chern-Simons functional for framed singular $SU(2)$-connections. These invariants generalize the instanton knot homology of Kronheimer and Mrowka. In the present work, these constructions are extended from knots to links with non-zero determinant, and several unoriented skein exact triangles are proved in this setting. As a particular case, a categorification of the behavior of the Murasugi signature for links under unoriented skein relations is established. In addition to the exact triangles, Fr{\o}yshov-type invariants for links are defined, and several computations using the exact triangles are carried out. The computations suggest a relationship between Heegaard Floer L-space knots and those knots whose instanton-theoretic categorification of the knot signature is supported in even gradings.
  A main technical contribution of this work is the construction of maps for certain cobordisms between links on which obstructed reducible singular instantons are present. These constructions are inspired by recent work of the first author and Miller Eismeier in the setting of non-singular instanton theory for rational homology 3-spheres.</description>

      <title>Agol cycles of pseudo-Anosov maps on the 2-punctured torus and 5-punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a periodic splitting sequence of a measured train track, an Agol cycle is the part that constitutes a period up to the action of a pseudo-Anosov map and the rescaling by its dilatation. We consider a family of pseudo-Anosov maps on the 2-punctured torus and on the 5-punctured sphere. We present measured train tracks and compute their Agol cycles. We give a condition under which two maps in the defined family are conjugate or not. In the process, we find a new formula for the dilatation.</description>

      <title>Braid monodromy for a trinomial algebraic equation by means of Mellin-Barnes integral representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a braid monodromy representation of functions satisfying an algebraic equation containing three terms (trinomial equation). We follow global analytic continuation of the roots to a trinomial algebraic equation that are expressed by Mellin-Barnes integral representations. We depict braids that arise from the monodromy around all branching points. The global braid monodromy is described in terms of rational twists of strands that yield a classical Artin braid representation of algebraic functions. As a corollary, we get a precise description of the Galois group of a trinomial algebraic equation.</description>

Abstract: We present a new topological method to study the discriminantal loci of an algebraic variety defined in a product of projective spaces. Our approach relies on an efficient use of groupoid to describe the monodromy. As an example, we treat here the discriminantal loci of an hypersurface of bi-degree $(m, n).$</description>

      <title>Admissible Skein Modules and Ansular Functors: A Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite ribbon category, which is a particular case of a cyclic algebra over the operad of genus zero surfaces, there are two possibilities for an extension defined on all three-dimensional handlebodies: On the one hand, one can use the admissible skein module construction of Costantino-Geer-Patureau-Mirand. On other hand, by a construction of the authors using Costello's modular envelope, one can build a so-called ansular functor, a handlebody version of the notion of a modular functor. Unlike the admissible skein modules with their construction through the Reshetikhin-Turaev graphical calculus, the ansular functor is defined purely through a universal property. In this note, we prove the widely held expectation that these constructions are related by giving an isomorphism between them, with the somewhat surprising subtlety that we need to include consistently on one of the sides an additional boundary component labeled by the distinguished invertible object of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik. In other words, the constructions agree on handlebodies up to a `background charge' that becomes trivial in the unimodular case. Our comparison result includes the handlebody group action as well as the skein algebra action.</description>

      <title>Local bi-Lipschitz classification of semialgebraic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.02235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide bi-Lipschitz invariants for finitely determined map germs $f: (\mathbb{K}^n,0) \to (\mathbb{K}^p, 0)$, where $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ or $ \mathbb{C}$. The aim of the paper is to provide partial answers to the following questions:
  Does the bi-Lipschitz type of a map germ $f: (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^p, 0)$ determine the bi-Lipschitz type of the link of $f$ and of the double point set of $f$? Reciprocally, given a map germ $f: (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^p, 0)$, do the bi-Lipschitz types of the link of $f$ and of the double point set of $f$ determine the bi-Lipschitz type of the germ $f: (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^p, 0)$?
  We provide a positive answer to the first question in the case of a finitely determined map germ $f: (\mathbb{R}^n, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^p, 0)$ where $2n-1 \leq p$ (Theorem 3.3). With regard to the second question, for a finitely determined map germ $f : (\mathbb{R}^2,0) \to (\mathbb{R}^3,0),$ we show that a complete set of invariants for the bi-Lipschitz classification with respect to the inner metric of $X_f=f(U)$, where $U$ is a small neighbourhood of the origin in $\mathbb R^2$, is is given by the link of $f$, the image of the double point set of $f$ and the polar curve of a generic projection into the plane (Proposition 4.13). In particular, in the homogeneous parametrization case $f: (\mathbb{R}^2, 0) \to (\mathbb{R}^3, 0)$ of corank 1, we do not need the hypothesis on the equivalence of the image of the double point set (Theorem 5.2). Finally, we apply our results to relate the $C^{0}- \mathcal A$ classes of finitely determined map germs $f$ of corank 1 with homogeneous parametrization and the inner bi-Lipschitz type of $X_f$ (Proposition 5.4).</description>

      <title>A model for horizontally restricted random square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A square-tiled surface (STS) is a (finite, possibly branched) cover of the standard square-torus with possible branching over exactly 1 point. Alternately, STSs can be viewed as finitely many axis-parallel squares with sides glued in parallel pairs. After a labelling of the squares by $\{1, \dots, n\}$, we can describe an STS with $n$ squares using two permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, where $\sigma$ encodes how the squares are glued horizontally and $\tau$ encodes how the squares are glued vertically. Hence, a previously considered natural model for STSs with $n$ squares is $S_n \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution. We modify this model to obtain a new one: We fix $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and let $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n}$ be a conjugacy class of $S_n$ with at most $n^\alpha$ cycles. Then $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n} \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution is a model for STSs with restricted horizontal gluings. We deduce the asymptotic (as $n$ grows) number of components, genus distribution, most likely stratum and set of holonomy vectors of saddle connections for random STSs in this new model.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants and equivariant monopole Floer homology for rational homology three-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model for $S^1$-equivariant monopole Floer homology for rational homology three-spheres via a homological device called $\mathcal{S}$-complex. Using the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional, we define an $\mathbf{R}$-filtration on the (equivariant) complex of monopole Floer homology $HM$. This $\mathbf{R}$-filtration fits $HM$ into a persistent homology theory, from which one can define a numerical quantity called the spectral invariant $\rho$. The spectral invariant $\rho$ is tied with the geometry of the underlying manifold. The main result of the papers shows that $\rho$ provides an obstruction to the existence of positive scalar curvature metric on a ribbon homology cobordism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a power of a word is a k-fold nested commutator while encoding commutator structure in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>

      <title>Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>
