      <title>Emergent chiral toplogical point gaps in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with staggered on-site gain-loss. The results reveal that on-site staggered gain-loss can effectively induce non-Hermitian topological gap without introducing imaginary phase. Further analysis exhibits that five different processes of topological phase transitions, including topological re-entrant phenomena, with the gain-loss intensity increasing. In addition, through the analysis of inverse participation ratios, normalized participation ratios, winding number and other indicators, we find that topological phase transitions occur synchronically with localized phase transitions. Finally, by investigating the properties of dual space eigenfunction, we reveal that the non-Hermitian topological point gaps predicted in this paper are chiral point gaps, which have a pair of skin modes along opposite directions simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information about their surroundings and specific objectives. There is an intriguing perspective is that each process is highly efficient under a given set of conditions. A key question, then, is how close to optimality it is or how efficient it is under given conditions. Here, the concept of "geodesic learning" as the optimal reference process, with which each process can be compared, is introduced and formulated on the basis of geometry. The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system consisting of the environment, termed the "information bath", and a decision-maker is characterized by use of the entropic quantities. This enables one to study the system in analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which gives rise to geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is presented, and the processes of geodesic learning and adaptation are analyzed for illustrating this approach.</description>

      <title>Spin glass model of in-context learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645</link>

Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00572</link>

Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic STI, which has no clean counterpart. Using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find an axion STI characterized by the average axion angle $\bar{\theta}=\pi$, protected by an average $C_4T$ symmetry with $(C_4T)^4=1$. While the exact $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, and hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$, we prove that the $\theta\!=\!\pi$ state cannot be realized in the clean limit if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$. Therefore, the axion STI lacks band insulator correspondence and is thus intrinsic. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and numerically explore its phase diagram, identifying an axion STI phase separated from both band insulators and trivial Anderson insulators by a metallic phase, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. We also argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions. Our work thus provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization.</description>
