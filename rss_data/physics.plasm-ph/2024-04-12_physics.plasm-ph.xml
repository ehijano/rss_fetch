      <title>On the effect of flux-surface shaping on trapped-electron modes in quasi-helically symmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a novel optimization procedure it has been shown that the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) stellarator can be optimized for reduced trapped-electron-mode (TEM) instability [M.J.~Gerard et al., \textit{Nucl.~Fusion} \textbf{63} (2023) 056004]. Presently, with a set of 563 experimental candidate configurations, gyrokinetic simulations are performed to investigate the efficacy of available energy $E_\mathrm{A}$, quasi-helical symmetry, and flux-surface shaping parameters as metrics for TEM stabilization. It is found that lower values of $E_\mathrm{A}$ correlate with reduced growth rates, but only when separate flux-surface shaping regimes are considered. Moreover, configurations with improved quasi-helical symmetry demonstrate a similar reduction in growth rates and less scatter compared to $E_\mathrm{A}$. Regarding flux-surface shaping, a set of helical shaping parameters is introduced that show increased elongation is strongly correlated with reduced TEM growth rates, however, only when the quasi-helical symmetry is preserved. Using a newly derived velocity-space-averaged TEM resonance operator, these trends are analyzed to provide insights into the physical mechanism of the observed stabilization. For elongation, stabilization is attributed to geometric effects that reduce the destabilizing particle drifts across the magnetic field. Regarding quasi-helical symmetry, the TEM resonance in the maximally resonant trapping well is shown to increase as the quasi-helical symmetry is broken, and breaking quasi-helical symmetry increases the prevalence of highly resonant trapping wells. While these results demonstrate the limitations of using any single metric as a linear TEM proxy, it is shown that quasi-helical symmetry and plasma elongation are highly effective metrics for reducing TEM growth rates in helical equilibria.</description>

      <title>I-mode Plasma Confinement Improvement by Real-time Lithium Injection and its Classification on EAST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I-mode is a promising regime for future fusion reactors due to the high energy confinement and the moderate particle confinement. However, the effect of lithium, which has been widely applied for particle recycling and impurity control, on I-mode plasma is still unclear. Recently, experiments of real-time lithium powder injection on I-mode plasma have been carried out in EAST Tokamak. It was found that the confinement performance of the I-mode can be improved by the lithium powder injection, which can strongly reduce electron turbulence (ET) and then trigger ion turbulence (IT). Four different regimes of I-mode have been identified in EAST. The Type I I-mode plasma is characterized by the weakly coherent mode (WCM) and the geodesic-acoustic mode (GAM). The Type II I-mode is featured as the WCM and the edge temperature ring oscillation (ETRO). The Type III I-mode corresponds to the plasma with the co-existence of ETRO, GAM, and WCM. The Type IV I-mode denotes the plasma with only WCM but without ETRO and GAM. It has been observed that WCM and ETRO are increased with lithium powder injection due to the reduction of ion and electron turbulence, and the enhancement of the pedestal electron temperature gradient. EAST experiments demonstrate that lithium powder injection is an effective tool for real-time control and confinement improvement of I-mode plasma.</description>

      <title>Realizing Laser-driven Deuteron Acceleration with Low Energy Spread via In-situ D$_2$O-deposited Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ion pulse by laser-driven acceleration is one of the hot topics in laser plasma physics. In this study, we present a new method for the \textit{In-situ} deposition of an ultra-thin D$_2$O layer on the surface of an aluminum foil target utilizing a spherical D$_2$O capsule. Employing a 10$^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ laser, we achieve the acceleration of 10.8 MeV deuterons with an energy spread of $\Delta$E/E = 4.6% in the most favorable shot. The energy spread depends on the exposure time of the D$_2$O capsule in the vacuum chamber. This method is simple in setup and operation, and has the potential to extend its applicability to other ion species.</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging and electron temperature evolution in laser-driven magnetic reconnection experiments at the National Ignition Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from X-ray imaging of high-aspect-ratio magnetic reconnection experiments driven at the National Ignition Facility. Two parallel, self-magnetized, elongated laser-driven plumes are produced by tiling 40 laser beams. A magnetic reconnection layer is formed by the collision of the plumes. A gated X-ray framing pinhole camera with micro-channel plate (MCP) detector produces multiple images through various filters of the formation and evolution of both the plumes and current sheet. As the diagnostic integrates plasma self-emission along the line of sight, 2-dimensional electron temperature maps $\langle T_e \rangle_Y$ are constructed by taking the ratio of intensity of these images obtained with different filters. The plumes have a characteristic temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 240 \pm 20$ eV at 2 ns after the initial laser irradiation and exhibit a slow cooling up to 4 ns. The reconnection layer forms at 3 ns with a temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 280 \pm 50$ eV as the result of the collision of the plumes. The error bars of the plumes and current sheet temperatures separate at $4$ ns, showing the heating of the current sheet from colder inflows. Using a semi-analytical model, we find that the observed heating of the current sheet is consistent with being produced by electron-ion drag, rather than the conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Optical and Transport Properties of Plasma Mixtures from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the charged particle transport properties of warm dense matter / hot dense plasma mixtures is a challenge for analytical models. High accuracy ab initio methods are more computationally expensive, but can provide critical insight by explicitly simulating mixtures. In this work, we investigate the transport properties and optical response of warm dense carbon-hydrogen mixtures at varying concentrations under either conserved electronic pressure or mass density at a constant temperature. We compare options for mixing the calculated pure species properties to estimate the results of the mixtures. We find that a combination of the Drude model with the Matthiessen's rule works well for DC electron transport and low frequency optical response. This breaks down at higher frequencies, where a volumetric mix of pure-species AC conductivities works better.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically-dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe or proto-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of High-frequency Whistler Waves at Earth's Bow Shock: Further Support for Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We statistically investigate high-frequency whistler waves (with frequencies higher than $\sim 10$ % of the local elect ron cyclotron frequency) at Earth's bow shock using Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) spacecraft observations. We focus specifically on the wave power within the shock transition layer, where we expect electron acceleration via stochastic sh ock drift acceleration (SSDA) to occur associated with efficient pitch-angle scattering by whistler waves. We find that the wave power is positively correlated with both the Alfv\'en Mach number in the normal incidence frame $M_{\rm A}$ and in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$. The empirical relation with $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$ is compared with the theory of SSDA that predicts a threshold wave power proportional to $(M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn})^{-2}$. The result suggests that the wave power exceeds the theoretical threshold for $M_{\rm A} / \cos \theta_{Bn} \gtrsim 30-60$, beyond which efficient electron acceleration is expected. This aligns very well with previous statistical analysis of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock (M. Oka, G eophys.~Res.~Lett., 33, 5, 2006). Therefore, we consider that this study provides further support for SSDA as the mechanism of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock. At higher-Mach-number astrophysical shocks, SSDA will be able to inject electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process for subsequent acceleration to cosmic-ray energies.</description>

      <title>The residual flow in well-optimized stellarators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gyrokinetic theory of the residual flow, in the electrostatic limit, is revisited, with optimized stellarators in mind. We consider general initial conditions for the problem, and identify cases that lead to a non-zonal residual electrostatic potential, i.e. one having a significant component that varies within a flux surface. We investigate the behavior of the ``intermediate residual'' in stellarators, a measure of the flow that remains after geodesic acoustic modes have damped away, but before the action of the slower damping that is caused by unconfined particle orbits. The case of a quasi-isodynamic stellarator is identified as having a particularly large such residual, owing to the small orbit width achieved by optimization.</description>

      <title>Achieving High Polarization of Photons Emitted by Unpolarized Electrons in Ultrastrong Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear Compton scattering driven by ultraintense lasers presents a promising avenue for enhancing the photon energy, brilliance, and setup compactness of $\gamma$-ray sources. However, a significant challenge lies in achieving a high polarization degree with commonly generated unpolarized electrons, thus addressing a longstanding puzzle in the field. Here we investigate the polarization dynamics of photons emitted by an unpolarized electron beam interacting with a counter-propagating ultraintense laser pulse numerically, and propose a novel method to generate highly polarized $\gamma$ rays via nonlinear Compton scattering with the aid of vacuum dichroism effect. Our simulations reveal that high-brilliance $\gamma$ rays with polarization beyond 90\% are feasible in a single-shot interaction, rivaling the highest achieved by any $\gamma$-ray sources to date, based on a developed Monte Carlo method incorporating polarization-resolved tree processes of nonlinear Compton scattering and Breit-Wheeler pair production and one-loop vacuum polarization. This generation method showcases an extraordinary ultra-high polarization degree and a user-friendly all-optical experimental setup, while harnessing the high photon energy and brilliance characteristic of nonlinear Compton scattering sources, thus making it of great potential for experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Resistively controlled primordial magnetic turbulence decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields generated in the early Universe undergo turbulent decay during the radiation-dominated era. The decay is governed by a decay exponent and a decay time. It has been argued that the latter is prolonged by magnetic reconnection, which depends on the microphysical resistivity and viscosity. Turbulence, on the other hand, is not usually expected to be sensitive to microphysical dissipation, which affects only very small scales. We want to test and quantify the reconnection hypothesis in decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. We performed high-resolution numerical simulations with zero net magnetic helicity using the Pencil Code with up to $2048^3$ mesh points and relate the decay time to the Alfv\'en time for different resistivities and viscosities. The decay time is found to be longer than the Alfv\'en time by a factor that increases with increasing Lundquist number to the 1/4 power. The decay exponent is as expected from the conservation of the Hosking integral, but a timescale dependence on resistivity is unusual for developed turbulence and not found for hydrodynamic turbulence. In two dimensions, the Lundquist number dependence is shown to be leveling off above values of $\approx25,000$, independently of the value of the viscosity. Our numerical results suggest that resistivity effects have been overestimated in earlier work. Instead of reconnection, it may be the magnetic helicity density in smaller patches that is responsible for the resistively slow decay. The leveling off at large Lundquist number cannot currently be confirmed in three dimensions.</description>
