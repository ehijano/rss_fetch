      <title>High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with only one term: the nearest neighbor hopping $t$. The hopping is projected into a constrained Hilbert space, in the same spirit as the usual t-J model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been proposed. The ground state in our model is demonstrated as a superconductor from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation on the cylinder with $L_y$ up to 8. Both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping $x$, which is in contrast to high Tc cuprates where the pairing gap decreases with doping. We show that the pairing gap, measured from the spin gap or charge 1e gap, can be above $1.5 t$. Our model can be realized in the double Kondo lattice model relevant to the bilayer nickelate system in the limit of infinite inter-layer spin coupling $J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$, with an inter-layer repulsion $V$ scaling alongside $J_\perp$ to offset the net attraction. In the double Kondo model, there is no fundamental constraint on $J_\perp/t$, allowing the reachable upper bound of $T_c/t$ to be a large number at the order of 0.5. We also argue that the kinetic superconductor discovered in this work can smoothly connect to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, though the pairing gap may be reduced to the order of $0.1 t$ instead of $t$. Given that $t\sim 10^3$K in typical solid state systems, the material realization of the model may be promising to achieve a $T_c$ at the order of hundreds Kelvin. We propose to search for bilayer material with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The extended Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of both nesting and a van Hove singularity at half filling, together with the presence of Dirac cones makes the honeycomb lattice a special laboratory to explore strongly correlated phenomena. For instance, at zero temperature the repulsive [attractive] Hubbard model only undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic [$s$-wave superconducting degenerate with charge density wave (SC-CDW)] for sufficiently strong on-site coupling, $U/t\gtrsim 3.85$ [$U/t\lesssim -3.85$]; in between these, the system is a semi-metal, by virtue of the Dirac cones. The addition of an additional interaction, $V&gt;0$ or $V&lt;0$, between fermions in nearest neighbor orbitals should break the SC-CDW degeneracy giving rise to a phase diagram quite distinct from the one for the square lattice. Here we perform determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the whole phase diagram, covering the four combinations of signs of $U$ and $V$; the use of complex Hubbard-Stratonovich fields renders the region $|V|\leq |U|/3$ free from the `minus sign problem'. We calculate structure factors associated with different orderings, which, together with the double occupancy and the average sign allows us to map out the whole phase diagram. We have found that the SM phase forms a zone from which ordered phases are excluded, preventing the stabilization of a $d$-wave SC phase, i.e., only $s$-wave pairing is allowed.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure evolution induced by the Jahn-Teller effect in mixed-valence silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silver fluoride Ag$_3$F$_5$ consists structurally of square-planar units formed by four fluoride ions coordinated to a central silver ion, which possesses a partially filled $d$-subshell and the formal valence of +5/3. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously published crystal structure of Ag$_3$F$_5$ is unstable due to the Jahn-Teller effect, arising from the presence of two energetically degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states sharing a single electron hole. Through a full structural relaxation within the DFT+U framework, we identified a new crystal structure for Ag$_3$F$_5$ with reduced symmetry and an energy gain of 151~meV per formula unit relative to the published structure. In this relaxed structure, magnetic chains are formed by silver ions with an electronic hole occupying the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. These results highlight the crucial role of electron correlation effects and related structural distortions in determining the properties of such materials.</description>

      <title>Correlated topological flat bands in rhombohedral graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands and nontrivial topological physics are two important topics of condensed matter physics. With a unique stacking configuration analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, rhombohedral graphite (RG) is a potential candidate for realizing both flat bands and nontrivial topological physics. Here we report experimental evidence of topological flat bands (TFBs) on the surface of bulk RG, which are topologically protected by bulk helical Dirac nodal lines via the bulk-boundary correspondence. Moreover, upon {\it in situ} electron doping, the surface TFBs show a splitting with exotic doping evolution, with an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the lower split band, and pinning of the upper band near the Fermi level. These experimental observations together with Hartree-Fock calculations suggest that correlation effects are important in this system. Our results demonstrate RG as a new platform for investigating the rich interplay between nontrivial band topology, correlation effects, and interaction-driven symmetry-broken states.</description>

      <title>Superpositions of tree-tensor networks for single-reference ground states in the strong correlation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermionic many-body problem in the strong correlation regime is notoriously difficult to tackle. In a previous work (Phys. Rev. B 101, 045109 (2020)), we have proposed to extend the single-reference coupled-cluster (SRCC) method to the strong correlation regime using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD) to express the cluster operator, without truncating it with respect to the number of excitations. For that purpose, we have proposed a new type of LRTD called ``superpositions of tree-tensor networks'' (STTN), which use the same set of building blocs to define all the tensors involved in the CC equations, and combine different ``channels'', i.e. different types of pairing among excited particles and holes, in the decomposition of a given tensor. Those two principles are aimed at globally minimizing the total number of free parameters required to accurately represent the ground state. In this work, we show that STTN can indeed be compact and accurate representations of strongly correlated ground states by using them to express the CC cluster operator amplitudes and wave function coefficients of exact grounds states of small two-dimensional Hubbard clusters, at half-filling, up to three particle-hole excitations. We show the compactness of STTN by using a number of free parameters smaller than the number of equations in the CCSD approximation, i.e. much smaller than the number of fitted tensor elements. We find that, for the systems considered, the STTN are more accurate as the size of the system increases and that combining different channels in the decompositions of the most strongly correlated tensors is crucial to obtain good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Topological versus conventional superconductivity in a Weyl semimetal: A microscopic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic model for the particle-particle interactions in a Weyl semimetal, we analyzed the possibility for conventional as well as monopole Cooper pairing between quasiparticle excitations at the same (intra-nodal) or opposite (inter-nodal) Weyl nodes. We derived a coupled system of self-consistent BCS-like equations, where the angular dependence of the pairings is directly determined from the microscopic interaction symmetries. We studied the competition between conventional and monopole superconducting phases, thus obtaining explicitly the phase diagrams from the microscopic interaction model parameters. We determined the critical temperatures for both phases, and the low temperature critical behavior, including the specific heat, that we suggest as possible experimental probe for topological quantum criticality in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall-like behavior of multidomain ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a lattice gauge theory using hardware-aware native gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer induced by electronic instabilities in the natural van der Waals hetrostructure 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural van der Waals heterostructure 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ composed of alternating 1T- and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers serves as a platform for investigating the electronic correlations and layer-dependent properties of novel quantum materials. The temperature evolution of the conductivity spectra $\sigma(\omega)$ obtained through infrared spectroscopy elucidates the influence of band modifications associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) superlattice on the 1T layer, resulting in a room-temperature energy gap, $\Delta_{\rm CDW}\approx$ 0.35 eV. However, there is no gap associated to the 1H layer. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we attribute the behavior of interband transitions to the convergence of the layers, which amplifies the charge transfer from the 1T to the 1H layers, progressing as the temperature decreases. This phenomenon leads to an enhanced low-energy spectral weight and carrier density. The presence of an energy gap and the temperature-tunable charge transfer within the bulk of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ driven by layer-dependent CDW states contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of other complex compounds of transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature and spin-one color superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and topological aspects of a spin-one color superconductor. In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ground state is the color-spin locking phase (CSL) with the pairing between quarks of opposite chirality. Li and Haldane show that for generic Cooper pairs formed by Weyl fermions that carry opposite chirality, the gap function must have topologically protected nodes. However, the CSL phase has been known as a fully gapped system and lacks any nodes within one-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We present a general formulation relating the total topological number associated with the nodal structure and the monopole charges of the Berry curvature, including the color structure of the pair quarks. In the CSL phase, the contribution from the chirality, which is assumed to lead to the nodes within the conventional argument, is canceled out by the novel color contribution. Moreover, this non-trivial color Berry structure is manifested through the presence of gapless quasi-particles that exhibit the "color" helicity $\pm 1$, resulting in total monopole charges of $\pm 3/2$ rather than $\pm 1/2$ of a single Weyl fermion.</description>

      <title>A language-inspired machine learning approach for solving strongly correlated problems with dynamical mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SCALINN -- Strongly Correlated Approach with Language Inspired Neural Network -- as a method for solving the Anderson impurity model and reducing the computational cost of dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Inspired by the success of generative Transformer networks in natural language processing, SCALINN utilizes an in-house modified Transformer network in order to learn correlated Matsubara Green's functions, which act as solutions to the impurity model. This is achieved by providing the network with low-cost Matsubara Green's functions, thereby overcoming the computational cost of high accuracy solutions. Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and charge density waves are observed in close vicinity in many strongly correlated materials. Increasing evidence from experiments and numerical simulations suggests both phenomena can also occur in an intertwined manner, where the superconducting order parameter is coupled to the electronic density. Employing density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of such an intertwined state of matter stabilized in the phase diagram of the elementary $t$-$t^\prime$-$U$ Hubbard model in the strong coupling regime. Remarkably, the condensate of Cooper pairs is shown to be fragmented in the presence of a charge density wave where more than one pairing wave function is macroscopically occupied. Moreover, we provide conclusive evidence that the macroscopic wave functions of the superconducting fragments are well-described by soliton solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau equation in a periodic potential constituted by the charge density wave. In the presence of an orbital magnetic field, the order parameters are gauge invariant, and superconducting vortices are pinned between the stripes. This intertwined Ginzburg-Landau theory is proposed as an effective low-energy description of the stripe fragmented superconductor.</description>

      <title>The Crystallographic Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>

Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's in the context of condensed matter physics and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory ofcrystallographic spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering $598$ groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)-irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>A study for the energy structure of the Mott system with a low-energy excitation, in terms of the pseudo-gap in HTSC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the underlying system for high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of under-doped cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1 approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.</description>

      <title>"Quantum Geometric Nesting" and Solvable Model Flat-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Self-organized magnon condensation in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon dynamics in quantum magnetism have long sparked interest in condensed matter physics. Since Bethe's prediction nearly a century ago, multimagnon bound states have presented significant potential for both fundamental insights and technological applications. Despite this, observing these bound states in natural materials has been challenging, partly due to the prevailing view that high magnetic fields are necessary for their stabilization. Here, we demonstrate that low-dimensional spin systems, specifically quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates, offer a promising landscape for realizing multimagnon bound states through a novel stabilization mechanism. This approach leverages small antiferromagnetic interchain couplings that act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting collinear antiferromagnetic order and fostering self-organized magnon condensation at lower field strengths. By circumventing the need for high external fields, this mechanism provides a more experimentally accessible pathway, with implications for developing magnon-based quantum computing architectures, low-power spintronic devices, and high-speed magnonic circuits for efficient information processing. Our study presents a theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data from quasi-one-dimensional cuprates such as Li$_2$CuO$_2$, Ca$_2$Y$_2$Cu$_5$O$_{10}$, LiCuSbO$_4$, and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$. Beyond practical applications, our findings reveal that small interchain couplings can induce previously unobserved magnetic phenomena, offering new insights into the nature of magnetic ordered states.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology ring for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>

      <title>Dipolar ordering transitions in many-body quantum optics: Analytical diagrammatic approach to equilibrium quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interaction partners per spin are frequently used to describe modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However, besides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF ansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and simplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhancement, SPT Absorption, and Duality in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with two Dirac fermions displays time reversal symmetry, nontrivial SPT phases and anomalies. The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher $O(4)$ theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semi-classical limits. A central mechanism behind it is ``SPT absorption''. The patching of the $O(4)$ transitions makes very concrete predictions for the behavior of the theory in its strongly coupled limits; for instance, the $\theta=\pi$ sigma model with $S^3$ topology appears due to monopole condensation.</description>
