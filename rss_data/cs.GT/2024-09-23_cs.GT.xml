      <title>On the Impact of Bounded Rationality in Strategic Data Gathering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimation from survey data gathered from strategic and boundedly-rational agents with heterogeneous objectives and available information. Particularly, we consider a setting where there are three different types of survey responders with varying levels of available information, strategicness, and cognitive hierarchy: i) a non-strategic agent with an honest response, ii) a strategic agent that believes everyone else is a non-strategic agent and that the decoder also believes the same, hence assumes a naive estimator, i.e., level-1 in cognitive hierarchy, iii) and strategic agent that believes the population is Poisson distributed over the previous types, and that the decoder believes the same. We model each of these scenarios as a strategic classification of a 2-dimensional source (possibly correlated source and bias components) with quadratic distortion measures and provide a design algorithm. Finally, we provide our numerical results and the code to obtain them for research purposes at https://github.com/strategic-quantization/bounded-rationality.</description>

      <title>A maximin based, linear programming approach to worst-case scenario control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-zero-sum games, playing maximin or minimax strategies are not optimal in general, and thus we usually do not calculate them. However, under some conditions, such as incomplete information, trembling hands, or an irrational opponent, it can be reasonable to use the maximin expected utility preferences instead. A particular goal when there is uncertainty about an opponents behaviour -- especially when we cannot be certain of their rationality -- is for a player to avoid an unaffordable worst-case payoff. And such a worst-case payoff a player is willing to accept in practice need not be the exact maximin value. Here, we first introduce a motivating example and give the analytical description of an algorithm to control the worst-case scenario given a specified worst-case allowance for two-by-two games. Then we extend this method to n-by-m games using linear programming. We analyze two practical applications from the maximin angle, and also show that the equilibria when facing a malicious opponent coincides with a subset of the Nash equilibria of a transformation of the game. Lastly, we make some comments about problems when trying to analytically compute the subset of a strategy space with a specified worst-case allowance.</description>

      <title>Rent Division with Picky Roommates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can one assign roommates and rooms when tenants have preferences for both where and with whom they live? In this setting, the usual notions of envy-freeness and maximizing social welfare may not hold; the roommate rent-division problem is assumed to be NP-hard, and even when welfare is maximized, an envy-free price vector may not exist. We first construct a novel greedy algorithm with bipartite matching before exploiting the connection between social welfare maximization and the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem to construct a polynomial-time algorithm that gives a $\frac{3}{4}+\varepsilon$-approximation of maximum social welfare. Further, we present an integer program to find a room envy-free price vector that minimizes envy between any two tenants. We show empirically that a MWIS algorithm returns the optimal allocation in polynomial time and conjecture that this problem, at the forefront of computer science research, may have an exact polynomial algorithm solution. This study not only advances the theoretical framework for roommate rent division but also offers practical algorithmic solutions that can be implemented in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Completeness of coalition logics with seriality, independence of agents, or determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In a recent paper, Li and Ju argued that generally, models of Coalition Logic, concurrent game models, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented a Minimal Coalition Logic based on general concurrent game models, which do not have the three assumptions. However, when constructing coalition logics about strategic reasoning in special kinds of situations, we may want to keep some of the assumptions. Thus, studying coalition logics with some of these assumptions makes good sense. In this paper, we show the completeness of these coalition logics by a uniform approach.</description>

      <title>Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In participatory budgeting (PB), voters decide through voting which subset of projects to fund within a given budget. Proportionality in the context of PB is crucial to ensure equal treatment of all groups of voters. However, pure proportional rules can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes. We introduce the Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending (BOS Equal Shares), a robust variant of Equal Shares that balances proportionality and efficiency. BOS Equal Shares addresses inefficiencies inherent in strict proportionality guarantees yet still provides good proportionality similar to the original Method of Equal Shares. In the course of the analysis, we also discuss a fractional variant of the method which allows for partial funding of projects.</description>

      <title>A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</description>

      <title>Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>MEGA-PT: A Meta-Game Framework for Agile Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Penetration testing is an essential means of proactive defense in the face of escalating cybersecurity incidents. Traditional manual penetration testing methods are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to human errors. Current trends in automated penetration testing are also impractical, facing significant challenges such as the curse of dimensionality, scalability issues, and lack of adaptability to network changes. To address these issues, we propose MEGA-PT, a meta-game penetration testing framework, featuring micro tactic games for node-level local interactions and a macro strategy process for network-wide attack chains. The micro- and macro-level modeling enables distributed, adaptive, collaborative, and fast penetration testing. MEGA-PT offers agile solutions for various security schemes, including optimal local penetration plans, purple teaming solutions, and risk assessment, providing fundamental principles to guide future automated penetration testing. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and agility of our model by providing improved defense strategies and adaptability to changes at both local and network levels.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance External Validity Index for Clustering with a Large Number of Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Stable Matching Based Pairing (SMBP) algorithm, a high-performance external validity index for clustering evaluation in large-scale datasets with a large number of clusters. SMBP leverages the stable matching framework to pair clusters across different clustering methods, significantly reducing computational complexity to $O(N^2)$, compared to traditional Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) with $O(N^3)$ complexity. Through comprehensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets, SMBP demonstrates comparable accuracy to MWM and superior computational efficiency. It is particularly effective for balanced, unbalanced, and large-scale datasets with a large number of clusters, making it a scalable and practical solution for modern clustering tasks. Additionally, SMBP is easily implementable within machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, offering a robust tool for big data applications. The algorithm is validated through extensive experiments, showcasing its potential as a powerful alternative to existing methods such as Maximum Match Measure (MMM) and Centroid Ratio (CR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a recommender system based on the Random Utility Model. Online shoppers are modeled as rational decision makers with limited information, and the recommendation task is formulated as the problem of optimally enriching the shopper's awareness set. Notably, the price information and the shopper's Willingness-To-Pay play crucial roles. Furthermore, to better account for the commercial nature of the recommendation, we unify the retailer and shoppers' contradictory objectives into a single welfare metric, which we propose as a new recommendation goal. We test our framework on synthetic data and show its performance in a wide range of scenarios. This new framework, that was absent from the Recommender System literature, opens the door to Welfare-Optimized Recommender Systems, couponing, and price optimization.</description>

      <title>Congestion Pricing for Efficiency and Equity: Theory and Applications to the San Francisco Bay Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Congestion pricing, while adopted by many cities to alleviate traffic congestion, raises concerns about widening socioeconomic disparities due to its disproportionate impact on low-income travelers. We address this concern by proposing a new class of congestion pricing schemes that not only minimize total travel time, but also incorporate an equity objective, reducing disparities in the relative change in travel costs across populations with different incomes, following the implementation of tolls. Our analysis builds on a congestion game model with heterogeneous traveler populations. We present four pricing schemes that account for practical considerations, such as the ability to charge differentiated tolls to various traveler populations and the option to toll all or only a subset of edges in the network. We evaluate our pricing schemes in the calibrated freeway network of the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate that the proposed congestion pricing schemes improve both the total travel time and the equity objective compared to the current pricing scheme.
  Our results further show that pricing schemes charging differentiated prices to traveler populations with varying value-of-time lead to a more equitable distribution of travel costs compared to those that charge a homogeneous price to all.</description>

      <title>Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00399v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses complexity problems in rational verification and synthesis for multi-player games played on weighted graphs, where the objective of each player is to minimize the cost of reaching a specific set of target vertices. In these games, one player, referred to as the system, declares his strategy upfront. The other players, composing the environment, then rationally make their moves according to their objectives. The rational behavior of these responding players is captured through two models: they opt for strategies that either represent a Nash equilibrium or lead to a play with a Pareto-optimal cost tuple.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preference Elicitation in Iterative Combinatorial Auctions with Many Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of achieving high efficiency in iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). ICAs are a kind of combinatorial auction where the auctioneer interacts with bidders to gather their valuation information using a limited number of queries, aiming for efficient allocation. Preference elicitation, a process that incrementally asks bidders to value bundles while refining the outcome allocation, is a commonly used technique in ICAs. Recently, the integration of machine learning (ML) into ICAs has significantly improved preference elicitation. This approach employs ML models that match the number of bidders, estimating each bidder's valuation functions based on their reported valuations. However, most current studies train a separate model for each bidder, which can be inefficient when there are numerous bidders with similar valuation functions and a limited number of available queries. In this study, we introduce a multi-task learning method to learn valuation functions more efficiently. Specifically, we propose to share model parameters during training to grasp the intrinsic relationships between valuations. We assess the performance of our method using a spectrum auction simulator. The findings demonstrate that our method achieves higher efficiency than existing methods, especially in scenarios with many bidders and items but a limited number of queries.</description>

      <title>On Network Congestion Reduction Using Public Signals Under Boundedly Rational User Equilibria (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundedly Rational User Equilibria (BRUE) capture situations where all agents on a transportation network are electing the fastest option up to some time indifference, and serve as a relaxation of User Equilibria (UE), where each agent exactly minimizes their travel time. We study how the social cost under BRUE departs from that of UE in the context of static demand and stochastic costs, along with the implications of BRUE on the optimal signaling scheme of a benevolent central planner. We show that the average excess time is sublinear in the maximum time indifference of the agents, though such aggregate may hide disparity between populations and the sublinearity constant depends on the topology of the network. Regarding the design of public signals, even though in the limit where agents are totally indifferent, it is optimal to not reveal any information, there is in general no trend in how much information is optimally disclosed to agents. What is more, an increase in information disclosed may either harm or benefit agents as a whole.</description>
