      <title>Equivariant Floer homology is isomorphic to reduced Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a symplectic manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian $G$-action and two $G$-invariant Lagrangians, we lift the construction of equivariant Lagrangian Floer homology of G.\@~Cazassus to the Novikov ring by constructing a ``quantum'' model in the vein of Biran and Cornea and Schm\"aschke. Using this refinement, we prove Cazassus' conjecture that, if the action on the zero-level of the moment map is free, then equivariant Floer homology agrees with the Floer homology of the Marsden-Weinstein reduction.</description>

      <title>Maximal Weinstein neighborhoods of symmetric R-spaces and their symplectic capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric R-spaces can be characterized as real forms of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and as such, they are all embedded as Lagrangian submanifolds. We show that their maximal Weinstein tubular neighborhoods are dense and use this property to compute both the Gromov width and the Hofer--Zehnder capacity of the corresponding disc (co)tangent bundles of the symmetric R-spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the isomorphism between the moduli space of certain parabolic Higgs bundles over an elliptic curve and the Hilbert scheme of n points of the cotangent bundle of the elliptic curve is a symplectomorphism with respect to their natural symplectic structures.</description>

      <title>Filtered Topology and Persistence in Stable Homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a category of filtered topological spaces and explore some of its homotopy theoretic properties, including a filtered analogue of CW approximation. With this, we define and study a filtered (weighted) variant of the Euler characteristic and show this is a `filtered homotopy invariant'. We then go on to use the recent work of Biran, Cornea and Zhang by considering a persistence Spanier-Whitehead category of filtered CW complexes and show this is a triangulated persistence category and discuss the fragmentation metrics induced by this structure. We go on to show that the K-group of this persistence category is isomorphic to the ring of Novikov polynomials and this isomorphism is induced by the weighted Euler characteristic. Finally, we discuss how these constructions extend to a filtered stable homotopy category and its relation to filtered/persistence homologies.</description>

      <title>K-contact manifolds with minimal closed Reeb orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. If the symplectic base manifold of the fibration admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that on the total space of the fibration, other than the regular K-contact structures which have infinitely many closed Reeb orbits, there are K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian torus action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, and Lie monoid actions in Morse and Floer theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>Construction of symplectic flexible links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any smooth one-dimensional link in the real projective three-plane is the fixed-point locus of a smooth symplectic surface in the complex projective three-plane which is invariant under complex conjugation. The degree of the surface can be taken to be either one or two, depending on the homology class of the link. In other words, there are no obstructions to finding a symplectic representative of a flexible link beyond the classical topology.</description>
