      <title>Statistical Error of Numerical Integrators for Underdamped Langevin Dynamics with Deterministic And Stochastic Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel discrete Poisson equation approach to estimate the statistical error of a broad class of numerical integrators for the underdamped Langevin dynamics. The statistical error refers to the mean square error of the estimator to the exact ensemble average with a finite number of iterations. With the proposed error analysis framework, we show that when the potential function $U(x)$ is strongly convex in $\mathbb R^d$ and the numerical integrator has strong order $p$, the statistical error is $O(h^{2p}+\frac1{Nh})$, where $h$ is the time step and $N$ is the number of iterations. Besides, this approach can be adopted to analyze integrators with stochastic gradients, and quantitative estimates can be derived as well. Our approach only requires the geometric ergodicity of the continuous-time underdamped Langevin dynamics, and relaxes the constraint on the time step.</description>

      <title>An Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Method for an Interface Model of Flow in Fractured Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete fracture models with reduced-dimensional treatment of conductive and blocking fractures are widely used to simulate fluid flow in fractured porous media. Among these, numerical methods based on interface models are intensively studied, where the fractures are treated as co-dimension one manifolds in a bulk matrix with low-dimensional governing equations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective treatment for modeling the fractures on fitted grids in the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) methods without introducing any additional degrees of freedom or equations on the interfaces. We conduct stability and {\em hp}-analysis for the proposed IPDG method, deriving optimal a priori error bounds concerning mesh size ($h$) and sub-optimal bounds for polynomial degree ($k$) in both the energy norm and the $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments involving published benchmarks validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the method's robust performance. Furthermore, we extend our method to two-phase flows and use numerical tests to confirm the algorithm's validity.</description>

      <title>High-Order Synchrosqueezed Chirplet Transforms for Multicomponent Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the analysis of signals containing multiple components with crossover instantaneous frequencies (IF). This problem was initially solved with the chirplet transform (CT). Also, it can be sharpened by adding the synchrosqueezing step, which is called the synchrosqueezed chirplet transform (SCT). However, we found that the SCT goes wrong with the high chirp modulation signal due to the wrong estimation of the IF. In this paper, we present the improvement of the post-transformation of the CT. The main goal of this paper is to amend the estimation introduced in the SCT and carry out the high-order synchrosqueezed chirplet transform. The proposed method reduces the wrong estimation when facing a stronger variety of chirp-modulated multi-component signals. The theoretical analysis of the new reassignment ingredient is provided. Numerical experiments on some synthetic signals are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed high-order SCT.</description>

      <title>Graph $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs as saddle points of a family of spectral energy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of computing the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs for $p\in (2,\infty)$. We propose a reformulation of the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem in terms of a constrained weighted Laplacian eigenvalue problem and discuss theoretical and computational advantages. We provide a correspondence between $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs and linear eigenpair of a constrained generalized weighted Laplacian eigenvalue problem. As a result, we can assign an index to any $p$-Laplacian eigenpair that matches the Morse index of the $p$-Rayleigh quotient evaluated at the eigenfunction. In the second part of the paper we introduce a class of spectral energy functions that depend on edge and node weights. We prove that differentiable saddle points of the $k$-th energy function correspond to $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs having index equal to $k$. Moreover, the first energy function is proved to possess a unique saddle point which corresponds to the unique first $p$-Laplacian eigenpair. Finally we develop novel gradient-based numerical methods suited to compute $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs for any $p\in(2,\infty)$ and present some experiments.</description>

      <title>An enhanced basis for producing Bezier-like curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims on proposing a new structure for constructing Bernstein-like bases. The structure uses an auxiliary function and a shape parameter to construct a new family of bases from any family of blending functions. The new family of bases inherit almost all algebraic and geometric properties of the initial blending functions. The corresponding curves have the freedom to travel from the curve constructed from the initial blending functions to the line segment joining the first and last control points. The new bases have the monotonicity preservation property and the shape of the curve could be adjusted by changing the parameter.</description>

      <title>Reduced Krylov Basis Methods for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is on a user-friendly reduced basis method for solving a family of parametric PDEs by preconditioned Krylov subspace methods including the conjugate gradient method, generalized minimum residual method, and bi-conjugate gradient method. The proposed methods use a preconditioned Krylov subspace method for a high-fidelity discretization of one parameter instance to generate orthogonal basis vectors of the reduced basis subspace. Then large-scale discrete parameter-dependent problems are approximately solved in the low-dimensional Krylov subspace. As shown in the theory and experiments, only a small number of Krylov subspace iterations are needed to simultaneously generate approximate solutions of a family of high-fidelity and large-scale systems in the reduced basis subspace. This reduces the computational cost dramatically because (1) to construct the reduced basis vectors, we only solve one large-scale problem in the high-fidelity level; and (2) the family of large-scale problems restricted to the reduced basis subspace have much smaller sizes.</description>

      <title>Randomized algorithms for computing the tensor train approximation and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the fixed TT-rank and precision problems of finding an approximation of the tensor train (TT) decomposition of a tensor. Note that the TT-SVD and TT-cross are two well-known algorithms for these two problems. Firstly, by combining the random projection technique with the power scheme, we obtain two types of randomized algorithms for the fixed TT-rank problem. Secondly, by using the non-asymptotic theory of sub-random Gaussian matrices, we derive the upper bounds of the proposed randomized algorithms. Thirdly, we deduce a new deterministic strategy to estimate the desired TT-rank with a given tolerance and another adaptive randomized algorithm that finds a low TT-rank representation satisfying a given tolerance, and is beneficial when the target TT-rank is not known in advance. We finally illustrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms via some test tensors from synthetic and real databases. In particular, for the fixed TT-rank problem, the proposed algorithms can be several times faster than the TT-SVD, and the accuracy of the proposed algorithms and the TT-SVD are comparable for several test tensors.</description>

      <title>A complete pair of solvents of a quadratic matrix pencil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ and $C$ be square complex matrices. The differential equation \begin{equation*} x''(t)+Bx'(t)+Cx(t)=f(t) \end{equation*} is considered. A solvent is a matrix solution $X$ of the equation $X^2+BX+C=\mathbf0$. A pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ is called complete if the matrix $X-Z$ is invertible. Knowing a complete pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ allows us to reduce the solution of the initial value problem to the calculation of two matrix exponentials $e^{Xt}$ and $e^{Zt}$. The problem of finding a complete pair $X$ and $Z$, which leads to small rounding errors in solving the differential equation, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Extreme Distance Distributions of Poisson Voronoi Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson point processes provide a versatile framework for modeling the distributions of random points in space. When the space is partitioned into cells, each associated with a single generating point from the Poisson process, there appears a geometric structure known as Poisson Voronoi tessellation. These tessellations find applications in various fields such as biology, material science, and communications, where the statistical properties of the Voronoi cells reveal patterns and structures that hold key insights into the underlying processes generating the observed phenomena.
  In this paper, we investigate a distance measure of Poisson Voronoi tessellations that is emerging in the literature, yet for which its statistical and geometrical properties remain explored only in the asymptotic case when the density of seed points approaches infinity. Our work, specifically focused on homogeneous Poisson point processes, characterizes the cumulative distribution functions governing the smallest and largest distances between the points generating the Voronoi regions and their respective vertices for an arbitrary density of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For that, we conduct a Monte-Carlo type simulation with $10^8$ Voronoi cells and fit the resulting empirical cumulative distribution functions to the Generalized Gamma, Gamma, Log-normal, Rayleigh, and Weibull distributions. Our analysis compares these fits in terms of root mean-squared error and maximum absolute variation, revealing the Generalized Gamma distribution as the best-fit model for characterizing these distances in homogeneous Poisson Voronoi tessellations. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the maximum likelihood and the $95$\% confidence interval of the parameters of the Generalized Gamma distribution along with the algorithm implemented to calculate the maximum and minimum distances.</description>

      <title>An Unstructured Body-of-Revolution Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Algorithm with Radial Perfectly Matched Layers and Dual Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel electromagnetic particle-in-cell algorithm has been developed for fully kinetic plasma simulations on unstructured (irregular) meshes in complex body-of-revolution geometries. The algorithm, implemented in the BORPIC++ code, utilizes a set of field scalings and a coordinate mapping, reducing the Maxwell field problem in a cylindrical system to a Cartesian finite element Maxwell solver in the meridian plane. The latter obviates the cylindrical coordinate singularity in the symmetry axis. The choice of an unstructured finite element discretization enhances the geometrical flexibility of the BORPIC++ solver compared to the more traditional finite difference solvers. Symmetries in Maxwell's equations are explored to decompose the problem into two dual polarization states with isomorphic representations that enable code reuse. The particle-in-cell scatter and gather steps preserve charge-conservation at the discrete level. Our previous algorithm (BORPIC+) discretized the E and B field components of TE-phi and TM-phi polarizations on the finite element (primal) mesh. A cylindrical perfectly matched layer is implemented as a boundary condition in the radial direction to simulate open space problems, with periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. We investigate effects of charged particles moving next to the cylindrical perfectly matched layer. We model azimuthal currents arising from rotational motion of charged rings, which produce TM-phi polarized fields. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the first application of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive optimal experimental design for large-scale nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems using a Bayesian approximation error approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for nonlinear inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. Optimizing the data acquisition process for large-scale nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems is a computationally challenging task since the posterior is typically intractable and commonly-encountered optimality criteria depend on the observed data. Since these challenges are not present in OED for linear Bayesian inverse problems, we propose an approach based on first linearizing the associated forward problem and then optimizing the experimental design. Replacing an accurate but costly model with some linear surrogate, while justified for certain problems, can lead to incorrect posteriors and sub-optimal designs if model discrepancy is ignored. To avoid this, we use the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach to formulate an A-optimal design objective for sensor selection that is aware of the model error. In line with recent developments, we prove that this uncertainty-aware objective is independent of the exact choice of linearization. This key observation facilitates the formulation of an uncertainty-aware OED objective function using a completely trivial linear map, the zero map, as a surrogate to the forward dynamics. The base methodology is also extended to marginalized OED problems, accommodating uncertainties arising from both linear approximations and unknown auxiliary parameters. Our approach only requires parameter and data sample pairs, hence it is particularly well-suited for black box forward models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for finding optimal designs in an idealized subsurface flow inverse problem and for tsunami detection.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Rounding Error Analysis From A Statistical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional probabilistic rounding error analysis in numerical linear algebra provides worst-case bounds with an associated failure probability, which can still be pessimistic. In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic rounding error analysis from a statistical perspective. By assuming both the data and the relative error are independent random variables, we derive the approximate closed-form expressions for the expectation and variance of the rounding errors in various key computational kernels. Our analytical expressions have three notable characteristics: they are statistical and do not involve a failure probability; they are sharper than other deterministic and probabilistic bounds, using mean square error as the metric; they are correct to all orders of unit roundoff and valid for any dimension. Furthermore, numerical experiments validate the accuracy of our derivations and demonstrate that our analytical expressions are generally at least two orders of magnitude tighter than alternative worst-case bounds, exemplified through the inner products. We also discuss a scenario involving inner products where the underlying assumptions are invalid, i.e., input data are dependent, rendering the analytical expressions inapplicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the inverse dynamic source problem arising from the time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). We recover the dynamic distributions of fluorophores in biological tissue by the one single boundary measurement in finite time domain. We build the uniqueness theorem of this inverse problem. After that, we introduce a weighted norm and establish the conditional stability of Lipschitz type for the inverse problem by this weighted norm. The numerical inversions are considered under the framework of the deep neural networks (DNNs). We establish the generalization error estimates rigorously derived from Lipschitz conditional stability of inverse problem. Finally, we propose the reconstruction algorithms and give several numerical examples illustrating the performance of the proposed inversion schemes.</description>

      <title>New Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind Schemes. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-dissipation central-upwind (LDCU) schemes have been recently introduced in [A. Kurganov and R. Xin, J. Sci. Comput., 96 (2023), Paper No. 56] as a modification of the central-upwind (CU) schemes from [{\sc A. Kurganov and C. T. Lin, Commun. Comput. Phys., 2 (2007), pp. 141-163}]. The LDCU schemes achieve much higher resolution of contact waves and many (two-dimensional) structures resulting from complicated wave interaction. However, the LDCU schemes sometimes produce more oscillatory results compared with the CU schemes, especially near the computational domain boundaries.
  In this paper, we propose a very simple -- yet systematic -- modification of the LDCU schemes, which completely eliminates the aforementioned oscillations almost without affecting the quality of the computed solution.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of three semi-discrete numerical schemes for nonlocal geometric flows including perimeter terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze three distinct semi-discrete schemes for solving nonlocal geometric flows incorporating perimeter terms. These schemes are based on the finite difference method, the finite element method, and the finite element method with a specific tangential motion. We offer rigorous proofs of quadratic convergence under $H^1$-norm for the first scheme and linear convergence under $H^1$-norm for the latter two schemes. All error estimates rely on the observation that the error of the nonlocal term can be controlled by the error of the local term. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the convergence under $L^\infty$-norm and manifold distance. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the convergence analysis, and demonstrate the accuracy of our schemes under various norms for different types of nonlocal flows.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic stability of asymmetric Hermite basis and application to plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze why the discretization of linear transport with asymmetric Hermite basis functions can be instable in quadratic norm. The main reason is that the finite truncation of the infinite moment linear system looses the skew-symmetry property with respect to the Gram matrix. Then we propose an original closed formula for the scalar product of any pair of asymmetric basis functions. It makes possible the construction of two simple modifications of the linear systems which recover the skew-symmetry property. By construction the new methods are quadratically stable with respect to the natural $L^2$ norm. We explain how to generalize to other transport equations encountered in numerical plasma physics. Basic numerical tests illustrate the unconditional stability properties of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal accuracy for linear sets of equations with the graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain Graph Laplacian linear sets of equations exhibit optimal accuracy, guaranteeing that the relative error is no larger than the norm of the relative residual and that optimality occurs for carefully chosen right-hand sides. Such sets of equations arise in PageRank and Markov chain theory. We establish new relationships among the PageRank teleportation parameter, the Markov chain discount, and approximations to linear sets of equations. The set of optimally accurate systems can be separated into two groups for an undirected graph -- those that achieve optimality asymptotically with the graph size and those that do not -- determined by the angle between the right-hand side of the linear system and the vector of all ones. We provide supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral parameter power series (SPPS) representation for the regular solution of the radial Dirac system with complex coefficients is obtained, as well as a SPPS representation for the (entire) characteristic function of the corresponding spectral problem on a finite interval. Based on the SPPS representation, a numerical method for solving spectral problems is developed. It is shown that the method is also applicable to solving spectral problems for perturbed Bessel equations. We exhibit that the proposed numerical method delivers excellent results. Additionally, an application of the method to find the energy values of hydrogen-like atoms with a finite radius is presented.</description>

      <title>Method of Successive Approximations for Stochastic Optimal Control: Contractivity and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) is a fixed-point iterative method used to solve stochastic optimal control problems. It is an indirect method based on the conditions derived from the Stochastic Maximum Principle (SMP), an extension of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to stochastic control problems. In this study, we investigate the contractivity and the convergence of MSA for a specific and interesting class of stochastic dynamical systems (when the drift coefficient is one-sided-Lipschitz with a negative constant and the diffusion coefficient is Lipschitz continuous). Our analysis unfolds in three key steps: firstly, we prove the stability of the state process with respect to the control process. Secondly, we establish the stability of the adjoint process. Finally, we present rigorous evidence to prove the contractivity and then the convergence of MSA. This study contributes to enhancing the understanding of MSA's applicability and effectiveness in addressing stochastic optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Patterns and Chaos Control in Discrete-Time Coral Reef Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction in coral reef densities, characterized by the proliferation of macroalgae, has emerged as a global threat. In this paper, we present a discrete-time coral reef dynamical model that incorporates macroalgae. We explore all ecologically possible equilibrium points for the proposed model. The conditions for the local stability of the interior equilibrium point are analyzed, which represents the coexistence of both coral and macroalgae. Furthermore, we investigate the model's behavior using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory. Our analysis reveals that the model undergoes codimension-one bifurcations, specifically period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. To address the chaos resulting from the emergence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, we apply the OGY feedback control method and a hybrid control methodology. Finally, we provide numerical simulations not only to validate the obtained results but also to demonstrate the complex dynamic behaviors that arise. These behaviors include reversal period-doubling bifurcation, period-4, 8, and 24 bubble bifurcations, as well as chaotic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of charged particles in a graph can be modeled using random walks on a weighted graph. We give strategies to hide (or cloak) changes in a subgraph from the perspective of measurements of expected net particle charges made at nodes away from the cloaked subgraph. We distinguish between passive and active strategies, depending on whether the strategy involves injecting particles. The passive strategy can hide topology and edge weight changes. In addition to these capabilities, the active strategy can also hide sources of particles, at the cost of prior knowledge of the expected net particle charges in the reference graph. The strategies we present rely on discrete analogues of classic potential theory, that include a Calder\'on calculus on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores variants of the subspace iteration algorithm for computing approximate invariant subspaces. The standard subspace iteration approach is revisited and new variants that exploit gradient-type techniques combined with a Grassmann manifold viewpoint are developed. A gradient method as well as a nonlinear conjugate gradient technique are described. Convergence of the gradient-based algorithm is analyzed and a few numerical experiments are reported, indicating that the proposed algorithms are sometimes superior to standard algorithms. This includes the Chebyshev-based subspace iteration and the locally optimal block conjugate gradient method, when compared in terms of number of matrix vector products and computational time, resp. The new methods, on the other hand, do not require estimating optimal parameters. An important contribution of this paper to achieve this good performance is the accurate and efficient implementation of an exact line search. In addition, new convergence proofs are presented for the non-accelerated gradient method that includes a locally exponential convergence if started in a $\mathcal{O(\sqrt{\delta})}$ neighbourhood of the dominant subspace with spectral gap $\delta$.</description>

Abstract: This note shows how to compute, to high relative accuracy under mild assumptions, complex Jacobi rotations for diagonalization of Hermitian matrices of order two, using the correctly rounded functions $\mathtt{cr\_hypot}$ and $\mathtt{cr\_rsqrt}$, proposed for standardization in the C programming language as recommended by the IEEE-754 floating-point standard. The rounding to nearest (ties to even) and the non-stop arithmetic are assumed. The numerical examples compare the observed with theoretical bounds on the relative errors in the rotations' elements, and show that the maximal observed departure of the rotations' determinants from unity is smaller than that of the transformations computed by LAPACK.</description>

In our numerical scheme, we employ an implicit Crank-Nicolson method for time discretization and a conforming FE method for spatial discretization. The proposed method is proved to be well-posedness and ensures mass and energy conservation at the discrete level. Furthermore, we prove optimal $L^2$ error estimates for the fully discrete solutions. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to verify the convergence rate and conservation properties.</description>

Abstract: We propose an efficient semi-Lagrangian characteristic mapping method for solving the one+one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations with high precision on a coarse grid. The flow map is evolved numerically and exponential resolution in linear time is obtained. Global third-order convergence in space and time is shown and conservation properties are assessed. For benchmarking, we consider linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the two-stream instability. We compare the results with a Fourier pseudo-spectral method. The extreme fine-scale resolution features are illustrated showing the method's capabilities to efficiently treat filamentation in fusion plasma simulations.</description>

      <title>A Meshless Solver for Blood Flow Simulations in Elastic Vessels Using Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating blood flow in the cardiovascular system is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational approaches offer some non-invasive alternatives to measure blood flow dynamics. Numerical simulations based on traditional methods such as finite-element and other numerical discretizations have been extensively studied and have yielded excellent results. However, adapting these methods to real-life simulations remains a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method that offers flexibility and can efficiently handle real-life simulations. We suggest utilizing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a deformable domain, specifically addressing the simulation of blood flow in elastic vessels. Our approach models blood flow using an incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form. The mechanical model for the vessel wall structure is formulated by an equation of Newton's second law of momentum and linear elasticity to the force exerted by the fluid flow. Our method is a mesh-free approach that eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of the computational domain. This makes it highly efficient in solving simulations involving complex geometries. Additionally, with the availability of well-developed open-source machine learning framework packages and parallel modules, our method can easily be accelerated through GPU computing and parallel computing. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on regular cylinder vessels as well as vessels with plaque on their walls. We compared our results to a solution calculated by Finite Element Methods using a dense grid and small time steps, which we considered as the ground truth solution. We report the relative error and the time consumed to solve the problem, highlighting the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Approximating Numerical Fluxes Using Fourier Neural Operators for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01783v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, classical numerical schemes have been employed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) using computational methods. Recently, neural network-based methods have emerged. Despite these advancements, neural network-based methods, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, exhibit deficiencies in robustness and generalization. To address these issues, numerous studies have integrated classical numerical frameworks with machine learning techniques, incorporating neural networks into parts of traditional numerical methods. In this study, we focus on hyperbolic conservation laws by replacing traditional numerical fluxes with neural operators. To this end, we developed loss functions inspired by established numerical schemes related to conservation laws and approximated numerical fluxes using Fourier neural operators (FNOs). Our experiments demonstrated that our approach combines the strengths of both traditional numerical schemes and FNOs, outperforming standard FNO methods in several respects. For instance, we demonstrate that our method is robust, has resolution invariance, and is feasible as a data-driven method. In particular, our method can make continuous predictions over time and exhibits superior generalization capabilities with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which are challenges that existing neural operator methods encounter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian sampling is an important task in statistics and machine learning. Over the past decade, many ensemble-type sampling methods have been proposed. In contrast to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, these new methods deploy a large number of interactive samples, and the communication between these samples is crucial in speeding up the convergence. To justify the validity of these sampling strategies, the concept of interacting particles naturally calls for the mean-field theory. The theory establishes a correspondence between particle interactions encoded in a set of coupled ODEs/SDEs and a PDE that characterizes the evolution of the underlying distribution. This bridges numerical algorithms with the PDE theory used to show convergence in time. Many mathematical machineries are developed to provide the mean-field analysis, and we showcase two such examples: The coupling method and the compactness argument built upon the martingale strategy. The former has been deployed to show the convergence of ensemble Kalman sampler and ensemble Kalman inversion, and the latter will be shown to be immensely powerful in proving the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of evolution equations by nonlinear parametrizations $u(t)=\Phi(q(t))$ with time-dependent parameters $q(t)$, which are to be determined in the computation. The motivation comes from approximations in quantum dynamics by multiple Gaussians and approximations of various dynamical problems by tensor networks and neural networks. In all these cases, the parametrization is typically irregular: the derivative $\Phi'(q)$ can have arbitrarily small singular values and may have varying rank. We derive approximation results for a regularized approach in the time-continuous case as well as in time-discretized cases. With a suitable choice of the regularization parameter and the time stepsize, the approach can be successfully applied in irregular situations, even though it runs counter to the basic principle in numerical analysis to avoid solving ill-posed subproblems when aiming for a stable algorithm. Numerical experiments with sums of Gaussians for approximating quantum dynamics and with neural networks for approximating the flow map of a system of ordinary differential equations illustrate and complement the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: Variable-exponent fractional models attract increasing attentions in various applications, while the rigorous analysis is far from well developed. This work provides general tools to address these models. Specifically, we first develop a convolution method to study the well-posedness, regularity, an inverse problem and numerical approximation for the sundiffusion of variable exponent. For models such as the variable-exponent two-sided space-fractional boundary value problem (including the variable-exponent fractional Laplacian equation as a special case) and the distributed variable-exponent model, for which the convolution method does not apply, we develop a perturbation method to prove their well-posedness. The relation between the convolution method and the perturbation method is discussed, and we further apply the latter to prove the well-posedness of the variable-exponent Abel integral equation and discuss the constraint on the data under different initial values of variable exponent.</description>

In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

Abstract: As interest in large language models (LLMs) grows, the importance of accuracy in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has become more pronounced. This is particularly true for lectures that include specialized terminology, where the success rate of traditional ASR models tends to be low, posing a challenging problem. A method to improve ASR performance for specialized terminology using the word frequency difference approach has been proposed. Through experiments and data analysis, we investigate whether this proposal effectively addresses the issue. Additionally, we introduce the power law as the theoretical foundation for the relative frequency</description>

      <title>Improved scalar auxiliary variable schemes for original energy stability of gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) methods are a class of linear schemes for solving gradient flows that are known for the stability of a `modified' energy. In this paper, we propose an improved SAV (iSAV) scheme that not only retains the complete linearity but also ensures rigorously the stability of the original energy. The convergence and optimal error bound are rigorously established for the iSAV scheme and discussions are made for its high-order extension. Extensive numerical experiments are done to validate the convergence, robustness and energy stability of iSAV, and some comparisons are made.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Langevin Differential Inclusions with Applications to Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations of Langevin-diffusion form have received significant attention, thanks to their foundational role in both Bayesian sampling algorithms and optimization in machine learning. In the latter, they serve as a conceptual model of the stochastic gradient flow in training over-parameterized models. However, the literature typically assumes smoothness of the potential, whose gradient is the drift term. Nevertheless, there are many problems for which the potential function is not continuously differentiable, and hence the drift is not Lipschitz continuous everywhere. This is exemplified by robust losses and Rectified Linear Units in regression problems. In this paper, we show some foundational results regarding the flow and asymptotic properties of Langevin-type Stochastic Differential Inclusions under assumptions appropriate to the machine-learning settings. In particular, we show strong existence of the solution, as well as an asymptotic minimization of the canonical free-energy functional.</description>

      <title>Some interesting birational morphisms of smooth affine quadric $3$-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of birational maps of smooth affine quadric 3-folds, {over the complex numbers}, of the form $x_1x_4-x_2x_3=$ constant, which seems to have some (among many others) interesting/unexpected characters: a) they are cohomologically hyperbolic, b) their second dynamical degree is an algebraic number but not an algebraic integer, and c) the logarithmic growth of their periodic points is strictly smaller than their algebraic entropy. These maps are restrictions of a polynomial map on $\mathbb{C}^4$ preserving each of the quadrics. The study in this paper is a mixture of rigorous and experimental ones, where for the experimental study we rely on Bertini which is a reliable and fast software for expensive numerical calculations in complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Second order quantitative bounds for unadjusted generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a convergence analysis for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on leapfrog integration of Hamiltonian dynamics and kinetic Langevin diffusion, that encompasses the unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Assuming that the target distribution $\pi$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and mild conditions on the corresponding potential function, we establish quantitative bounds on the relative entropy of the iterates defined by the algorithm, with respect to $\pi$. Our approach is based on a perturbative and discrete version of the modified entropy method developed to establish hypocoercivity for the continuous-time kinetic Langevin process. As a corollary of our main result, we are able to derive complexity bounds for the class of algorithms at hand. In particular, we show that the total number of iterations to achieve a target accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$ is of order $d/\varepsilon^{1/4}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. This result can be further improved in the case of weakly interacting mean field potentials, for which we find a total number of iterations of order $(d/\varepsilon)^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>Proximal Langevin Sampling With Inexact Proximal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to solve tasks like uncertainty quantification or hypothesis tests in Bayesian imaging inverse problems, we often have to draw samples from the arising posterior distribution. For the usually log-concave but high-dimensional posteriors, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on time discretizations of Langevin diffusion are a popular tool. If the potential defining the distribution is non-smooth, these discretizations are usually of an implicit form leading to Langevin sampling algorithms that require the evaluation of proximal operators. For some of the potentials relevant in imaging problems this is only possible approximately using an iterative scheme. We investigate the behaviour of a proximal Langevin algorithm under the presence of errors in the evaluation of proximal mappings. We generalize existing non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence results of the exact algorithm to our inexact setting and quantify the bias between the target and the algorithm's stationary distribution due to the errors. We show that the additional bias stays bounded for bounded errors and converges to zero for decaying errors in a strongly convex setting. We apply the inexact algorithm to sample numerically from the posterior of typical imaging inverse problems in which we can only approximate the proximal operator by an iterative scheme and validate our theoretical convergence results.</description>

      <title>Covering Number of Real Algebraic Varieties and Beyond: Improved Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covering numbers are a powerful tool used in the development of approximation algorithms, randomized dimension reduction methods, smoothed complexity analysis, and others. In this paper we prove upper bounds on the covering number of numerous sets in Euclidean space, namely real algebraic varieties, images of polynomial maps and semialgebraic sets in terms of the number of variables and degrees of the polynomials involved. The bounds remarkably improve the best known general bound by Yomdin-Comte, and our proof is much more straightforward. In particular, our result gives new bounds on the volume of the tubular neighborhood of the image of a polynomial map and a semialgebraic set, where results for varieties by Lotz and Basu-Lerario are not directly applicable. We illustrate the power of the result on three computational applications. Firstly, we derive a near-optimal bound on the covering number of low rank CP tensors, quantifying their approximation properties and filling in an important missing piece of theory for tensor dimension reduction and reconstruction. Secondly, we prove a bound on the required dimension for the randomized sketching of polynomial optimization problems, which controls how much computation can be saved through randomization without sacrificing solution quality. Finally, we deduce generalization error bounds for deep neural networks with rational or ReLU activation functions, improving or matching the best known results in the machine learning literature while helping to quantify the impact of architecture choice on generalization error.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for Cayley transforms and inverses of semigroup generators via the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $-A$ be the generator of a bounded $C_0$-semigroup $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ on a Hilbert space. First we study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the Cayley transform $V_{\omega}(A) := (A-\omega I) (A+\omega I)^{-1}$ with $\omega &gt;0$. We give a decay estimate for $\|V_{\omega}(A)^nA^{-1}\|$ when $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ is polynomially stable. Considering the case where the parameter $\omega$ varies, we estimate $\|(\prod_{k=1}^n V_{\omega_k}(A))A^{-1}\|$ for exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$. Next we show that if the generator $-A$ of the bounded $C_0$-semigroup has a bounded inverse, then $\sup_{t \geq 0} \|e^{-tA^{-1}} A^{-\alpha} \| &lt; \infty$ for all $\alpha &gt;0$. We also present an estimate for the rate of decay of $\|e^{-tA^{-1}} A^{-1} \|$, assuming that $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ is polynomially stable. To obtain these results, we use operator norm estimates offered by a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus.</description>

      <title>Deeper or Wider: A Perspective from Optimal Generalization Error with Sobolev Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing the architecture of a neural network is a challenging pursuit for the machine learning community, and the dilemma of whether to go deeper or wider remains a persistent question. This paper explores a comparison between deeper neural networks (DeNNs) with a flexible number of layers and wider neural networks (WeNNs) with limited hidden layers, focusing on their optimal generalization error in Sobolev losses. Analytical investigations reveal that the architecture of a neural network can be significantly influenced by various factors, including the number of sample points, parameters within the neural networks, and the regularity of the loss function. Specifically, a higher number of parameters tends to favor WeNNs, while an increased number of sample points and greater regularity in the loss function lean towards the adoption of DeNNs. We ultimately apply this theory to address partial differential equations using deep Ritz and physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods, guiding the design of neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first probabilistic framework tailored for sequential random projection, an approach rooted in the challenges of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The analysis is complicated by the sequential dependence and high-dimensional nature of random variables, a byproduct of the adaptive mechanisms inherent in sequential decision processes. Our work features a novel construction of a stopped process, facilitating the analysis of a sequence of concentration events that are interconnected in a sequential manner. By employing the method of mixtures within a self-normalized process, derived from the stopped process, we achieve a desired non-asymptotic probability bound. This bound represents a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, marking a pioneering contribution to the literature on random projection and sequential analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for partial differential equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established.

Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>
