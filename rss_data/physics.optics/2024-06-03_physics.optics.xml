      <title>In vivo fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase-mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for accommodation or refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the conjugate plane to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point-spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors (up to $\pm $12D). We also show computationally-refocused color in vivo human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase-mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>

      <title>Spatial light mode analogues of generalized quantum coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the spatial degree of freedom of light modes to construct optical analogues of generalized quantum coherent states for Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss modes. Our optical analogues preserve the statistical properties of their quantum counterparts, encoded in their amplitude and phase distributions. We explore three basic symmetries that provide generalized displaced, rotated, and squeezed coherent states. Given the substantial interest in squeezed states for probing matter, we believe that the optical analogues introduced here have significant implications for optical sensing. Specifically, the single-particle nature of our spatial modes makes them robust candidates for sensing photosensitive materials. Overall, our approach opens the door to optical metrology and sensing protocols that mimic those already existing in the quantum realm, and facilitates further exploration of the quantum state zoo through classical optical analogues.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Transmission Matrices of Specialty Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission matrix measurements of multimode fibers are now routinely performed in numerous labs, enabling control of the electric field at the distal end of the fiber and paving the way for the potential application to ultrathin medical endoscopes with high resolution. However, the process of building an experimental setup and developing the supporting code to measure the fiber's transmission matrix remains challenging with full details on experimental design, data collection, and supporting algorithms spread over multiple papers or lacking in detail. Here, we outline a complete and self-contained description of the experiment we use to measure fully polarization-resolved transmission matrices. Our specific implementation of the full polarization experiment is new and is easy to align while providing flexibility to switch between full-polarization and scalar measurements if desired. We introduce a new method to measure and account for the phase and amplitude drift during the measurement using a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting algorithm. Finally, we describe creating distal images through the multimode fiber using phase-to-amplitude shaping techniques to construct the correct input electric field and show that results are insensitive to this choice as quantified by measuring the contrast of a razor blade at the distal end of the fiber. Throughout the paper, we discuss applications of our setup and measurement process to a variety of specialty fibers, including fibers with harsh environment coatings, coreless fibers, rectangular core fibers, pedestal fibers, and a pump-signal combiner based on a tapered fiber bundle.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge fields provide a conceptual framework for the description of particles having spins. The theoretical importance of non-Abelian gauge fields motivates their experimental synthesis and explorations. Here, we demonstrate non-Abelian lattice gauge fields for photons. In the study of gauge fields, lattice models are essential for the understanding of their implications in extended systems. We utilize the platform of synthetic frequency dimensions, which enables the study of lattice physics in a scalable and programmable way. We observe Dirac cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta as well as the direction reversal of eigenstate trajectories associated with such Dirac cones. Both of them are unique signatures of non-Abelian gauge fields in our lattice system. Our results highlight the implications of non-Abelian gauge field in the study of topological physics and suggest opportunities for the control of photon spins and pseudospins.</description>

      <title>Collective modes of nanoparticles levitated in a cavity: mechanical mode combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated nanoparticles are being investigated as ultrasensitive sensors of forces and accelerations, with applications ranging from fundamental physics phenomena such as dark matter or quantum gravity to real world applications. Quantum cooling in up to 2 motional modes was achieved recently, and attention is now turning to multimode and multiparticle regimes. We investigate here the spectral characteristics of collective motion of $\Ntot= 2-20 $ nanoparticle modes interacting via the optical light of a cavity. We find output spectra of collective motion typically exhibit two dominant generic features: a broad spectral feature, the collective bright mode (CBM) as expected; but we introduce also the mechanical mode comb (MC) a -- not previously studied -- spectral feature. We investigate numerically, and can also precisely reproduce all the intricate details of the MC spectra, including ponderomotive squeezing, with a simple closed-form expression. We show the mechanical comb can autonomously repair loss of teeth due to nanoparticle loss, a feature that may offer robustness to a levitated sensor of external forces.</description>

      <title>Realization of type-II double-zero-index photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some photonic crystals (PCs) with Dirac-like conical dispersions exhibit the property of double zero refractive index (that is, both epsilon and mu near zero (EMNZ)), wherein the electromagnetic waves have an infinite effective wavelength and do not experience any spatial phase change. The Dirac-like cones that support EMNZ are previously thought to present only at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\Gamma$ point) with a zero wavevector (we refer to as type-I EMNZ), which is constrained by the proportional relationship between phase refractive index and wavevector ($n=kc/\omega$). Here, we demonstrate the existence of an anomalous type-II EMNZ in PCs, which is associated with the Dirac-like point at off-$\Gamma$ points. By introducing a wave modulation approach, we theoretically elucidate its physical mechanism, and resolve the paradox of type-II EMNZ with non-zero wavevectors. We then fabricate a type-II EMNZ PC operating at the X point, and experimentally demonstrate that both its effective permittivity and permeability are zero at the Dirac-like point. Type-II EMNZ PCs exhibit a range of intriguing phenomena, including angle-selective transmission, wavefront flattening, a 180$^{\circ}$ phase shift upon transmission, and waveguiding with natural zero radiation loss. The extraordinary properties of type-II EMNZ PCs may open new avenues for the development of angle-selective optical filters, directional light sources, phase-controlled optical switches, ultracompact photonic circuits, nanolasers, and on-chip nonlinear enhancement.</description>

      <title>For passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8 - 13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is slightly better: the difference in cooling power is small, at most on the order of ~2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>

      <title>MoS2-based optical bistability in silver-Bragg reflector multilayer structure at visible light band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the optical bistability in a metallic silver-Bragg reflector structure by embedding bilayer MoS2 at the visible band. The nonlinear OB is achieved due to the nonlinear conductivity of the bilayer MoS2 and the excitation of the optical Tamm state at the interface between the silver and the Bragg reflector. It is found that the hysteresis behaviour and the threshold width of the OB can be effectively tuned by varying the incident light wavelength. In addition, the optical bistable behaviour of the structure can be adjusted by varying the position of the MoS2 inset in the defect layer, incident angle and the structural parameters of the spacer layer. Although the current threshold cannot be commercialized, we believe that this solution will provide a meaningful path reference for low threshold bistability in the visible light band.</description>

      <title>Low threshold optical bistability based on MoS2 in asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity structure in visible light band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article theoretically proposes a multi-layer Fabry-Perot cavity structure based on nonlinear MoS2, whose cavity is composed of asymmetric photonic crystals. In this structure, we observed a low threshold optical bistability phenomenon on the order of a in the visible light band, which is caused by the large third-order nonlinear conductivity of the bilayer MoS2 and the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance. Research has found that when light is incident from two different directions in an asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity, the optical bistability exhibits not exactly the same behavior. In addition, we further investigated and found that the optical bistability behavior in this simple multi-layer structure is closely related to parameters such as incident wavelength, Fabry-Perot cavity length, and refractive index of the photonic crystal dielectric. This work provides a new approach for the implementation of low threshold optical bistable devices in the visible light band, which is expected to be applied in nonlinear optical fields such as all optical switches and all optical logic devices.</description>

      <title>Versatile Braiding of Non-Hermitian Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the most intriguing features of non-Hermitian (NH) systems is the capability of their complex energies to form braids under parametric variation. Several braiding behaviors, including link and knot formation, have been observed in experiments on synthetic NH systems such as looped optical fibers. Though the exact conditions for these phenomena remain unsettled, existing demonstrations have involved long-range nonreciprocal hoppings, which are hard to implement on many experimental platforms. Here, we introduce a route to realize complex energy braids using 1D NH Aubry-Andre-Harper lattices. Under purely local gain and loss modulation, the eigenstates exhibit a variety of different braiding behaviors, including unknots, Hopf links, trefoil knots, Solomon links and catenanes. We show how these are created by the interplay between non-Hermiticity and the lattice bulk states and topological edge states. The transitions between different braiding configurations are marked by changes in the global Berry phase of the NH lattice. These findings reveal interesting connections between the braiding of complex energies and NH band topology.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional optical singularities and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical singularities, which are positions within an electromagnetic field where certain field parameters become undefined, hold significant potential for applications in areas such as super-resolution microscopy, sensing, and communication. This potential stems from their high field confinement and characteristic rapidly-changing field distributions. Although the systematic characterization of the first singularities dates back many decades, recent advancements in sub-wavelength wavefront control at optical frequencies have led to a renewed interest in the field, and have substantially expanded the range of known optical singularities and singular structures. However, the diversity in descriptions, mathematical formulations, and naming conventions can create confusion and impede accessibility to the field. This review aims to clarify the nomenclature by demonstrating that any singular field can be conceptualized as a collection of a finite set of principal, 'generic' singularities. These singularities are robust against small perturbations due to their topological nature. We underscore that the control over the principal properties of those singularities, namely, their protection against perturbations and their dimension, utilizes a consistent mathematical framework. Additionally, we provide an overview of current design techniques for both stable and approximate singularities and discuss their applications across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Field Distribution and Divergence-Dependence of a Radially Polarized Gaussian Vector Beam Focused by a Parabolic Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derived formulae concerning the electric and magnetic field characteristics of a focused radially polarized Gaussian vector beam. Such a beam is consistent with Maxwell's equations contrary to plane waves having uniform field distribution. Hence a realistic picture is provided of the focused field distributions having importance before designing applications such as particle acceleration. For focusing a perfectly reflecting large numerical aperture on-axis parabolic mirror was supposed to have practical importance. The computation technique was based on the Stratton-Chu vector diffraction method. We pointed out that this offers a unique opportunity in the long wavelength regime, where the Richards-Wolf theory becomes unreliable. In the terahertz frequency range longitudinal electric field component with an amplitude of $\sim$160 $\text{MV}/\text{cm}$ was predicted, which is ideal for particle acceleration applications. Based on the field characteristics experienced as a function of the focusing angle, the possibility of using a paraboloid ring for particle acceleration was suggested. Its advantage is reflected not only in the strong available longitudinal field but also in ensuring the unobstructed transfer of particles as a practical point of view. The axial and radial distributions of the longitudinal electric field component for different incident beam divergences were analyzed in detail. It was found that the shift of the physical focus relative to the geometrical focus along the longitudinal direction shows a linear dependence on the divergence. The effect of the divergence angle on the field enhancement factor was also studied.</description>

      <title>Improved Three-Dimensional Reconstructions in Electron Ptychography through Defocus Series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of ptychography for 3D phase reconstructions of thick specimens is performed. We introduce multi-focus ptychography, which incorporates a 4D-STEM defocus series to enhance the quality of 3D reconstructions along the beam direction through a higher overdetermination ratio. This method is compared with established multi-slice ptychography techniques, such as conventional ptychography, regularized ptychography, and multi-mode ptychography. Additionally, we contrast multi-focus ptychography with an alternative method that uses virtual optical sectioning through a reconstructed scattering matrix ($\mathcal{S}$-matrix), which offers more precise 3D structure information compared to conventional ptychography. Our findings from multiple 3D reconstructions based on simulated and experimental data demonstrate that multi-focus ptychography surpasses other techniques, particularly in accurately reconstructing the surfaces and interface regions of thick specimens.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Profile of Calabrian Opuntia ficus-indica Cladodes Extract: a Promising Low-cost Material for Technological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autofluorescence of calabrian Opuntia ficus-indica bioactive extract upon UV illumination is explored by fluorescence spectroscopy enabling to investigate the typology and distribution of responsible molecules within green cladodes. The spectroscopic analysis of the extract shows a significative red emission, suggesting an abundance of chlorophylls in the sample. Such molecules show pronounced fluorescence in the visible range (400-800 nm) with a very large Stokes shift, when excited with UV light source. The fluorescence profiling is performed also in the case of polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), enriched with OFI extract with a signal improvement up to 40 times greater than the extract alone. This by-product fluorescent molecule can replace commercial dyes into several applications spanning from nano-optics to anti-counterfeiting and bioimaging.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical optical response of particle plasmons with quantum informed local optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the dimensions of plasmonic structures or the field confinement length approach the mean free path of electrons, mesoscopic optical response effects, including nonlocality, electron density spill-in or spill-out, and Landau damping, are expected to become observable. In this work, we present a quantum-informed local analogue model (QILAM) that maps these nonclassical optical responses onto a local dielectric film. The primary advantage of this model lies in its compatibility with the highly efficient boundary element method (BEM), which includes retardation effects and eliminates the need to incorporate wavevector-dependent permittivity. Furthermore, our approach provides a unified framework that connects two important semiclassical theories: the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory and the Feibelman d-parameters formalism. We envision that QILAM could evolve into a multiscale electrodynamic tool for exploring nonclassical optical responses in diverse plasmonic structures in future. This could be achieved by directly translating mesoscopic effects into observable phenomena, such as resonance energy shifts and linewidth broadening in the scattering spectrum.</description>

      <title>Power output optimization in complex laser systems by means of polarization control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the polarimetricmethod for thermally-induced polarization changes driven power losses (TIPCL) mitigation in complex laser systems has been developed. However, the final optimization relied on the four-parameter numerical process. This letter provides a fully analytical direct calculation alternative to this optimization process. The validity of this approach is demonstrated on the previously published data from pulsed laser system Bivoj/DiPOLE100. The new approach provides a deeper insight into the polarimetric method for TIPCL suppression and also brings a more precise, reliable, and faster alternative to the numerical process used earlier.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear propagation of cylindrical vector beam through a non-degenerate four level atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-induced susceptibilities for both components of the probe vector beam (PVB) within an atomic system. The atoms are prepared in a non-degenerate four-level configuration. The transitions are coupled by a $\pi$ polarized control field and two orthogonally polarized components of a PVB. We show that the linear susceptibility of the medium depends on the phase shift between the control field and PVB, characterizing loss or gain in the system. Additionally, the phase shift causes polarization rotation in the vector beams (VBs) as they propagate. We further study the effect of nonlinearity on the VB propagation through the medium for a couple of Rayleigh lengths. The self-focusing and defocusing phenomena are observed for radial, azimuthal, and spiral VBs. The special chain-like self-focusing and defocusing leads to the formation of consecutive smaller spot sizes with moderate gain. Therefore, the mechanism of control of susceptibility and self-focusing may hold promise for applications such as transitioning from an absorber to an amplifier, high-resolution microscopy, and optical trap systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``nonlocal" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results open new avenues for exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Hybrid Refractive-Diffractive Lens Design with Differentiable Ray-Wave Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid refractive-diffractive lenses combine the light efficiency of refractive lenses with the information encoding power of diffractive optical elements (DOE), showing great potential as the next generation of imaging systems. However, accurately simulating such hybrid designs is generally difficult, and in particular, there are no existing differentiable image formation models for hybrid lenses with sufficient accuracy.
  In this work, we propose a new hybrid ray-tracing and wave-propagation (ray-wave) model for accurate simulation of both optical aberrations and diffractive phase modulation, where the DOE is placed between the last refractive surface and the image sensor, i.e. away from the Fourier plane that is often used as a DOE position. The proposed ray-wave model is fully differentiable, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end co-design of refractive-diffractive lens optimization and the image reconstruction network. We validate the accuracy of the proposed model by comparing the simulated point spread functions (PSFs) with theoretical results, as well as simulation experiments that show our model to be more accurate than solutions implemented in commercial software packages like Zemax. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through real-world experiments and show significant improvements in both aberration correction and extended depth-of-field (EDoF) imaging. We believe the proposed model will motivate further investigation into a wide range of applications in computational imaging, computational photography, and advanced optical design. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. This approach is employed to obtain a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system. We apply the transfer matrix method to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random number generation (QRNG) is a resource that is a necessity in the field of cryptography. However, its certification has been challenging. In this article, we certify randomness with the aid of quantum entanglement in a device independent setting, where we choose two-photon interference for source characterisation. The CHSH inequality violation and quantum state tomography are used as independent checks on the measurement devices. These measures ensure the unpredictability of quantum random number generation. This work can be easily extended to faster randomness expansion protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical heterodyne detection is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide range of physical excitations. Here, we use two types of optical heterodyne detection techniques (fundamental and parametric pumping) to microscopically characterize the high-frequency auto-oscillations of single and multiple nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). To validate the technique and demonstrate its robustness, we study SHNOs made from two different material stacks, NiFe/Pt and W/CoFeB/MgO, and investigate the influence of both the RF injection power and the laser power on the measurements, comparing the optical results to conventional electrical measurements. To demonstrate the key features of direct, non-invasive, submicron, spatial, and phase-resolved characterization of the SHNO magnetodynamics, we map out the auto-oscillation magnitude and phase of two phase-binarized SHNOs used in Ising Machines. This proof-of-concept platform establishes a strong foundation for further extensions, contributing to the ongoing development of crucial characterization techniques for emerging computing technologies based on spintronics devices</description>

      <title>Regarding the extension of metaplectic geometrical optics to modelling evanescent waves in ray-tracing codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior; MGO is currently unable to model such a transition. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the caustic shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the caustic shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of caustic shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used in the numerical implementation compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used provided that the symplectic rotation matrix used to remove caustics along the rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO solution and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes, and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>

      <title>Long-range ballistic propagation of 80$\%$-excitonic-fraction polaritons in a perovskite metasurface at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter elementary excitations arising from the strong coupling regime between excitons in semiconductors and photons in photonic nanostructures, offer a fruitful playground to explore the physics of quantum fluids of light as well as to develop all-optical devices. However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of spatial-photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) to address computationally intensive Ising problems that employ low-rank and circulant coupling matrices. Our results indicate that the performance of SPIMs is critically affected by the rank and precision of the coupling matrices. By developing and assessing advanced decomposition techniques, we expand the range of problems SPIMs can solve, overcoming the limitations of traditional Mattis-type matrices. Our approach accommodates a diverse array of coupling matrices, including those with inherently low ranks, applicable to complex NP-complete problems. We explore the practical benefits of low-rank approximation in optimization tasks, particularly in financial optimization, to demonstrate the real-world applications of SPIMs. Finally, we evaluate the computational limitations imposed by SPIM hardware precision and suggest strategies to optimize the performance of these systems within these constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-fidelity (MF) machine learning ensemble framework for the inverse design of photonic surfaces, trained on a dataset of 11,759 samples that we fabricate using high throughput femtosecond laser processing. The MF ensemble combines an initial low fidelity model for generating design solutions, with a high fidelity model that refines these solutions through local optimization. The combined MF ensemble can generate multiple disparate sets of laser-processing parameters that can each produce the same target input spectral emissivity with high accuracy (root mean squared errors &lt; 2%). SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis shows transparent model interpretability of the complex relationship between laser parameters and spectral emissivity. Finally, the MF ensemble is experimentally validated by fabricating and evaluating photonic surface designs that it generates for improved efficiency energy harvesting devices. Our approach provides a powerful tool for advancing the inverse design of photonic surfaces in energy harvesting applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons in metal nanoparticles are widely used in nano-optics to confine and enhance optical fields. It has been previously shown that, if the nanoparticles are distributed periodically, an additional enhancement can be achieved by coupling the localized surface plasmons to the diffraction orders of the lattice, forming surface lattice resonances. In this work, we study an even further improvement of the near-field enhancement by placing a metal-dielectric slab waveguide beneath the lattice of the particles to excite coupled waveguide-plasmon polaritons. These excitations can extend over many periods of the lattice, making the metasurface highly nonlocal. We numerically demonstrate that the approach can provide a significant extra increase in the near-field intensity -- by a factor of 80 over that produced by a single-particle plasmon resonance and by 7 over the lattice-resonance enhancement. The described enhancement mechanism can be used to design extraordinarily efficient nonlocal optical metasurfaces for many applications, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and solar energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: Liquid crystals, with their ability of self-assembly, strong response to the electric field, and integrability into complex systems, are key materials in light beam manipulation. Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals also possess a considerable second-order optical nonlinearity, making them a perspective material for nonlinear optics. Their use as sources of quantum light could drastically extend the boundaries of photonic quantum technologies. However, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the basic source of entangled photons, heralded single photons, and squeezed light, has been so far not observed in liquid crystals - or in any liquids or organic materials. Here, we implement spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and demonstrate electric-field tunable broadband generation of entangled photons, with the efficiency comparable to that of the best nonlinear crystals. The emission rate and polarization state of photon pairs is dramatically varied by applying a few volts or twisting the molecular orientation along the sample. A liquid crystal source enables a new type of quasi-phasematching, which is based on molecular twist structure and is therefore reconfigurable for the desired spectral and polarization properties of photon pairs. Such sources promise to outperform standard nonlinear optical materials in terms of functionality, brightness and the tunability of the generated quantum state. The concepts developed here can be extended to complex topological structures, macroscopic devices, and multi-pixel tunable quantum light sources.</description>

Abstract: Determination of refractive index of micro-disks of a calcinated ($1100^\circ$C in air) photo-resist SZ2080$^\mathrm{TM}$ was carried out using transmission and reflection spectroscopy. Interference fringes at specific wavenumbers/wavelengths were selected for determination of the optical thickness, hence, the refractive index when the thickness of micro-disks was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Refractive index of disks of $\sim 6\pm 1~\mu$m thickness were determined at visible and IR (2.5-13~$\mu$m) spectral ranges and where $2.2\pm 0.2$ at visible and IR wavelengths. Peculiarities of optical characterisation of micro-optical structures are discussed in view of possible uncertainties in the definition of geometric parameters, shape and mass density redistribution.</description>

      <title>Transformation, spectrum, and amplification of light modulated by a low frequency traveling wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium modulated in time and space, largely investigated decades ago, has attracted emerging current interest. Here, we address one of the key questions of this research: can an optical wave be amplified by a slowly modulated realistic photonic circuit? To solve this problem, we investigate the propagation of light with an initial phase velocity $v_0$ and frequency $\omega_0$ propagating through an optical waveguide and resonator modulated by a traveling wave with phase velocity $v_p$ and low frequency $\omega_p &lt;&lt; \omega_0$. Close to the synchronous condition, $v_p =v_0$, the modulation effects can significantly grow. Consequently, the bandwidth of the optical frequency comb spectrum can be dramatically enhanced by a synchronous traveling wave with $v_p \approx v_0$ compared to the bandwidth generated by an instantaneous wave with $v_p=\infty$. However, for realistic optical waveguides, the light amplification remains small due to its essentially broadband character. In contrast, we show that the modulation of a racetrack optical resonator by a traveling wave with a small phase velocity $v_p &lt;&lt;v_0$ (rather than with synchronous $v_p\approx v_0$) can significantly amplify light remaining within a relatively small bandwidth.</description>

Abstract: Surface lattice resonance supported on plasmonic nanoparticle arrays enhances light-matter interactions for applications such as photoluminescence enhancement. The photoluminescence process is enhanced through confining light beyond the diffraction limit and inducing stronger light-matter interaction. In this work, the absorption mechanisms of plasmonic nanoparticle arrays embedded with photoluminescent absorbers are analyzed. A modified coupled-mode theory that describes the optical behavior of the surface lattice resonance was developed and verified by numerical simulations. Based on the analytical model, different components of the absorption contributed by the nanoparticles and the absorbers as well as the resonant properties of each of the components are identified. The origin of difference in resonant behavior with different materials is also discovered by exploring the nearfield characteristics of surface lattice resonance composed with a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Dual-grating single-shot pump-probe technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported for studying the ultrafast dynamic processes in various materials. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of ~ 95.58 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. This time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The ultrafast dynamic processes of ZnSe and indolium squaraine at a wavelength of 650 nm were investigated using this technique.</description>

      <title>Laser Printing of Silver and Silver Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that direct laser writing (DLW) in aqueous silver nitrate with a 1030 nm femtosecond (fs) laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm fs DLW. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%. While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>

Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

      <title>Control of the local and nonlocal electromagnetic response in all-dielectric reconfigurable metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable metasurfaces are potent platforms to control the propagation properties of light dynamically. Among different reconfiguration mechanisms available at optical frequencies, using non-volatile phase change materials is one of the most prominent. Tuning the refractive index of these materials, and thus changing the electromagnetic response of the device, can be achieved by external modulation that enables the transition between their amorphous and crystalline structural states. In this work, we study a structure that exploits these materials to fully control the electromagnetic response, i.e., electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic coupling. Powered by this controllability, we present how the metasurface can be designed to perform beam steering and switchable one-way absorption applications. In addition, we demonstrate that the same platform can be designed to work in a nonlocal regime to implement a more efficient way of controlling light.</description>

      <title>Symmetric silicon microring resonator optical crossbar array for accelerated inference and training in deep learning</title>

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a promising platform for accelerating matrix multiplications in deep learning, leveraging the inherent parallel nature of light. Although various schemes have been proposed and demonstrated to realize such photonic matrix accelerators, the in-situ training of artificial neural networks using photonic accelerators remains challenging due to the difficulty of direct on-chip backpropagation on a photonic chip. In this work, we propose a silicon microring resonator (MRR) optical crossbar array with a symmetric structure that allows for simple on-chip backpropagation, potentially enabling the acceleration of both the inference and training phases of deep learning. We demonstrate a $4 \times 4$ circuit on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and use it to perform inference tasks of a simple neural network for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Subsequently, we train the neural network using simulated on-chip backpropagation and achieve an accuracy of 91.1% in the same inference task after training. Furthermore, we simulate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, using a $9 \times 9$ MRR crossbar array to perform the convolution operations. This work contributes to the realization of compact and energy-efficient photonic accelerators for deep learning.</description>

      <title>Tunable Collective Excitations in Epitaxial Perovskite Nickelates</title>

Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of many-body interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through a comprehensive experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for LSNO with a doping concentration of x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our results underscore the profound impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structure and the formation of plasmon in strongly-correlated systems. This in turn suggest that LSNO could serve as a promising alternative material in optoelectronic devices.</description>
