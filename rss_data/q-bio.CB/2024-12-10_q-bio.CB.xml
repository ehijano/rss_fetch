      <title>A mathematical model for smooth muscle cell phenotype switching in atherosclerotic plaque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play a fundamental role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. SMCs may ingest lipids in a similar way to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in the plaque. This can stimulate SMCs to undergo a phenotypic switch towards a macrophage-like phenotype. We formulate an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for the populations of SMCs, MDMs and smooth muscle cell-derived macrophages (SDMs) and the internalised lipid load in each population. We use this model to explore the effect on plaque fate of SMC phenotype switching. We find that when SMCs switch to a macrophage-like phenotype, the total lipid contained in cells in the plaque increases. Additionally, removal of SMCs from the plaque via phenotype switching reduces the fibrous plaque cap, increases the lipid in the necrotic core, and increases plaque inflammation. This makes the plaque more vulnerable to rupture, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. When SDMs are highly proliferative and resistant to cell death, the plaque grows rapidly and becomes highly pathological. The model suggests that plaque dynamics, driven by the switch of SMCs to a macrophage-like phenotype, may drive the development of unstable, vulnerable and pathological plaques.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle with saturating rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle whose speed and tumbling rate are space-dependent on an infinite line. Unlike most of the previous work on such models, here we make the physical assumption that at large distances, these rates saturate to a constant. For our choice of rate functions, we show that a stationary state exists, and the exact steady state distribution decays exponentially or faster and can be unimodal or bimodal. The effect of boundedness of rates is seen in the mean-squared displacement of the particle that displays qualitative features different from those observed in the previous studies where it approaches the stationary state value monotonically in time; in contrast, here we find that if the initial position of the particle is sufficiently far from the origin, the variance in its position either varies nonmonotonically or plateaus before reaching the stationary state. These results are captured quantitatively by the exact solution of the Green's function when the particle has uniform speed but the tumbling rates change as a step-function in space; the insights provided by this limiting case are found to be consistent with the numerical results for the general model.</description>
