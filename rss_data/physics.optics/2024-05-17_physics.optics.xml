      <title>Plasmonic Nanocavity to Boost Single Photon Emission from Defects in Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and compact single photon emission platforms operating at room temperature with ultrafast speed and high brightness will be fundamental components of the emerging quantum communications and computing fields. However, so far, it has been very challenging to design practical deterministic single photon emitters based on nanoscale solid state materials that meet the fast emission rate and strong brightness demands. Here we provide a solution to this longstanding problem by using metallic nanocavities integrated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with defects acting as nanoscale single photon emitters (SPEs) at room temperature. The presented hybrid nanophotonic structure creates a rapid speedup and large enhancement in single photon emission at room temperature. Hence, the nonclassical light emission performance is substantially improved compared to plain hBN flakes and hBN on gold layered structures without nanocavity. Extensive theoretical calculations are also performed to accurately model the new hybrid nanophotonic system and prove that the incorporation of plasmonic nanocavity is key to the efficient SPE performance. The proposed quantum nanocavity single photon source is expected to be an element of paramount importance to the envisioned room temperature integrated quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Amplification in the Frozen Mode Regime Enabled by a Nonlinear Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stationary inflection point (SIP) is a spectral singularity of the Bloch dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ of a periodic structure where the first and the second derivatives of $\omega$ with respect to $k$ vanish. An SIP is associated with a third order exceptional point degeneracy in the spectrum of the unit-cell transfer matrix, where there is a collapse of one propagating and two evanescent Bloch modes. At the SIP frequency, the incident wave can be efficiently converted into the frozen mode with greatly enhanced amplitude and vanishing group velocity. This can be very attractive for applications, including light amplification. Due to its non-resonant nature, the frozen mode regime (FMR) has fundamental advantages over common cavity resonances. Here, we propose a novel scheme for FMR-based unidirectional amplifiers by leveraging a tailored amplification/attenuation mechanism and a single nonlinear defect. The defect breaks the directional symmetry of the periodic structure and enables nonlinearity-related unidirectional amplification/ attenuation in the vicinity of the SIP frequency. We demonstrate the robustness of the amplification mechanism to local impurities and parasitic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Spatial-temporal manipulations of visible nanosecond sub-pulse sequences in an actively Q-switched Pr:YLF laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed visible lasers either by Q-switching or mode locking have been attracting intense attentions both in solid-state laser and fiber laser. Here, we report on the simultaneous manipulation of reconfigurable sub-pulse sequences and customizable high-order vortex beams in an actively Q-switched visible laser. On the one hand, pulse sequences with up to 4 sub-pulses could be generated and fully controlled by means of an acoustic-optic modulator driven by an arbitrary waveform generator. Both pulse number and pulse intensity can be manipulated through the programmable step-signal, which is also theoretically simulated through the rate equations. On the other hand, assisted by the off-axis pumping technique and the astigmatic mode conversion, the laser cavity could emit high-quality vortex beams carrying Laguerre-Gaussian modes up to 30th order. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most flexible active manipulations not only on the intensity distribution of the transverse modes but also on the temporal distribution of the pulse sequences in a visible laser. The versatile manipulating techniques in this work could be immediately implemented into all other solid-state lasers to obtain sub-pulse vortex beams, which may provide enhanced functionality and flexibility for a large range of laser systems.</description>

      <title>Electrically switchable $2^N$-channel wave-front control with N cascaded polarization-dependent metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the operating channels of polarization-dependent metasurfaces, we proposed a structure of $N$ cascaded dual-channel metasurfaces to achieve $2^N$ electrically switchable functional channels without intrinsic noise or cross-talk. As proof of principles, we have implemented a 3-layer setup to achieve 8 switchable channels. In success, we have demonstrated two typical applications of vortex beam generation with switchable topological charge of l=-3 ~ +4 or l=-1~ -8, and beam steering with the deflecting direction switchable in an 8*1 line or a 4*2 grid. We believe that our proposal would provide a practical way to extend the functionality of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, which are potential for the applications of LiDAR, glasses-free 3D display, OAM (de)multiplexing, and varifocal meta-lens.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are of a great interest due to their extremely low waveguides losses. The number of Si3N4 integrated photonics platform applications is constantly growing including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices, hybrid neuromorphic and quantum computing. Their heterogeneous integration with a III-V platform leads to a new advanced large scale PICs with thousands of elements. Here, we review key trends in Si3N4 integrated circuits technology and fill an information gap in the field of state-of-the-art photonic devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectra. A comprehensive overview of Si3N4 integrared circtuis microfabrication process details (deposition, lithography, etching, etc.) is introduced. Finally, we point out the limits and challenges of silicon nitride photonics performance in an ultrawide range providing routes and prospects for their future scaling and optimization.</description>

      <title>On-chip integrated metasystem for spin-dependent multi-channel colour holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip integrated metasurface driven by in-plane guided waves is of great interests in various light field manipulation applications such as colorful augmented reality and holographic display. However, it remains a challenge to design colorful multichannel holography by a single on-chip metasurface. Here we present metasurfaces integrated on top of guided-wave photonic slab that achieves multi-channel colorful holographic light display. An end-to-end scheme is used to inverse design the metasurface for projecting off-chip preset multiple patterns. Particular examples are presented for customized patterns that were encoded into the metasurface with a single-cell meta-atom, working simultaneously at RGB color channels and for several different diffractive distance, with polarization dependence. Holographic images are generated at 18 independent channels with such a single-cell metasurface. The proposed design scheme is easy to implement and the resulting device is viable to fabrication, promising a plenty of applications in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>In-situ optical vector analysis based on integrated lithium niobate single-sideband modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vector analysis (OVA) is an enabling technology for comprehensively characterizing both amplitude and phase responses of optical devices or systems. Conventional OVA technologies are mostly based on discrete optoelectronic components, leading to unsatisfactory system sizes, complexity, and stability. They also encounter challenges in revealing the on-chip characteristics of integrated photonic devices, which are often overwhelmed by the substantial coupling loss and extra spectral response at chip facets. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized OVA system for integrated photonics devices based on broadband single sideband (SSB) modulators on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. The OVA could provide a direct probe of both amplitude and phase responses of photonic devices with kHz-level resolution and tens of terahertz measurement bandwidth. We perform in-situ characterizations of single and coupled microring resonators fabricated on the same chip as the OVA, unfolding their intrinsic loss and coupling states unambiguously. Furthermore, we achieve the direct measurement of collective phase dynamics and density of states of the Bloch modes in a synthetic frequency crystal, by in-situ OVA of a dynamically modulated microring resonator. Our in-situ OVA system provides a compact, high-precision, and broadband solution for characterizing future integrated photonic devices and circuits, with potential applications ranging from optical communications, biosensing, neuromorphic computing, to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Beyond memory-effect matrix-based imaging in scattering media by acousto-optic gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging inside scattering media at optical resolution is a longstanding challenge affecting multiple fields, from bio-medicine to astronomy. In recent years, several groundbreaking techniques for imaging inside scattering media, in particular scattering-matrix based approaches, have shown great promise, but usually suffer from a restricted field of view (FOV) due to their reliance on the optical 'memory-effect'. Here, we demonstrate that by combining acousto-optic spatial-gating with state-of-the-art matrix-based imaging techniques, diffraction-limited imaging beyond the optical memory-effect can be achieved in a robust fashion. Specifically, we show that this can be achieved by computational processing of scattered light fields captured under scanned acousto-optic modulation. The approach can be directly utilized whenever the ultrasound focus size is of the order of the memory-effect range, independently of the scattering angle.</description>

      <title>Electrically Injected mid-infrared GeSn laser on Si operating at 140 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its true direct bandgap and tunable bandgap energies,GeSn alloys are increasingly attractive as gain media for mid-IR lasers that can be monolithically integrated on Si. Demonstrations of optically pumped GeSn laser at room under pulsed condition and at cryogenic temperature under continuous-wave excitation show great promise of GeSn lasers to be efficient electrically injected light sources on Si. Here we report electrically injected GeSn lasers using Fabry-Perot cavity with 20, 40, and 80 micron ridge widths. A maximum operating temperature of 140 K with lasing threshold of 0.756 kA/cm2 at 77 K and emitting wavelength of 2722 nm at 140 K was obtained. The lower threshold current density compared to previous works was achieved by reducing optical loss and improving the optical confinement. The peak power was measured as 2.2 mW/facet at 77 K.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Transmission through Polarization-Controlled Riemann Surface Evolution Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies at which two or more eigenvalues and eigenstates of a non-Hermtian system coalesce. Dynamically encircling EPs leads to chiral mode switching, where the final state of the system depends on the encircling handedness. In conventional schemes, the encircling direction is the same for different polarization states of the same mode, resulting in the same chiral transmission. Here, by mapping evolution path onto a double couple L-shaped silicon waveguide, we demonstrate opposite evolution directions for modes with different polarizations, thus achieving opposite asymmetric transmission results. Our work shows that the polarization state of the input mode can also serve as a variable parameter influencing the evolution path on the Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fast Gain Dynamics in Interband Cascade Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICL) have matured into a versatile technological platform in the mid-infrared spectral domain. To broaden their applicability even further, ongoing research pursues the emission of ultrashort pulses. The most promising approach is passive mode-locking with a fast saturable absorber. However, despite vast attempts no passive mode-locked ICL has been demonstrated up to date. In this study we perform pump-probe measurements on the ICL gain and show that its dynamics are mainly ($\sim$70%) governed by a fast recovery time of 2 ps. Our findings explain why passive mode-locking has not succeeded so far, shedding a new light on ICL dynamics as we propose strategies to overcome the current limitations.</description>

      <title>The Best Radar Ranging Pulse to Resolve Two Reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work established fundamental bounds on subwavelength resolution for the radar range resolution problem, called superradar [Phys. Rev. Appl. 20, 064046 (2023)]. In this work, we identify the optimal waveforms for distinguishing the range resolution between two reflectors of identical strength. We discuss both the unnormalized optimal waveform as well as the best square-integrable pulse, and their variants. Using orthogonal function theory, we give an explicit algorithm to optimize the wave pulse in finite time to have the best performance. We also explore range resolution estimation with unnormalized waveforms with multi-parameter methods to also independently estimate loss and time of arrival. These results are consistent with the earlier single parameter approach of range resolution only and give deeper insight into the ranging estimation problem. Experimental results are presented using radio pulse reflections inside coaxial cables, showing robust range resolution smaller than a tenth of the inverse bandedge, with uncertainties close to the derived Cram\'er-Rao bound.</description>

      <title>The appeal of small molecules for practical nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small organic molecules with a {\pi}-conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor- and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third-order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor-acceptor substitution. This enables strong third-order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric-field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro-optic functionality to state-of-the-art integrated photonics platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval from the Hong-Ou-Mandel Dip to Characterize the Phase Spectrum of Independent Pulses at the Single-Photon Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the phase spectrum at the single-photon level is essential for the full characterization of the temporal-spectral mode of quantum sources. We present a phase retrieval algorithm-based method to recover the phase spectrum difference between two independent pulses from their Hong-Ou-Mandel interference pattern and intensity spectra. Our confirmatory experiment with coherent state pulses confirms the accuracy of the recovered phase spectrum difference to within plus or minus 0.1 rad. The method we employ is readily generalizable to the measurement of single-photon wave packets and even correlated photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanically induced transparency in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analytically present the phenomena of nanomechanically induced transparency (NMIT) and transmission rate in a parity-time-symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) opto-nanomechanical system (ONMS) where a levitated dielectric nanospheres is trapped near the antinodes closest to right mirror of passive cavity which further coupled to an active cavity via hoping factor. We find that the phenomenon of NMIT may be generated from the output probe field in the presence of an effective opto-nanomechanical coupling between the cavity field and the nanosphere, whose steady-state position is influenced by the Coulomb interaction between the cavity mirror and the nanosphere. In addition, the width and height of the transparency window can be controlled through the effective optomechanical coupling, which is readily adjusted by altering changing the nanosphere's radius and the Coulomb interaction. One of the most interesting result is the transition NMIT behavior in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime. We show that the presence of nanosphere in the passive cavity enhances the width and transmission rate of NMIT window in passive-passive regime and in passive-active regime, a notable decrease of sideband amplification has been observed. These results show that our scheme may find some potential applications for optical signal processing an and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme to realize quantum controlled-Z (CZ) gates through single gradient metasurface. Using its unique parallel beam-splitting feature, i.e., a series of connected beam splitters with the same splitting ratio, one metasurface can support a CZ gate, several independent CZ gates, or a cascaded CZ gates. Taking advantage of the input polarization determined output path-locking feature, both polarization-encoded and path-encoded CZ gates can be demonstrated on the same metasurface, which further improves the integration level of quantum devices. Our research paves the way for integrating quantum logical function through the metasurface.</description>

      <title>Photon emission from macroscopic currents</title>

Abstract: Coherent states are a well-established tool of quantum optics to describe electromagnetic waves in terms of photons. However, they do not describe the near-field regime of radiation sources. Instead, we generically use classical solutions of Maxwell's equations to describe radiation in the near-field regime. The classical solutions provide linear relations between currents and emitted electromagnetic fields, whereas evolution of states at the quantum level proceeds through unitary time evolution operators involving photon operators. This begs questions how the classical radiation equations relate to unitary quantum evolution, and how we can describe macroscopic fields from antennas or magnetic coils in terms of elementary photons. The present paper answers both questions through the construction of generalized Glauber states for radiation emitters.</description>

      <title>Refractive index sensing based on large negative Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of wavy dielectric grating</title>

Abstract: Wavy dielectric grating hosts bound states in the continuum (BICs) at nonzero Bloch wave number. For oblique incident optical field with parameters near to the BICs, the reflectance spectrum exhibits ultra-sharp Fano line shape, and the reflected beam has large negative Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift, due to excitation of the corresponding quasi-BIC with negative group velocity. Under incidence of Gaussian beam with sizable beam width, the excited quasi-BIC could travel a long distance along the direction of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift, designated as $L_{GH}$, before the energy is completely radiated. If the length between the termination of the wavy shape and the focus of the incident Gaussian beam is smaller than $L_{GH}$, sizable energy flux can be coupled into the waveguide mode of the flat dielectric slab that is connected to the wavy dielectric grating. Measurement of the energy flux of the waveguide mode can sense the variation of the refractive index of the background medium. The proposed sensing scheme can be integrated with waveguide in optical circuit.</description>

      <title>Investigation of nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides for on-chip evanescent wave sensing</title>

Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising photonic platform for on-chip optical sensing because both nonlinear and linear components can be fabricated within one integrated device. To date, waveguided sample interactions for thin-film lithium niobate are not well explored. Compared to other integrated platforms, lithium niobate's high refractive index, birefringence, and angled sidewalls present unique design challenges for evanescent wave sensing. Here, we compare the performance of the quasi-transverse-electric (TE) and the quasi-transverse-magnetic (TM) mode for sensing on a thin-film lithium niobate rib waveguide with a 5 mM dye-doped polymer cladding pumped at 406 nm. We determine that both modes have propagation losses dominated by scatter, and that the absorption due to the sample only accounts for 3% of the measured losses for both modes. The TM mode has better overlap with the sample than the TE mode, but the TM mode also has a stronger propagation loss due to sidewall and sample induced scattering (32.5 $\pm$ 0.3 dB/cm) compared to the TE mode (23.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dB/cm). The TE mode is, therefore, more appropriate for sensing. Our findings have important implications for on-chip lithium niobate-based sensor designs.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>

Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

      <title>Simulating Light Propagation through Biological Media Using Monte-Carlo Method</title>

Abstract: Biological tissues are complex structures composed of many elements which make light-based tissue diagnostics challenging. Over the past decades, Monte Carlo technique has been used as a fundamental and versatile approach toward modeling photon-tissue interactions. This report first describes a MC simulation of steady-state light transport in an absorbing and diffusing multi-layered structure. Further, a parallel processing solution is implemented to reduce execution time and memory requirements. Then, the nonparametric phase function, which is a discretized version of the phase function, has been discussed where the integration of the phase function is a numerical process, instead of an analytical operation. Finally, to simulate more realistic structures of biological systems, simulations are modified to incorporate objects of various shapes (sphere, ellipsoid, or cylinder) with a refractive-index mismatched boundary. The output files mainly contain 2D reflection matrix, 2D transmission matrix, and 3D absorption matrix.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose a new criterion for bulk dynamical phases based on experimentally observable features and applicable to any dimensions and any boundary conditions. Based on this criterion, we define the bulk dispersive-to-proliferative phase transition, which is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition and contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>

      <title>Towards a fiber-optic temporally multiplexed single photon source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a photon source with sub-Poissonian emission statistics through temporal multiplexing of a continuous wave heralded photon source in the optical communications wavelength range. We use the time arrival information of a heralding photon to actively modify the delay of the heralded photon in an all-fiber assembly, in order to synchronize the output with with respect to an external clock. Within this synchronized operating regime we show that the addition of a single temporal correcting stage can improve the figure of merit for single photon emission of a heralded photon source. We obtain a brightness improvement factor of approximately 1.8 and an enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, quantified by the coincidence-to-accidental counts ratio. These results, clear the way for integrated optics non-classical photon sources in the optical communication band.</description>
