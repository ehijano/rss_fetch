      <title>Fold-switching Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular proteins are expected to assume folds with fixed secondary structures, alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Fold-switching proteins challenge this expectation by remodeling their secondary and/or tertiary structures in response to cellular stimuli. Though these shapeshifting proteins were once thought to be haphazard evolutionary byproducts with little intrinsic biological relevance, recent work has shown that evolution has selected for their dual-folding behavior, which plays critical roles in biological processes across all kingdoms of life. The widening scope of fold switching draws attention to the ways it challenges conventional wisdom, raising fundamental unanswered questions about protein structure, biophysics, and evolution. Here we discuss the progress being made to answer these questions and suggest future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Protein Structure Prediction Using the Face-Centered Cubic Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm. Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2 (ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture, highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.</description>
