      <title>Deformed natural orbitals for ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of ab initio nuclear structure methods towards doubly open-shell nuclei, heavy nuclei and greater accuracy occurs at the price of evermore increased computational costs, especially RAM and CPU time. While most of the numerical simulations are carried out by expanding relevant operators and wave functions on the spherical harmonic oscillator basis, alternative one-body bases offering advantages in terms of computational efficiency have recently been investigated. In particular, the so-called natural basis used in combination with symmetry-conserving methods applicable to doubly closed-shell nuclei has proven beneficial in this respect. The present work examines the performance of the natural basis in the context of symmetry-breaking many-body calculations enabling the description of superfluid and deformed open-shell nuclei at polynomial cost with system's size. First, it is demonstrated that the advantage observed for closed-shell nuclei carries over to open-shell ones. A detailed investigation of natural-orbital wave functions provides useful insight to support this finding and to explain the superiority of the natural basis over alternative ones. Second, it is shown that the use of natural orbitals combined with importance-truncation techniques leads to an even greater gain in terms of computational costs. The presents results pave the way for the systematic use of natural-orbital bases in future implementations of non-perturbative many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description of hadronic matter from a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic nuclear matter formalism with explicit chiral symmetry based on the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is considered to describe nuclear matter. To reproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density, four-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian inference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing nuclear matter, both experimental and from {\it ab-initio} calculations, and neutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well reproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation density. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\rm M_\odot$ star varies between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\sim 2.2 ~\rm M_\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\odot$ star is above 10.5 km. High-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that predict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases monotonically with density and reaches values as large as $\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties such as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been proposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed. Interestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD constraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR J0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.</description>

      <title>Influence of effective nucleon mass on equation of state for supernova simulations and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.8$) compared to the TM1e model ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.63$), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compared with those of the TM1e and original TM1 models. Both the TM1m and TM1e models are found to be compatible with the latest constraints on tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, derived from astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of nuclear deformation on $\beta$-decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated $\beta$-decay half-lives of 55 neutron-rich nuclei. The deformation values were computed using DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 interactions in the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model. Yet another set of deformation was adopted from the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM). The model-dependent deformation values were used as a free parameter in the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation model to calculate the $\beta$-decay properties under terrestrial and stellar conditions. The Gamow-Teller strength distributions, branching ratios, half-lives and stellar weak rates of selected nuclei were later investigated. It was concluded that the $\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei changed with nuclear deformation. The FRDM computed deformation values provided the best predictions for calculated half-lives followed by the DD-ME2 functional. The terrestrial $\beta$-decay half-lives changed up to 3 orders of magnitude and the stellar $\beta$-rates within a factor of 2 as the neutron-rich nuclei switched their geometrical configurations. For magic number nucleus $^{138}$Sn, the stellar rates changed substantially by more than 1 order of magnitude as the nucleus transitioned away from the spherical shape. Our investigation might prove useful for a realistic modeling of nucleosynthesis calculation.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks at large $M$ and large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tetraquarks in large $N$ QCD with heavy quarks, in the domain where non-relativistic quantum mechanics offers an adequate approximation. Within the regime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we systematically study and explicitly construct tetraquark states. At leading order in the $1/N$ expansion, the bound spectrum consists of free mesons, while the $1/N$ corrections give rise to a Born-Oppenheimer potential that can bind the mesons into tetraquarks. We find two different types of tetraquarks, each endowed with distinct color-spatial wavefunctions. These states arise in the presence of an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ mass hierarchy between the quarks and the antiquarks. We provide a quantitative argument indicating that only for such a hierarchy is the ground state of the system a tetraquark. We discuss what the extrapolation of our results to realistic values of the parameters may imply for the QCD tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of the low-energy constants up to fourth order in the nucleon-nucleon sector of chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Bayesian methods and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling to infer the posterior probability density function (PDF) for the low-energy constants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-next- to-leading order (N3LO) in a chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) description of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. In a first step, we condition the inference on neutron-proton and proton-proton scattering data and account for uncorrelated $\chi$EFT truncation errors. We demonstrate how to successfully sample the 31-dimensional space of LECs at N3LO using a revised HMC inference protocol. In a second step we extend the analysis by means of importance sampling and an empirical determination of the neutron-neutron scattering length to infer the posterior PDF for the leading charge-dependent contact LEC in the $^{1}S_0$ neutron-neutron interaction channel. While doing so we account for the $\chi$EFT truncation error via a conjugate prior. We use the resulting posterior PDF to sample the posterior predictive distributions for the effective range parameters in the $^{1}S_0$ wave as well as the strengths of charge-symmetry breaking and charge-independence breaking. We conclude that empirical point-estimate results of isospin breaking in the $^{1}S_0$ channel are consistent with the PDFs obtained in our Bayesian analysis and that, when accounting for $\chi$EFT truncation errors, one must go to next-to-next-to-leading order to confidently detect isospin breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Inference of the low-energy constants in $\Delta$-full chiral effective field theory including a correlated truncation error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We sample the posterior probability distributions of the low-energy constants (LECs) in $\Delta$-full chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) up to third order. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of the likelihood and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to draw effectively independent samples from the posteriors. Our Bayesian inference is conditioned on the Granada database of neutron-proton ($np$) cross sections and polarizations. We use priors grounded in $\chi$EFT assumptions and a Roy-Steiner analysis of pion-nucleon scattering data. We model correlated EFT truncation errors using a two-feature Gaussian process, and find correlation lengths for $np$ scattering energies and angles in the ranges 45--83 MeV and 24--39 degrees, respectively. These correlations yield a non-diagonal covariance matrix and reduce the number of independent scattering data with a factor of 8 and 4 at the second and third chiral orders, respectively. The relatively small difference between the second and third order predictions in $\Delta$-full $\chi$EFT suppresses the marginal variance of the truncation error and the effects of its correlation structure. Our results are particularly important for analyzing the predictive capabilities in \textit{ab initio} nuclear theory.</description>

      <title>Precise neural network predictions of energies and radii from the no-core shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For light nuclei, ab initio many-body methods such as the no-core shell model are the tools of choice for predictive, high-precision nuclear structure calculations. The applicability and the level of precision of these methods, however, is limited by the model-space truncation that has to be employed to make such computations feasible. We present a universal framework based on artificial neural networks to predict the value of observables for an infinite model-space size based on finite-size no-core shell model data. Expanding upon our previous ansatz of training the neural networks to recognize the observable-specific convergence pattern with data from few-body nuclei, we improve the results obtained for ground-state energies and show a way to handle excitation energies within this framework. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the prediction of converged root-mean-square radii, which are more difficult due to the much less constrained convergence behavior. For all observables robust and statistically significant uncertainties are extracted via the sampling over a large number of network realizations and evaluation data samples.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>
