      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the ensemble of maximal center gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal Center Gauge (MCG) aims to detect center vortices by maximizing a gauge functional and then projecting onto the center elements of the respective group. The requirement for unrestricted maximization of the gauge functional has proven to be untenable because it was shown that it leads to an underestimation of the string tension. To counter this problem, the ensemble of local gauge maxima is investigated and it is found that the unrestricted maximization can be replaced by a maximization restricted to the Gaussian distributed part of the ensemble. Such restricted maximization weakens the problem of an underestimated string tension.</description>

      <title>Pion mass dependence in $D\pi$ scattering and the $D_0^*(2300)$ resonance from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD results for isospin $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $D\pi$ scattering are presented. Utilizing a series of $N_{\text{f}}=2+1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with pion masses of $m_\pi \approx 132, 208, 305$ and $317$ MeV, various two-particle operators are constructed and the corresponding finite-volume spectra are determined. The $S$ and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts are then extracted using the L\"{u}scher approach. A clear trend for the motion of the $D_0^*(2300)$ pole is identified. With the physical pion mass configurations also included, this calculation constitutes the first lattice calculation in which the pion mass dependence of the $D_0^*(2300)$ pole is investigated and the scattering lengths are extrapolated/interpolated to the physical pion mass in $D\pi$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Neutron electric dipole moment from isovector quark chromo-electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from our lattice QCD study of the contribution of the isovector quark cEDM (qcEDM) operator to the neutron EDM. The calculation was carried out on four 2+1+1-flavor highly improved staggered quark ensembles (provided to us by the MILC collaboration) using Wilson-clover quarks to construct correlation functions. We use the nonsinglet axial Ward identity including corrections up to O(a) to show how to control the power-divergent mixing of the isovector qcEDM operator with the lower dimensional pseudoscalar operator. Results for the nEDM are presented after conversion to the MS scheme at the leading-log order.</description>

      <title>Full QCD with milder topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate $N_f=2+1$ QCD at the physical point combining open and periodic boundary conditions in a parallel tempering framework, following the original proposal by M. Hasenbusch for $2d$ $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models, which has been recently implemented and widely employed in $4d$ $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theories too. We show that using this algorithm it is possible to achieve an impressive reduction of the auto-correlation time of the topological charge in dynamical fermions simulations both at zero and finite temperature up to two orders of magnitude, allowing to avoid topology freezing down to lattice spacings as fine as $a \sim 0.02$ fm. Therefore, this implementation of the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions algorithm has the potential to substantially push forward the investigation of the QCD vacuum properties by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect from simulations on Euclidean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and features a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating perfect agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in RHIC isobar run.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Circuits for Preparing Ground States on Digital Quantum Computers: The Schwinger Model Vacuum on 100 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined using classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introducing an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>
