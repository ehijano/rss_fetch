      <title>Advances in imaging techniques for the study of individual bacteria and their pathophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial heterogeneity is pivotal for adaptation to diverse environments, posing significant challenges in microbial diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Recent advancements in high-resolution optical microscopy have revolutionized our ability to observe and characterize individual bacteria, offering unprecedented insights into their metabolic states and behaviors at the single-cell level. This review discusses the transformative impact of various high-resolution imaging techniques, including fluorescence and label-free imaging, which have enhanced our understanding of bacterial pathophysiology. These methods provide detailed visualizations that are crucial for developing targeted treatments and improving clinical diagnostics. We highlight the integration of these imaging techniques with computational tools, which has facilitated rapid, accurate pathogen identification and real-time monitoring of bacterial responses to treatments. The ongoing development of these optical imaging technologies promises to significantly advance our understanding of microbiology and to catalyze the translation of these insights into practical healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>The multiscale mechanics of axon durotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During neurodevelopment, neuronal axons navigate through the extracellular environment, guided by various cues to establish connections with distant target cells. Among other factors, axon trajectories are influenced by heterogeneities in environmental stiffness, a process known as durotaxis, the guidance by substrate stiffness gradients. Here, we develop a three-scale model for axonal durotaxis. At the molecular scale, we characterise the mechanical interaction between the axonal growth cone cytoskeleton, based on molecular-clutch-type interactions dependent on substrate stiffness. At the growth cone scale, we spatially integrate this relationship to obtain a model for the traction generated by the entire growth cone. Finally, at the cell scale, we model the axon as a morphoelastic filament growing on an adhesive substrate, and subject to durotactic growth cone traction. Firstly, the model predicts that, depending on the local substrate stiffness, axons may exhibit positive or negative durotaxis, and we show that this key property entails the existence of attractive zones of preferential stiffness in the substrate domain. Second, we show that axons will exhibit reflective and refractive behaviour across interface between regions of different stiffness, a basic process which may serve in the deflection of axons. Lastly, we test our model in a biological scenario wherein durotaxis was previously identified as a possible guidance mechanism in vivo. Overall, this work provides a general mechanistic theory for exploring complex effects in axonal mechanotaxis and guidance in general.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Flagellar Gait Changes with Combined Shape Mode Analysis and Swimming Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many different microswimmers propel themselves using flagella that beat periodically. The shape of the flagellar beat and swimming speed have been observed to change with fluid rheology. We quantify changes in the flagellar waveforms of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to changes in fluid viscosity using (1) shape mode analysis and (2) a full swimmer simulation to analyze how shape changes affect the swimming speed and to explore the dimensionality of the shape space. By decomposing the gait into the time-independent mean shape and the time-varying stroke, we find that the flagellar mean shape substantially changes in response to viscosity, while the changes in the time-varying stroke are more subtle. Using the swimmer simulation, we quantify how the swimming speed is affected by the dimensionality of the flagellar shape reconstruction, and we show that the observed change in swimming speed with viscosity is explained by the variations in mean flagellar shape and beat frequency, while the changes in swimming speed from the different time-varying strokes are on the scale of variation between cells.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of enzymatic reactions due to nearby inactive binding sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological molecular motors and machines are driven by chemical reactions that occur in specific catalytic sites. We study whether the arrival of molecules to such an active site can be accelerated by the presence of a nearby inactive site. Our approach is based on comparing the steady-state current in simple models to reference models without an inactive site. We identify two parameter regimes in which the reaction is accelerated. We then find the transition rates that maximize this acceleration, and use them to determine the underlying mechanisms in each region. In the first regime, the inactive site stores a molecule in order to release it following a reaction, when the neighboring catalytic site is empty. In the second regime, the inactive site releases a molecule when the catalytic site is full, in order to impede the molecules from leaving the active site before they react. For the storage mechanism, which is more likely to be biologically relevant, the acceleration can reach up to 15%, depending on parameters.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Linking Histological Changes to Liver Viscoelasticity: A Hybrid Analytical-Computational Micromechanics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by elastography that utilizes tissue mechanical properties as biomarkers for liver disease, with the eventual objective of quantitatively linking histopathology and bulk mechanical properties, we develop a micromechanical modeling approach to capture the effects of fat and collagen deposition in the liver. Specifically, we utilize computational homogenization to convert the microstructural changes in hepatic lobule to the effective viscoelastic modulus of the liver tissue, i.e., predict the bulk material properties by analyzing the deformation of repeating unit cell. The lipid and collagen deposition is simulated with the help of ad hoc algorithms informed by histological observations. Collagen deposition is directly included in the computational model, while composite material theory is used to convert fat content to the microscopic mechanical properties, which in turn is included in the computational model. The results illustrate the ability of the model to capture the effect of both fat and collagen deposition on the viscoelastic moduli and represents a step towards linking histopathological changes in the liver to its bulk mechanical properties, which can eventually provide insights for accurate diagnosis with elastography.</description>
