      <title>A tale of two emergent games: opinion dynamics in dynamical directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uni-directional social interactions are ubiquitous in real social networks whereas undirected interactions are intensively studied. We establish a voter model in a dynamical directed network. We analytically obtain the degree distribution of the evolving network at any given time. Furthermore, we find that the average degree is captured by an emergent game. On the other hand, we find that the fate of opinions is captured by another emergent game. Beyond expectation, the two emergent games are typically different due to the unidirectionality of the evolving networks. The Nash equilibrium analysis of the two games facilitates us to give the criterion under which the minority opinion with few disciples initially takes over the population eventually for in-group bias. Our work fosters the understanding of opinion dynamics ranging from methodology to research content.</description>

      <title>Homophilic organization of egocentric communities in ICT services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Members of a society can be characterized by a large number of features, such as gender, age, ethnicity, religion, social status, and shared activities. One of the main tie-forming factors between individuals in human societies is homophily, the tendency of being attracted to similar others. Homophily has been mainly studied with focus on one of the features and little is known about the roles of similarities of different origins in the formation of communities. To close this gap, we analyze three datasets from Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services, namely, two online social networks and a network deduced from mobile phone calls, in all of which metadata about individual features are available. We identify communities within egocentric networks and surprisingly find that the larger the community is, the more overlap is found between features of its members and the ego. We interpret this finding in terms of the effort needed to manage the communities; the larger diversity requires more effort such that to maintain a large diverse group may exceed the capacity of the members. As the ego reaches out to her alters on an ICT service, we observe that the first alter in each community tends to have a higher feature overlap with the ego than the rest. Moreover the feature overlap of the ego with all her alters displays a non-monotonic behaviors as a function of the ego's degree. We propose a simple mechanism of how people add links in their egocentric networks of alters that reproduces all the empirical observations and shows the reason behind non-monotonic tendency of the egocentric feature overlap as a function of the ego's degree.</description>

      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Crowd Egress with Environmental Stressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a modeling framework to characterize evacuee response to environmental stimuli during emergency egress. The model is developed in consistency with stress theory, which explains how an organism reacts to environmental stressors. We integrate the theory into the well-known social-force model, and develop a framework to simulate crowd evacuation behavior in multi-compartment buildings. Our method serves as a theoretical basis to study crowd movement at bottlenecks, and simulate their herding and way-finding behavior in normal and hazardous conditions. The pre-movement behavior is also briefly investigated by using opinion dynamics with social group model. The algorithms have been partly tested in FDS+EVAC as well as our simulation platform crowdEgress.</description>

      <title>Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of epidemic spreading, many intricate dynamical patterns can emerge due to the cooperation of different types of pathogens or the interaction between the disease spread and other failure propagation mechanism. To unravel such patterns, simulation frameworks are usually adopted, but they are computationally demanding on big networks and subject to large statistical uncertainty. Here, we study the two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize a dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on such dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

      <title>A simple model of decision-making in the application process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decision-making, individuals often rely on intuition, which can occasionally yield suboptimal outcomes. This study examines the impact of intuitive decision-making on individuals who are confronted with limited position information in the job application process. We propose a measure, the mismatch index, that gauges allocation efficiency by comparing the final application rate to the preset admission rate. By simulation and analytical results, we counter-intuitively find that under the intuitive strategy, acquiring more information does not always lead to more efficient allocation. Additionally, a shift from despondency to a bandwagon effect occurs when the initial application rate surpasses the admission rate, which can be observed in our field experiments. Meanwhile, experimental data also unveil variations in individuals' reliance on intuition, indicating the presence of inherent adventurous and conservative inclinations. To account for these effects, we introduce an enhancement factor into our model. The improved results align well with these real data, showing that compared to mediate competitive scenarios, individuals exhibit a stronger conservative tendency in fierce or less competitive scenarios. These findings offer significant insights into resource allocation, especially in the competitive job market context.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>
