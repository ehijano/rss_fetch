      <title>Invariance Properties of Davydov-Yetter Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Davydov-Yetter (DY) cohomology is a cohomology theory for linear semigroupal (i.e.~monoidal but not necessarily categories and functors, measuring deformations of their coherence isomorphisms. We show that DY cohomology is invariant under freely adjoining a unit object, and under adjoining colimits. This implies that constructions such as Ind-completion and monoidal abelian envelope do not change the cohomology.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of semiorthogonal decompositions in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a smooth and proper morphism $\mathcal{X}\to U$ with quasicompact semiseparated target we associate a sheaf in the \'etale topology, which takes an affine $U$-scheme $V$ to the set of $V$-linear semiorthogonal decompositions (of fixed length) of the category $\operatorname{Perf}\mathcal{X}_V$. We use Artin's criterion to prove that, when $U$ is excellent, this is in fact an algebraic space which is moreover \'etale (though in general non-quasicompact and non-separated) over $U$. We moreover generalise the construction of the sheaf to families of geometric noncommutative schemes in the sense of Orlov. We also define a subfunctor classifying nontrivial semiorthogonal decompositions, and conjecture it is an open and closed subspace.
  Along the way, we prove that for a smooth and proper family of schemes, a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves of a fibre uniquely deforms over an \'etale neighbourhood of the point.</description>

      <title>A Representability Theorem for Stacks in Derived Geometry Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representability theorem for stacks, due to Artin in the underived setting and Lurie in the derived setting, gives conditions under which a stack is representable by an $n$-geometric stack. In recent work of Ben-Bassat, Kelly, and Kremnizer, a new theory of derived analytic geometry has been proposed as geometry relative to the $(\infty,1)$-category of simplicial commutative Ind-Banach $R$-modules, for $R$ a Banach ring. In this paper, we prove a representability theorem which holds in a very general context, which we call a representability context, encompassing both the derived algebraic geometry context of To\"en and Vezzosi and these new derived analytic geometry contexts. The representability theorem gives natural and easily verifiable conditions for checking that derived stacks in these contexts are $n$-geometric, such as having an $n$-geometric truncation, being nilcomplete, and having an obstruction theory. Future work will explore representability of certain moduli stacks arising in derived analytic geometry, for example moduli stacks of Galois representations.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb categories with coloured regions and Jones-Wenzl projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised Temperley-Lieb categories with regions labelled by elements of a commutative algebra were introduced by M. Khovanov and the second author in [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 19 (2023), no. 5]. We consider the case where the regions are labelled by colours, corresponding to a complete set of orthogonal idempotents of a semisimple commutative algebra. We determine when these generalised Temperley-Lieb categories are semisimple and find the direct sum decompositions of tensor products of simple objects. As the main tool we use two-variable versions of Chebychev polynomials and coloured Jones-Wenzl projectors. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of M. Khovanov and the second author on Gram determinants and non-degeneracy of trace pairings for the associated Temperley-Lieb algebras with coloured regions.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Game}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>
