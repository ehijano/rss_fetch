      <title>Symplectization of certain Hamiltonian systems in fibered almost-symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an important difference between Hamiltonian-like vector fields in an almost-symplectic manifold $(M,\sigma)$, compared to the standard case of a symplectic manifold: in the almost-symplectic case, a vector field such that the contraction iX{\sigma} is closed need not be a symmetry of $\sigma$. We thus call partially-Hamiltonian those vector fields which have the former property and fully-Hamiltonian those which have both properties. We consider 2n-dimensional almost symplectic manifolds with a fibration $\pi : M \longrightarrow B$ by Lagrangian tori. Trivially, all vertical partially-Hamiltonian vector fields are fully-Hamiltonian. We investigate the existence and the properties of non-vertical fully-Hamiltonian vector fields. We show that this class is non-empty, but under certain genericity conditions that involve the Fourier spectrum of their Hamiltonian, these vector fields reduce, under a (possibly only semi-globally defined, if $n \ge 4$) torus action, to families of standard symplectic-Hamiltonian vector fields.</description>

      <title>A vanishing theorem in Siefring's intersection theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, R. Siefring introduced a homotopy-invariant generalized intersection number and singularity index for punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, by adding contributions from curve's asymptotic behavior to the standard intersection number and singularity index. In this article, we provide a stratification of the moduli space that describes the rate of asymptotic convergence of the pseudoholomorphic curves. Using this stratification, we provide a more intricate characterization of the curves for which these added contribution to the intersection number and singularity index vanishes. In doing so, we prove that the asymptotic contribution to intersection number and singularity index vanishes under generic perturbations. This means that in generic situations we only need to consider the usual intersections of the curves.</description>

      <title>The Lagrange Problem from the Viewpoint of Toric Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I mainly prove the following conclusions. For the Lagrange problem, when the energy value is below the minimum value of the first, second and third critical points, the toric domain defined for the bounded component of the regularized energy hypersurface is strictly monotone and is dynamically convex as a corollary. For the Euler problem as a special case of the Lagrange problem, When the energy is negative, the toric domain defined for the bounded component near the positive mass of the regularized energy hypersurface with one positive mass and one absolutely smaller non-positive masses is convex. Together with Gabriella Pinzari's result, the toric domain defined above is concave when the second mass is non-negative, convex when the second mass is non-positive.</description>

      <title>Local exotic tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a broad class of symplectic manifolds of dimension at least six, we find the following new phenomenon: there exist local exotic Lagrangian tori. More specifically, let $X$ be a geometrically bounded symplectic manifold of dimension at least six. We show that every open subset of $X$ contains infinitely many Lagrangian tori which are distinct up to symplectomorphisms of $X$ while being Lagrangian isotopic and having the same classical invariants. The proof relies on a locality property of the displacement energy germ, which allows us to compute it in a Darboux chart. Since these tori are not monotone, bubbling may occur and the count of Maslov index two $J$-holomorphic disks does not yield an invariant.</description>
