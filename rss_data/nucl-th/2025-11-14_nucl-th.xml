      <title>Radii of proton emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear radius is a fundamental structural observable that informs many properties of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter. Experimental studies of radii in dripline nuclei are in the forefront of research with radioactive ion beams. Of particular interest are charge radii of proton-unbound nuclei that will soon be approached in laser spectroscopy. In this paper, using the complex-energy approach and direct time propagation, we investigate the radius of the proton resonance whose size is ill-defined in the standard stationary quantum-mechanical description. An early-time plateau is identified during which the radius of the Gamow resonance coincides with the real-energy radius accessible experimentally. We demonstrate a non-monotonic dependence of the complex radius on decay energy and a local increase of the charge radius across the threshold (a proton halo effect).</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on (Anti-)nuclei Production with Pion-Nucleus Femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions provide a unique environment for synthesizing both nuclei and antinuclei (such as $\bar{d}$ and $\overline{^4\text{He}}$) at temperatures ($k_BT\sim100$ MeV) nearly two orders of magnitude above their binding energies of a few MeV. The underlying production mechanism, whether through statistical hadronization, nucleon coalescence, or dynamical regeneration and disintegration, remains unsettled. By solving relativistic kinetic equations for pion-catalyzed reactions for deuteron regeneration and disintegration ($\pi NN \leftrightarrow \pi d$) in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, we find pronounced peaks in the femtoscopic momentum correlations of both $\pi^+-p$ and $\pi^+-d$ pairs. These peak structures originate from the formation of intermediate $\Delta$ (1232) resonances, and their magnitudes agree with recent ALICE measurements when a downward in-medium $\Delta$ mass shift of about 70 MeV/$c^2$ is included. In contrast, the nucleon coalescence model reproduces only about half of the observed peak strength, and the statistical hadronization model predicts no resonance feature. These findings from pion-nucleus femtoscopy provide compelling evidence that pion-catalyzed reactions play a dominant role in the production of light (anti-)nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions and cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Emulation of Proton-Deuteron Scattering via the Reduced Basis Method and Active Learning: Detailed Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleon-deuteron ($Nd$) scattering can be used to constrain three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). However, high-fidelity calculations, such as the Hyperspherical Harmonic (HH) method, are computationally expensive, making it difficult or even prohibitive to explore the vast parameter space of $\chi$EFT\xspace. To address this challenge, specifically for proton-deuteron ($pd$) scattering below the deuteron breakup threshold, we developed model-driven emulators based on the Reduced Basis Method (RBM) and active learning techniques, as presented in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01844}{arXiv:2511.01844}. The method exploits the similarities between solutions at different parameter points to significantly reduce computational costs. In this companion paper, we provide a comprehensive description of our HH-based high-fidelity calculations and implementation of both variational-method-based and Galerkin-projection-based scattering emulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning in the form of greedy algorithms for selecting optimal training points in the parameter space, and the high accuracy and speed of the emulators, for two different nucleon forces and two scattering channels (${1/2}^+$ and ${1/2}^-$). For example, in a two-dimensional parameter space, the relative emulation errors can be reduced to $10^{-7}$ with fewer than 10 training points. Our work paves the way for the efficient calibration of $\chi$EFT\xspace nucleon interactions using Bayesian statistics, and the methodology can be applied to other nuclear scattering processes (including neutron-deuteron scattering), as well as other finite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Friction terms in multi-fluid description of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-fluid description of heavy-ion collisions, the primary scatterings and particle production are described in terms of interaction between fluids, so called friction. These friction terms can be derived from kinetic theory, but they are not unique. We compare different approaches to derive the friction terms, introduce a new ``charge transfer" friction, which allows to move charge to the midrapidity fireball, and implement them in the MUFFIN model. The charge transfer friction is more consistent with the assumption of three fluids clearly separated in momentum space, and allows better comparisons of the experimental data and underlying equation of state. It also leaves room for entropy generation due to dissipation in individual fluids, and we present the first results obtained using viscous multi-fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Resonant Alpha-Induced Neutron-Emission: A Multi- Method Comparison Of Nuclear Reaction Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise calculation of alpha-induced neutron-emission ($\alpha$,n) reaction rates is fundamental to understanding nucleosynthesis in diverse stellar environments. This study investigates the nuclear reaction rates for various non-resonant alpha-induced neutron-emission reactions by employing analytical, theoretical, and computational methods. We have adopted analytical expressions from existing literature, and for the computational approach, we have implemented the Monte Carlo method. To better understand the functionality and validate the established open-source Monte Carlo scripts, we also developed our own computational code and used it to test various aspects of the method. A comprehensive comparison of the reaction rates from each method is presented by plotting their dependency on temperature.</description>

      <title>The Non-thermal Energy Window for Laser-Driven Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical nuclear reaction rates in stellar environments are governed by the Gamow window, where Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and quantum tunneling probabilities combine to produce effective reactivity. However, this conventional formulation is inadequate for the non-thermal ion distributions generated in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework, based on a Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, to evaluate nuclear reaction rates under these non-equilibrium conditions. We identify a new effective energy window and analytical expression of the fusion reactivity distinct from the conventional Gamow window, providing a predictive tool for laboratory astrophysics experiments designed to replicate astrophysical nuclear processes using laser-driven nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Gauged Soft Recursion: On-Shell Construction of Goldstone-Gauge Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new on-shell recursion relation for scattering amplitudes involving Nambu-Goldstone bosons with a gauged unbroken symmetry. A central challenge is that gauge interactions break Adler's zero condition for charged scalars, invalidating the standard soft recursion. To overcome this, we introduce a ``gauged soft recursion'' that leverages the soft theorems of the gauge bosons themselves, combined with a novel decomposition of amplitudes into gauge-invariant components where Adler's zero is partially restored. The formalism, which also incorporates internal gauge bosons via angular momentum constraints, enables the systematic construction of tree-level amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of Goldstone bosons and gauge bosons in both Abelian and non-Abelian theories, as we demonstrate with explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP violation, which involves breaking the combined charge-conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries, is essential for understanding the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It is a key feature of the Standard Model, originating from complex phases in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. Despite the successes of the SM, the amount of CP violation it predicts is not enough to explain baryogenesis, prompting searches for new sources of CP violation in other areas of particle physics. This article offers a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical foundations of C, P, and T symmetries and their combinations. It also emphasizes the importance of CP violation in modern particle physics and how it can be used to explore New Physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gross-Pitaevskii Equation for 2D Bosons with Attractive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for two-dimensional (2D) attractive Bose systems. First, we demonstrate that it accurately captures key properties of universal bound states in free space commonly referred to as quantum droplets. We then apply the framework to predict the existence of universal excited states, including vortex configurations, which may be more accessible to experimental investigation than the ground state. Additionally, we investigate breathing modes and quench dynamics in trapped geometries. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for exploring both static and dynamical phenomena in finite 2D Bose systems, offering guidance for the design of future experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>Possible $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ resonances by solving Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schr\"odinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the particle $f_1(1285)$, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is obtained, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced with different coupling constants fixed with the binding energies of $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$, respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group simultaneously. This method is extended to study the $D \bar{D}^*$ system analogously. When the particle $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is treated as a bound state of $D \bar{D}^*$, the particles $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c \bar{c}}(4020)$ and $X(3940)$ can be obtained as solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, which implies the spin and parity of these particles are all $J^P=1^+$.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics Approach for Extracting and Emulating Continuum Physics Based on Bound-State-Like Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified emulation framework for studying continuum physics in finite quantum systems. Using a reduced basis method, we construct powerful emulators for the inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation that operate in a combined parameter space of complex energy ($E$) and other inputs ($\bm{\theta}$). Within the space, the emulators simultaneously perform analytical continuation in $E$ -- extracting continuum physics from numerically simpler bound-state-like calculations -- and interpolate this entire process across $\bm{\theta}$. This yields a small, non-Hermitian system whose properties (e.g., resonances and scattering observables) can be rapidly predicted for any $\bm{\theta}$. Crucially, the complex-$E$ emulation provides a pathway to compute continuum observables for complex systems where advanced bound-state methods exist but direct continuum calculations are yet to be developed, while the $\bm{\theta}$-emulation enables rapid parameter-space exploration and can be adapted to accelerate other existing continuum calculations. Demonstrations with two- and three-body systems highlight the method's effectiveness and suggest its connection to (near-)optimal rational approximation. This Letter presents the key results, with further details reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, I develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators rapidly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) across a parameter space that includes both complex energy and other real-valued physical inputs in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, one now has a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates those extractions in the input parameter space. Building on a prior Letter [\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309}{[arXiv:2408.03309}], this article provides the full theoretical details, a comprehensive analysis of the method's performance, and a brief discussion of how it can be coupled with existing continuum approaches to perform emulations in their input parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei is set to provide the most stringent test of lepton-flavor symmetry and a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, to disentangle new lepton-flavor-violating interactions, in combination with information from $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to 3e$, it is critical that uncertainties at each step of the analysis be controlled and fully quantified. In this regard, nuclear response functions related to the coupling to neutrons are notoriously problematic, since they are not directly constrained by experiment. We address these shortcomings by combining ab initio calculations with a recently improved determination of charge distributions from electron scattering by exploiting strong correlations among charge, point-proton, and point-neutron radii and densities. We present overlap integrals for $^{27}$Al, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ti including full covariance matrices, allowing, for the first time, for a comprehensive consideration of nuclear structure uncertainties in the interpretation of $\mu\to e$ experiments.</description>

Abstract: We determine the form of dissipative currents at the first order in relativistic spin hydrodynamics with finite chemical potential including gradients of the spin potential. Taking advantage of isotropy in the hydrodynamic local rest frame, using a suitable matching condition for the flow velocity and enforcing the semi-positivity of entropy production, we find 23 dissipative transport coefficients relating dissipative currents to gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields: 4 for the symmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor, 5 for the antisymmetric part, 3 for the conserved vector current, and 11 for the spin tensor. We compare our finding with previous results in literature.</description>

      <title>$g$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>
