      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>

      <title>NGTS-11 c: a transiting Neptune-mass planet interior to the warm Saturn NGTS-11 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of NGTS-11 c, a transiting warm Neptune ($P \approx 12.8$ d; $M_{p} = 1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_{\mathrm{Nep}}$; $R_{p} = 1.24 \pm 0.03 R_{\mathrm{Nep}}$), in an orbit interior to the previously reported transiting warm Saturn NGTS-11 b ($P \approx 35.5$ d). We also find evidence of a third outer companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of NGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from NGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides evidence for a long-period companion ($P &gt; 2300$ d; $M_{p} \sin i &gt; 3.6 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our expanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \pm 0.09 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \pm 0.02 R_{\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than previously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \pm 0.3 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their near-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached their present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably either formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration. A comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple well-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56. Finally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm Jupiters is empirically well supported.</description>

      <title>A formation mechanism for narrow rings around minor bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of narrow rings around minor bodies has raised many questions regarding their origin and current dynamics. Sharp ring boundaries seem indicative of shepherding moonlets, but none have been found. All rings lie close to spin-orbit resonances (SORs) with the central body, particularly the 1/3, even though it is not clear how these may be related. Furthermore, in at least one case the location of the ring is exterior to the Roche radius, adding to the striking differences with respect to giant planets. We study the dynamical evolution of a particle disk around a minor body, perturbed by the non-spherical component of the gravity field, particle collisions, and spin changes of the central mass linked to angular momentum conservation. By varying key parameters, we search for cases where the combined effects may lead to resonance capture and orbital configurations similar to those that have been observed. We performed N-body simulations of massless particles orbiting a central spherical body with a co-rotating mass anomaly. Collisions were modeled by adopting a simple radial damping force. Angular momentum conservation links the body spin to the disk orbital evolution. Since the gravitational effect of the test particles is neglected, this back-reaction is introduced externally assuming ad hoc spin-down rates and disk mass. Interaction between non-sphericity and collisions leads to the formation of a narrow ring that slowly recedes from the central mass. Spin-down of the minor planet shifts the SORs outward, enabling resonant capture. For suitable parameters, a portion -or all- of the initial disk can become trapped in the 1/3 SOR with the mass anomaly, in dynamically stable low-eccentricity orbits. Although the required disk mass is high ($\ge 1\%$ of the central body), long-term collisional erosion could reduce it to values that are consistent with observed ringlets.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Exoplanet Transit Photometry from Space with a 15-mm Aperture Optical Navigation Camera on Hayabusa2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of exoplanet transits by small satellites have gained increasing attention for reducing detection biases. However, no unambiguous detection of an exoplanet has yet been demonstrated using optics with apertures smaller than 60 mm. Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data for ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each event. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The transit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and were consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to within 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an absolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to within 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to the planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated orbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values. ONC-T sets a new record for the smallest-aperture instrument to detect an exoplanet transit from space, advancing the frontier of exoplanet science with miniature instrumentation. Our results suggest that optics as small as ONC-T may be capable of detecting transiting long-period Jupiters: a population that remains underrepresented in current surveys.</description>

      <title>Search for exocomets transits in Kepler light curves: Ten new transits identified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler mission, despite its conclusion over a decade ago, continues to offer a rich dataset for uncovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit signatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach based on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit light curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified candidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to filtering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are presented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog includes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously reported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different host star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain consistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists of 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary transits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries mimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the cometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age distribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This challenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age and underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution of exocometary activity in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Habitability and Biosignature Detection on TOI-700 d: The Role of UV Environment and Atmospheric Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs have long been prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets, owing to their abundance in the galaxy and the relative ease of detecting Earth-sized worlds within their narrower habitable zones. Yet, these low-mass stars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary atmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a relatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to its Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether a habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV flux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios - one analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like environment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate that all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water on the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ substantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the Archean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under intensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the surface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the detection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances the overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth, potentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings underscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature detection and a potential protection of surface habitability.</description>

      <title>Deuterated water ice on the satellites of Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deuterium to hydrogen ratio in water ice in a planetary body carries important information on the history of water processing and delivery in the protostellar nebula. For a giant planet satellite, the D/H ratio is also affected by the processes and temperatures of the circumplanetary or circumstellar environment in which the satellites formed. Here we present robust JWST spectroscopic detections of the 4.14 $\mu$m O-D stretch absorption line (analogous to the 3 $\mu$m water O-H stretch) on the mid-sized Saturnian satellites and use these detections to infer a D/H ratio on each satellite. Within the limitations of the technique, we find that all of the satellites are consistent with having a D/H ratio of about $1.5 \times$ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), which is about an order of magnitude higher than the value of the atmosphere of Saturn. A much higher previously reported D/H ratio for Phoebe is ruled out at the 10$\sigma$ level, and a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 $\times$ VSMOW is obtained. The elevated D/H ratios demonstrate that the solid planetesimals and pebbles that built the satellites never sublimed and re-equilibrated with the gaseous circumplanetary disk. The similarity of the D/H measurements across all satellites suggest that the D/H ratio of water ice in the vicinity of Saturn at the time of satellite formation was also approximately 1.5 $\times$ VSMOW.</description>

      <title>NIRPS and TESS reveal a peculiar system around the M dwarf TOI-756: A transiting sub-Neptune and a cold eccentric giant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) joined HARPS on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla Observatory in April 2023, dedicating part of its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program to the radial velocity follow-up of TESS planet candidates to confirm and characterize transiting planets around M dwarfs. We report the first results of this program with the characterization of the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune candidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting planet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_\oplus$ and a mass of 9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star with a minimum mass of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.11 $M_\mathrm{jup}$. Additionally, a linear trend of 146$~\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is visible in the radial velocities, hinting at a third component, possibly in the planetary or brown dwarf regime. This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the first confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf. With a density of 2.42 $\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is a volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an atmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is well constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra. It falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower boundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future atmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this population.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the Class I protostar L1489 IRS with NOEMA - II. A disk replenished by a massive streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Streamers are newly identified channels that transport mass from large, molecular-cloud scales down to small, protoplanetary-disk scales. To better understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study their physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to characterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within the Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to the young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H, ortho-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and 2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine structure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new self-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the non-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those molecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled us to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk} system's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of $\geq(4.67-18.3)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ (i.e., $\geq0.65-2.57$ times the current disk mass) and an infall rate of $\geq(1.94-7.57)\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular tracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I objects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer material. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external warped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations. Moreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and HC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may be inherited from the core. These results suggest, for the first time, that the chemical composition of a Class I object is [...]</description>

      <title>Recursive Target Body Approach for Low-Thrust Multiple Gravity-Assist Sequence Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to automate the design of Multiple Gravity-Assist (MGA) transfers between planets using low-thrust propulsion. In particular, during the preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of MGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require extensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel optimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body Approach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory representation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to automate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs the optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent gravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this work is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized Island Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further increase the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter transfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference problem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s $\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA trajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory optimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is consistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In conclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary optimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories.</description>

      <title>Influence of kinetic effects in large-scale magnetic reconnection with multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \sim 100 \lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>

      <title>A new photometric ephemeris for the 2M1510 AB double brown dwarf eclipsing binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipsing brown dwarfs are important calibrators of sub-stellar evolution models used to infer the characteristics of directly imaged brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. Only two double brown dwarf eclipsing binary systems are known, among them 2MASS J15104786-2818174 (2M1510 AB), published in 2020 with a poorly constrained orbital period. Here we analyse TESS full-frame image (FFI) photometry of this faint ($T=15.9$) binary and detect a significant (${&gt;}10\sigma$) periodic signal spanning TESS Cycles 1-7, consistent with previous data. We refine the orbital period to $20.897782 \pm 0.000036$ d, reducing its present-day uncertainty from 18 h to 8 min. Our work is crucial for scheduling follow-up observations of this system for detailed study with other photometric facilities. We also find that a recent orbital solution from Doppler data is inconsistent with existing photometry. A timing offset in the Doppler data may have produced a spurious signal mimicking retrograde apsidal precession, from which the claimed circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb was inferred. From our best attempt at correcting the data we were unable to reconcile the radial velocity data with the photometry, suggesting that the radial velocity uncertainties are underestimated, and that the circumbinary planet 2M1510 ABb may be a false positive.</description>

      <title>Exomoons of Circumbinary Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confirmation of the first exomoon remains elusive. Although several exomoon candidates exist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around circumbinary planets (CBPs). Most circumbinary planets are thought to form far from the host binary and migrate through the protoplanetary disc. Therefore, an exomoon of a CBP represents a fascinating yet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would shed light on the robustness of moon formation and evolution in dynamically active planetary systems. In this work, we simulate the orbital evolutions of exomoons around migrating CBPs. We show that for fully migrated CBPs, a moon is capable of surviving the migration if it is formed within $\sim5-10\%$ of the planet's Hill Radius, well within the currently proposed range at which moons are thought to settle in the planetary disc for giant planets. Even though all known CBPs are gas giants, 18\% of the surviving moons in our sample are within the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary habitability, albeit hosted by moons rather than planets. $38\%$ of moons escape their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs (i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). Nearly one-third of exomoons collide with their host planet, and $1\%$ are ejected from the system entirely. This last class presents another pathway for producing free-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and expected from the Roman microlensing survey.</description>

      <title>A revision of the lifetime of submoons: tidal dynamics with the Euler-Lagrange equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submoons, moons orbiting other moons, may be exotic environments capable of hosting extraterrestrial life. We extend previous studies to revise the maximum lifetime of these objects due to planetary, lunar and sublunar tidal migration.
  Using the Euler-Lagrange equation with a tidal dissipation process as specified by the Constant Geometric Lag model, we derive and solve the governing equations numerically to map the semi-major axis parameter space for star-planet-moon-submoon systems in which the submoon could be massive enough to host life.
  We find that Earth could have hosted asteroid-sized submoons ($\sim10^{15}\mathrm{kg}$), whereas a submoon near the previously proposed upper limit ($\sim4.6\cdot10^{17}\mathrm{kg}$) would have driven the Moon $\sim30\%$ farther from Earth than its current orbit.
  A Warm Jupiter system like Kepler1625 has greater potential of hosting a massive submoon. We found that a submoon of around $10\%M_{\text{Luna}}$ could survive if Kepler1625b's hypothesized moon were $68\%$ farther away then what the best-fit model suggests ($67R_{\mathrm{p}}$ instead of $40R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Giant submoons of mass $1.8M_{\oplus}$ are stable in a Kepler1625-like system. In these cases, the moon orbit is wide ($&gt; 100R_{\mathrm{p}}$). Decreasing the submoon mass to a habitability prerequisite of $0.5M_{\oplus}$, likely needed for a stable atmosphere and plate tectonics, leads to a smaller total number of stable iterations relative to the $m_{sm}=1.8M_{\oplus}$ case.
  In fact, we identified a minimum number of stable iterations on intermediate submoon mass-scales of around $0.1M_{\oplus}$. This is likely due to an interplay between small tidal forces at small submoon masses and small Roche-Limits at very high submoon masses. If submoon formation pathways in Warm Jupiter systems prefer such intermediate mass-scales, habitable submoons could be a rare phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On The Orbital Evolution of Multiple Wide Super-Jupiters: How Disk Migration and Dispersal Shape the Stability of The PDS 70 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct imaging has revealed exoplanet systems hosting multiple wide-orbit Super-Jupiters, where planet-planet interactions can shape their long-term dynamical evolution. These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The $\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive ($&gt;$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($&gt;$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only $\lesssim 4\%$ of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate "PDS 70 d", finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in $&lt;$ 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>
