      <title>Multivariable $p$-adic Hodge theory for products of Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explain how to attach to a family of $p$-adic representations of a product of Galois groups an overconvergent family of multivariable $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, generalizing results from Pal-Zabradi and Carter-Kedlaya-Zabradi, using Colmez-Sen-Tate descent. We also define rings of multivariable crystalline and semistable periods, and explain how to recover this multivariable $p$-adic theory attached to a family of representations from its multivariable $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-module. We also explain how our framework allows us to recover the main results of Brinon-Chiarellotto-Mazzari on multivariable $p$-adic Galois representations.</description>

      <title>On the Mordell-Weil rank of certain CM abelian varieties over anticyclotomic towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be an imaginary quadratic extension, and let $p$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we investigate the growth of Mordell-Weil ranks of CM abelian varieties associated with Hecke characters over $K$ of infinite type $(1, 0)$ along the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-anticyclotomic tower of $K$. Our results cover all decomposition types of $p$ in $K$.
  The analytic aspect of our proof is based on our computations of the local and global root numbers of Hecke characters, together with a recent generalization by H. Jia of D. Rohrlich's result concerning the relation between the vanishing orders of Hecke $L$-functions and their root numbers. The arithmetic conclusions then follow from the Gross-Zagier formula and the Kolyvagin machinery.</description>

      <title>Spivey's type recurrence relation for degenerate Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive a recurrence relation for the degenerate Bell polynomials by using the operators X and D satisfying the commutation relation DX-XD=1. Here X is the `multiplication by x' operator and D=d/dx. This recurrence relation is a generalization of Spivey's recurrence relation for the Bell numbers. We also obtain a recurrence relation for the degenerate r--Bell polynomials by using the same operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (x_n; n\in Z) be a bisequence of elements x_n in the 1-dimensional torus R/Z, which is called a stream over R/Z. Let P(z)=a_k z^k+...+a_1 z+a_0 be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Define the set of streams over R/Z such that the convolution product P(z)\times(x_n; n\in Z)=(\sum_{i=0}^k a_i x_{n-i}; n\in Z)=(0; n\in Z), which is called the stream 0 of P. We study similarities between stream 0 of P and the roots of P(z)=0.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via solutions of refinement equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime~$n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D.Klarner on Erd\"os question about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>On Ruzsa's conjecture on congruence preserving functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruzsa's conjecture asserts that any sequence $(a_n)_{n \geq 0}$ of integers that preserves congruences, $\textit{i.e.}$, satisfies $ a_{n+k} \equiv a_n \mod k $, and has the growth condition $\limsup_{n \to +\infty} |a_n|^{1/n} &lt; e$, must be a polynomial sequence. While previous results by Hall, Ruzsa, Perelli, and Zannier have confirmed this conjecture under stricter growth bounds, the general case remains open. In this paper, we establish a new partial result by proving that if in addition the generating series $ f = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n x^n $ has at most two singular directions at $ x = 0 $, then $(a_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is necessarily a polynomial sequence. Our approach is based on an adaptation of Carlson's method, originally developed for the P\'olya-Carlson dichotomy, combined with a refined analysis of Hankel determinants. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on these determinants using P\'olya's inequality and a transfinite diameter argument of Dubinin, while a non-Archimedean divisibility condition on Hankel determinants yields a lower bound, ultimately leading to the rationality of $ f $. This confirms that counterexamples to Ruzsa's conjecture, if they exist, must exhibit at least three singular directions.</description>

      <title>The u-invariant of function fields in one variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The u-invariant of a field is the largest dimension of an anisotropic quadratic torsion form over the field. In this article we obtain a bound on the u-invariant of function fields in one variable over a henselian valued field with arbitrary value group and with residue field of characteristic different from 2. This generalises a theorem due to Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen and its extension due to Scheiderer. Their result covers the special case where the valuation is discrete.</description>

      <title>Fixed perimeter analogues of some partition results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euler's partition identity states that the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. Strikingly, Straub proved in 2016 that this identity also holds when counting partitions of any size with largest hook (perimeter) $n$. This has inspired further investigation of partition identities and inequalities in the fixed perimeter setting. Here, we explore fixed perimeter analogues of some well-known partition results inspired by Euler's partition identity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions G, H and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via G(0) = 0 and then G(n) = n -G(G(n -1)). Following Hofstadter, a family (F\_k) of similar functions is obtained by varying the number k of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions F\_k . In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions F k are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial X^k -X^(k-1) -1. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function F\_k , i.e., the maximal distance between F\_k and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when k $\le$ 4. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions F\_3 and F\_4 are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover F\_k can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when k $\le$ 2, while F\_k is almost additive exactly when k $\le$ 4. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of F\_3 .</description>

      <title>Density of shapes of periodic tori in the cubic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the compact orbits of the $\mathbb{R}^2$ action of the diagonal group on $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, the so-called periodic tori. For any periodic torus, the set of periods of the orbit forms a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Such a lattice, re-scaled to covolume one, gives a shape point in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$.
  We prove that the shapes of all periodic tori are dense in $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This implies the density of shapes of the unit groups of totally real cubic orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.08205v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve existing explicit bounds of Vinogradov-Korobov type for zero-free regions of the Riemann zeta function, both for large height t and for every t. A primary input is an explicit bound of the author (Proc. London Math. Soc. 85 (2002), 565-633) for the growth of $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ for $\sigma$ near 1. Another ingredient is a kind of Jensen formula (Lemma 2.2) relating the growth of a function on vertical lines to a weighted count of its zeros inside a vertical strip. The latter was used recently in the weak subconvexity work of Soundararajan and Thorner (arXiv:1804.03654, Duke Math. J. 168, no. 7 (2019), 1231-1268).</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory for quadratic Hilbert modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Iwasawa main conjecture for quadratic Hilbert modular forms over the p-cyclotomic tower. Using an Euler system in the cohomology of Siegel modular varieties, we prove the "Kato divisibility" of the Iwasawa main conjecture under certain technical hypotheses. By comparing this result with the opposite divisibility due to Wan, we obtain the full Main Conjecture over the cyclotomic Zp-extension. As a consequence, we prove new cases of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for quadratic Hilbert modular forms, and of the equivariant Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in analytic rank 0 for elliptic curves over real quadratic fields twisted by Dirichlet characters.
  As a "by-product" of the theory developed here, we also present new results on Iwasawa theory for Rankin--Selberg convolutions of modular forms, relaxing hypotheses of $p$-distinction or $p$-regularity assumed in previous works. This gives new cases of the equivariant BSD conjecture for elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$ twisted by 2-dimensional odd Artin representations, giving finiteness of the $p$-part of the Tate--Shafarevich group for all but finitely many ordinary primes.</description>

      <title>The structure of Selmer groups and the Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12159v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a new and refined application of (a weaker statement than) the Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves to the structure of Selmer groups of elliptic curves of arbitrary rank. For a large class of elliptic curves, we obtain the following arithmetic consequences.
  1. Kato's Kolyvagin systems is non-trivial. It is the cyclotomic analogue of the Kolyvagin conjecture.
  2. The structure of Selmer groups of elliptic curves over the rationals is completely determined in terms of certain modular symbols. It is a structural refinement of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
  3. The rank zero $p$-converse, the $p$-parity conjecture, and a new upper bound of the ranks of elliptic curves are obtained.
  4. The conjecture of Kurihara on the semi-local description of mod $p$ Selmer groups is confirmed.
  5. An application of the $p$-adic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to the structure of Iwasawa modules is discussed.</description>

      <title>On powers of the diophantine function $\star:x\mapsto x(x+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat the functions $\star^k:{\mathbf N}\rightarrow{\mathbf N}$ where $\star:x\mapsto \star x := x(x+1)$. The set $\{\star^k x+1: \{x,k\}\subseteq{\mathbf N}\}$ is pairwise coprime; so, the set ${\mathbf P}$ of primes is infinite. Our Theorem 4 resorts to the mother sequence, M, that is obtained by factoring the infinite sequence $2,3,4,5,\ldots$ into prime powers.
  For each $x\ge1$ we define the gross $x$-sequence, $\gamma_\star(x) := \langle x+1; \star x+1; \star^2x+1; \star^3x+1;\ldots\rangle$, and also the star sequence, $x^\star$, obtained by factoring the terms of $\gamma_\star(x)$ into prime powers. It turns out that $\gamma_\star(1)$ is Sylvester's sequence, A00058 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, OEIS, and that $\gamma_\star(2)$ is the sequence A082732 in the OEIS.
  Theorem 3. For every integer $x\ge1$ there is a prime $p(x)$ that divides no member of $\{\star^kx+1: k\ge0\}$.
  Theorem 4. For each sequence $\eta$ of powers of primes there are infinitely many subsequences $c$ of M such that numerically $\eta=c_j$ but where the term-set family in M of those $c_j$ is formally. pairwise disjoint.
  Theorem 6. $1/x = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(\star^kx+1) + 1/(\star^nx) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 1/(\star^kx+1)$ for all $\{x,n\}\subseteq{\mathbf N}$.
  Theorem 7. For every $x\in{\mathbf N}$, when $x^\star := \langle x_j\rangle_{j=0}^\infty$ then $\sum_{j=0}^\infty 1/x_j = \infty$.</description>

      <title>Initial layer of the anti-cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_3$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m})$ and capitulation phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-m})$ be an imaginary quadratic field. We consider the properties of capitulation of the p-class group of k in the anti-cyclotomic Zp-extension k^acyc of k; for this, using a new method based on the Log\_p-function (Theorems 1.3and 2.3), we determine, for p = 3, the first layer k\_1^acyc of k^acyc over k, and we examine if, at least, some partial capitulation may exist in k\_1^acyc. The answer is obviously yes, even when k^acyc/k is totally ramified. We have conjectured that this phenomenon of capitulation is specific of all the Zp-extensions of k, distinct from the cyclotomic one. We characterize a sub-family of fields k (Normal Split cases) for which k^acyc is not linearly disjoint from the Hilbert class field (Theorem 3.1). No assumptions are made on the structure of the 3-class group of k, nor on the splitting of 3 in k and in its mirror field k*=Q($\sqrt$3m). Four pari/gp programs are given with numerical illustrations to cover all cases without any limitation.</description>

      <title>Classification of torsion of elliptic curves over quartic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a quartic field $K$. By the Mordell-Weil theorem, $E(K)$ is a finitely generated group. We determine all the possibilities for the torsion group $E(K)_{tor}$ where $K$ ranges over all quartic fields $K$ and $E$ ranges over all elliptic curves over $K$. We show that there are no sporadic torsion groups, or in other words, that all torsion groups either do not appear or they appear for infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves $E$.
  Proving this requires showing that numerous modular curves $X_1(m,n)$ have no non-cuspidal degree $4$ points. We deal with almost all the curves using one of 3 methods: a method for the rank 0 cases requiring no computation; the Hecke sieve, a local method requiring computer-assisted computations; and the global method, an argument for the positive rank cases also requiring no computation. We deal with the handful of remaining cases using ad hoc methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence of $\Omega(n)$ and $\Omega(n+1)$ along logarithmic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega(n)$ denote the number of prime factors of a positive integer $n$ counted with multiplicities. We show that for any bounded functions $a,b\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}$, $$\frac{1}{\log{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{a(\Omega(n))b(\Omega(n+1))}{n} = \Bigg(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N a(\Omega(n))\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N b(\Omega(n))\Bigg) + \mathrm{o}_{N\to\infty}(1).$$ This generalizes a theorem of Tao on the logarithmically averaged two-point correlation Chowla conjecture. Our result is quantitative and the explicit error term that we obtain establishes double-logarithmic savings. As an application, we obtain new results about the distribution of $\Omega(p+1)$ as $p$ ranges over $\ell$-almost primes for a "typical" value of $\ell$.</description>

      <title>On the average least negative Hecke eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the first sign change of Hecke eigenvalues of classical newforms has a finite mean, which we also compute. We distinguish between the first negative prime Hecke eigenvalue, and the first negative Hecke eigenvalue. This problem can be considered to be an analogue of the least quadratic non-residue problem, of which the average was explored by Erd\H{o}s in 1961. In fact, the average least negative prime Hecke eigenvalue has the same value as the average least quadratic non-residue, under GRH. To compute these averages, we develop large sieve inequalities that are uniform in both the weight and level aspect.</description>

      <title>Torsion points and concurrent exceptional curves on del Pezzo surfaces of degree one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blow-up of the anticanonical base point on a del Pezzo surface $S$ of degree 1 gives rise to a rational elliptic surface $\mathscr{E}$ with only irreducible fibers. The sections of minimal height of $\mathscr{E}$ are in correspondence with the $240$ exceptional curves on $S$. A natural question arises when studying the configuration of these curves: if a point on $S$ is contained in 'many' exceptional curves, it is torsion on its fiber on $\mathscr{E}$? In 2005, Kuwata proved for the analogous question on del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$, where there are 56 exceptional curves, that if 'many' equals $4$ or more, the answer is yes. In this paper, we prove that for del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1, the answer is yes if 'many' equals $9$ or more. Moreover, we give counterexamples where a \textsl{non}-torsion point lies in the intersection of $7$ exceptional curves. We give partial results for the still open case of 8 intersecting exceptional curves.</description>

      <title>A construction of the polylogarithm motive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical polylogarithms give rise to a variation of mixed Hodge-Tate structures on the punctured projective line $S=\mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}$, which is an extension of the symmetric power of the Kummer variation by a trivial variation. By results of Beilinson-Deligne, Huber-Wildeshaus, and Ayoub, this polylogarithm variation has a lift to the category of mixed Tate motives over $S$, whose existence is proved by computing the corresponding space of extensions in both the motivic and the Hodge settings. In this paper, we construct the polylogarithm motive as an explicit relative cohomology motive, namely that of the complement of the hypersurface $\{1-zt_1\cdots t_n=0\}$ in affine space $\mathbb{A}^n_S$ relative to the union of the hyperplanes $\{t_i=0\}$ and $\{t_i=1\}$.</description>

      <title>Fast Multiplication and the PLWE-RLWE Equivalence for an Infinite Family of Maximal Real Subfields of Cyclotomic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence between the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) and the Polynomial Learning With Errors (PLWE) problems for the maximal totally real subfield of the $2^r 3^s$-th cyclotomic field for $r \geq 3$ and $s \geq 1$. Moreover, we describe a fast algorithm for computing the product of two elements in the ring of integers of these subfields. This multiplication algorithm has quasilinear complexity in the dimension of the field, as it makes use of the fast Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Our approach assumes that the two input polynomials are given in a basis of Chebyshev-like polynomials, in contrast to the customary power basis. To validate this assumption, we prove that the change of basis from the power basis to the Chebyshev-like basis can be computed with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ arithmetic operations, where $n$ is the problem dimension. Finally, we provide a heuristic and theoretical comparison of the vulnerability to some attacks for the $p$-th cyclotomic field versus the maximal totally real subextension of the $4p$-th cyclotomic field for a reasonable set of parameters of cryptographic size.</description>
