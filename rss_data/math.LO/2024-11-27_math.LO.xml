      <title>Effectiveness and strong graph indivisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relational structure is \emph{strongly indivisible} if for every partition $M = X_0 \sqcup X_1$, the induced substructure on $X_0$ or $X_1$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$. Cameron (1997) showed that a graph is strongly indivisible if and only if it is the complete graph, the completely disconnected graph, or the random graph. We analyze the strength of Cameron's theorem using tools from computability theory and reverse mathematics. We show that Cameron's theorem is is effective up to computable presentation, and give a partial result towards showing that the full theorem holds in the $\omega$-model $\mathsf{REC}$. We also establish that Cameron's original proof makes essential use of the stronger induction scheme $\mathsf{I}\Sigma^0_2$.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the course of proving a tenability result about the probabilities of conditionals, van Fraassen (1976) introduced a semantics for conditionals based on omega-sequences of worlds, which amounts to a particularly simple special case of ordering semantics for conditionals. On that semantics, 'If p, then q' is true at an omega-sequence just in case q is true at the first tail of the sequence where p is true (if such a tail exists). This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, its logic has never been explored. We axiomatize the logic of omega-sequence semantics, showing that it is the result of adding two new axioms to Stalnaker's logic C2: one, Flattening, which is prima facie attractive, and, and a second, Sequentiality, which is complex and difficult to assess, but, we argue, likely invalid. But we also show that when sequence semantics is generalized from omega-sequences to arbitrary (transfinite) ordinal sequences, the result is a more attractive logic that adds only Flattening to C2. We also explore the logics of a few other interesting restrictions of ordinal sequence semantics. Finally, we address the question of whether sequence semantics is motivated by probabilistic considerations, answering, pace van Fraassen, in the negative.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give characterizations of the set of $\Pi^1_{e}$-consequences, $\Sigma^1_{e}$-consequences and $\mathsf{B}(\Pi^1_{e})$-consequences of
  the axiomatic system of the strong dependent choice for $\Sigma^1_i$ formulas $\Sigma^1_i$-$\mathsf{SDC}_0$ for $i &gt; 0$ and $e &lt; i+2$.
  Here, $\mathsf{B}(\Gamma)$ denotes the set generated by $\land,\lor,\lnot$ starting from $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Weak compactness cardinals for strong logics and subtlety properties of the class of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor, we characterize the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics through combinatorial properties of the class of ordinals. This analysis is then used to show that, in contrast to the existence of strong compactness cardinals, the existence of weak compactness cardinals for abstract logics does not imply the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal. More precisely, it is proven that the existence of a proper class of subtle cardinals is consistent with the axioms of ZFC if and only if it is not possible to derive the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals from the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics. Complementing this result, it is shown that the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics implies that unboundedly many ordinals are strongly inaccessible in the inner model HOD of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Baire class functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be an uncountable cardinal such that $2^{&lt; \lambda } = \lambda$. Working in the setup of generalized descriptive set theory, we study the structure of $\lambda^+$-Borel measurable functions with respect to various kinds of limits, and isolate a suitable notion of $\lambda$-Baire class $\xi$ function. Among other results, we provide higher analogues of two classical theorems of Lebesgue, Hausdorff, and Banach, namely:
  (1) A function is $\lambda^+$-Borel measurable if and only if it can be obtained from continuous functions by iteratively applying pointwise $D$-limits, where $D$ varies among directed sets of size at most $\lambda$.
  (2) A function is of $\lambda$-Baire class $\xi$ if and only if it is $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{0}_{\xi+1}$-measurable.</description>

      <title>Measure doubling in unimodular locally compact groups and quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a (possibly discrete) unimodular locally compact group $G$ with Haar measure $\mu_G$, and a compact $A\subseteq G$ of positive measure with $\mu_G(A^2)\leq K\mu_G(A)$. Let $H$ be a closed normal subgroup of G and $\pi: G \rightarrow G/H$ be the quotient map. With the further assumption that $A= A^{-1}$, we show $$\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^2 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A).$$ We also demonstrate that $K^2$ cannot be replaced by $(1-\epsilon)K^2$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.
  In the general case (without $A=A^{-1}$), we show $\mu_{G/H}(\pi A ^2) \leq K^3 \mu_{G/H}(\pi A)$, improving an earlier result by An, Jing, Zhang, and the third author. Moreover, we are able to extract a compact set $B\subseteq A$ with $\mu_G(B)&gt; \mu_G(A)/2$ such that $ \mu_{G/H}(\pi B^2) &lt; 2K \mu_{G/H}(\pi B)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the class of ultrafilters $U$ over countable sets for which $U\cdot U\equiv_T U$, extending several results from \cite{Dobrinen/Todorcevic11}. In particular, we prove that for each countable ordinal $\alpha\geq 2$, the generic ultrafilter $G_\alpha$ forced by $P(\omega^\alpha)/\text{fin}^{\otimes\alpha}$ satisfy $G_\alpha\cdot G_\alpha\equiv_T G_\alpha$. This answers a question posed in \cite[Question 43]{Dobrinen/Todorcevic11}. Additionally, we establish that Milliken-Taylor ultrafilters possess the property that $U\cdot U\equiv_T U$.</description>

      <title>Stone-Gelfand duality for metrically complete lattice-ordered groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Yosida's 1941 version of Stone-Gelfand duality to metrically complete unital lattice-ordered groups that are no longer required to be real vector spaces. This calls for a generalised notion of compact Hausdorff space whose points carry an arithmetic character to be preserved by continuous maps. The arithmetic character of a point is (the complete isomorphism invariant of) a metrically complete additive subgroup of the real numbers containing $1$, namely, either $\frac{1}{n}\mathbb{Z}$ for an integer $n = 1, 2, \dots$, or the whole of $\mathbb{R}$. The main result needed to establish the extended duality theorem is a substantial generalisation of Urysohn's Lemma to such "arithmetic" compact Hausdorff spaces. The original duality is obtained by considering the full subcategory of spaces whose each point is assigned the entire group of real numbers. In the introduction we indicate motivations from and connections with the theory of dimension groups.</description>
