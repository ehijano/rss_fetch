      <title>On the symplectic capacity and mean width of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider two topics involving the relationship between the symplectic capacity and the mean width of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. We first describe an alternative path from the symplectic Brunn-Minkowski inequality of Artstein-Avidan and Ostrover to another inequality, established by the same authors, that relates the capacity and mean width of convex bodies. This new path is less direct but it relates these inequalities to the quermassintegrals of convex bodies and to the local version of Viterbo's conjecture established by Abbondandolo and Benedetti for domains sufficiently close to the ball.
  We then consider the problem of identifying convex bodies whose mean width cannot be decreased by natural classes of symplectomorphisms. We state a conjectured characterization of convex bodies whose mean width is already minimal among all their symplectic images. To test this conjecture we identify a simple class of quadratic convex bodies whose mean width can not be decreased by linear symplectic maps near the identity. We then identify a subset of these examples that fail to satisfy the toric conditions of the conjecture, and show that one can find a nonlinear symplectomorphism that decreases their mean width.</description>

      <title>Symplectic excision and distance rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider various notions of completeness in symplectic topology and ask two related questions. Does a complete open symplectic manifold remain complete after excising a subset? Can two sets be made arbitrarily far apart by adjusting the almost complex structure within an appropriate class of complete almost complex structures? We find rigidity phenomena when the excised set is a symplectic hypersurface. These arise from certain open Gromov-Witten invariants. We contrast this with flexibility that often occurs when the excised set is coisotropic. We also briefly touch on the opposite question of obstructions to existence of a complete symplectic structure compatible with a given complex structure. For the notion of completeness we first consider the traditional notion of geometric boundedness. We then introduce a broader notion of normalized completeness, related to the notion of intermittent boundedness of \cite{GromanFloerOpen}, which depends on $C^0$ properties and is a contractible condition. Finally we speculate about the relation to a Fukaya-categorical notion of completeness.</description>

      <title>Motivic invariants of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and bundles with connections: results and speculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some results and techniques from our papers devoted to the computation of motivic classes of stacks of parabolic Higgs budles and bundles with connections on a curve. In the last section we present some directions for future work, as well as some speculations. The latter include a generalization of the P=W conjecture inspired by the work of Maxim Kontsevich and the third author on the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence for complex symplectic manifolds as well as our running project on the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of nilpotent pairs on the formal disk and geometric Satake correspondence for double affine Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity of log Gromov--Witten Invariants: the mirror to $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modularity properties of generating series of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants of elliptic fibrations relative to singular fibers. Motivated by predictions from Vafa-Witten theory, we conjecture that such generating series are mock modular forms. We prove this conjecture for a large class of invariants of the rational elliptic surface mirror to $\mathbb{P}^2$, relative to a cycle of nine rational curves. The proof uses a correspondence between log Gromov-Witten invariants of the mirror and Vafa-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^2$ established in previous work joint with Bousseau, together with known mock modularity results on the Vafa-Witten side.</description>

      <title>Polytopes and $C^0$-Riemannian metrics with positive $h_{\rm top}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Reeb dynamics on starshaped hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ arising as smoothings of convex polytopes. Using the $C^0$--stability of positive topological entropy for Reeb flows in dimension three from our joint work with Dahinden and Pirnapasov, we show that there exist starshaped polytopes $P$ such that for any starshaped smoothing of $\partial P$ the associated Reeb flows have positive topological entropy. This answers a question of Ostrover and Ginzburg.
  Similarly, we show that given a closed surface $M$ and a number $C&gt;0$, there exist continuous and non-differentiable Riemannian metrics $g$ on $S$ with $h_{\rm top}&gt;C$ in the sense that for any smoothing of $g$ the associated geodesic flows have $h_{\rm top}&gt;C$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study convex bodies in $\RR^{2n}$ with the property that their mean width cannot be infinitesimally decreased by symplectomorphisms. The common theme of our results is that toric symmetry is a preferred feature of convex bodies with this property.</description>

      <title>The partial derivative of ratios of Schur polynomials and applications to symplectic quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a ratio of Schur polynomials $s_{\lambda}/s_{\rho}$ associated to partitions $\lambda$ and $\rho$ such that $\lambda\subsetneq\rho$ has a negative partial derivative at any point where all variables are positive. This is accomplished by establishing an injective map between sets of pairs of skew semistandard Young tableaux that preserves the product of the corresponding monomials. We use this result and the description of the first Laurent coefficient of the Hilbert series of the graded algebra of regular functions on a linear symplectic quotient by the circle to demonstrate that many such symplectic quotients are not graded regularly diffeomorphic. In addition, we give an upper bound for this Laurent coefficient in terms of the largest two weights of the circle representation and demonstrate that all but finitely many circle symplectic quotients of each dimension are not graded regularly diffeomorphic to linear symplectic quotients by $\operatorname{SU}_2$.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate mixed maps and contact structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of real analytic maps $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^k$, where $n &gt; k$, regarded as mixed maps, defined below. Firstly, we give two natural families of mixed isolated complete intersection singularities, called mixed ICIS, which are interesting on their own. We consider the notion of (partial) non-degeneracy for mixed maps; we prove that these define mixed ICIS and that, under suitable conditions, admit a local Milnor fibration. Then, building on previous constructions due to Oka, we obtain natural contact structures and adapted open books on a particular class of mixed links. Finally, we look at mixed links that are diffeomorphic to holomorphic ones, and we address the problem of comparing different contact structures.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Dolgachev-Nikulin-Pinkham mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, we study its analogue for abelian surfaces. In this paper, we introduce lattice-polarized abelian surfaces and construct their coarse moduli spaces. We then construct stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces for abelian surfaces and show that these two spaces are naturally identified for mirror pairs. We also introduce a natural involution on stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces which, under mirror symmetry, pairs abelian surfaces and their duals. Finally, we determine conditions for the existence of mirror partners and classify self-mirror abelian surfaces via their N\'eron-Severi lattices.</description>
