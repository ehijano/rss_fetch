      <title>Unifying Lyapunov exponents with probabilistic uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyaponuv exponent is well-known in deterministic dynamical systems as a measure for quantifying chaos and detecting coherent regions in physically evolving systems. In this Letter, we show how the Lyapunov exponent can be unified with stochastic sensitivity (which quantifies the uncertainty of an evolving uncertain system whose initial condition is certain) within a finite time uncertainty quantification framework in which both the dynamics and the initial condition of a continuously evolving $ n $-dimensional state variable are uncertain.</description>

      <title>Learning tapestries, a statistical learning substrate for open chaotic systems measured with error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of statistical inference for open chaotic systems measured with error is complicated by the interaction of the uncertainty introduced by chaos, and the various sources of random or external variation. Here a method of representing measured data from large open chaotic systems subject to error as collections of threads of plausible pseudo future histories to enable statistical analysis is described. This representation provides asymptotically consistent predictive distributions, for use in developing predictive likelihood methods which: 1. provide a framework for variable selection, 2. provide a framework for Bayesian updating, so for example 4 season ahead predictions learn naturally as the 3rd season ahead is measured. 3. allows examination of conditional scenarios along the future histories for planning purposes. 4. allows the ranking of variable, delay combinations with higher signal to noise ratio.
  The method is tested for learning and variable selection by examining its behavior in predicting 9 years across 4 seasons of climate variables, including local temperature and rainfall measurements at two locations, predicting up to 4 seasons ahead.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>
