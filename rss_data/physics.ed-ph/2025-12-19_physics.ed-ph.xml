      <title>Macroscopic Brownian Motion on a Chaotic Fluid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion is the erratic motion of an object due to collisions with the fluid in which it is immersed. In this work, we detail a tabletop laboratory demonstration of underdamped Brownian motion wherein a macroscopic particle resting on a driven fluid interface exhibits ballistic motion at short times and diffusive motion at long times. We observe the trajectory of a millimetric disk driven by a field of chaotic Faraday waves excited by a shaker. The crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion occurs at time and length scales experimentally accessible through particle tracking of a video recorded with a standard phone camera. Along with representative data, we provide a complete assembly guide, and operating procedure for students so that the experiment can be readily applied in the classroom. The tabletop setup can also be adapted for other student projects and active research topics relating to particle motion on a vibrating fluid interface.</description>

      <title>Share, Rotate, Split: The Effects of Group Work Role Distributions on Student Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Education literature recommends many different strategies for structuring student group work in labs. Many of these strategies, however, have not been sufficiently evaluated for their effects on student outcomes. One prior study suggested that sharing roles, rather than splitting roles, in lab groups can boost students' physics interest and self-efficacy. Here, we expand upon this literature by evaluating the effects of a broader range of role distributions across several student outcomes from a large sample at two different institutions. We developed a survey item to probe the ways students distribute their roles in lab groups. The item asks for the percent of time in lab they spent working together on lab roles (sharing), working alone on roles but rotating each session (rotating), and working alone in the same role throughout the semester (splitting). We employed hierarchical linear modeling to measure the effects of these role distributions on student critical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived agency, belonging, and sense of recognition based on survey items specific to physics lab contexts. We found that role distributions did not differentially impact student critical thinking. We also found that sharing roles tended to have a positive impact on student attitudes; splitting had a negative effect on attitudes; and rotating fell in between. Statistical significance varied across these attitudinal outcomes. Our findings invite further research and controlled studies to better understand the apparent benefits of sharing, rotating, and splitting roles in introductory physics labs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Readiness in Latin American High Schools: Curriculum Compatibility and Enabling Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating global development of quantum technologies strengthens the case for introducing quantum computing concepts before university. Yet in Latin America, there is no consolidated, region wide integration of quantum computing into secondary education, and the feasibility conditions for doing so remain largely unexamined. This paper proposes a qualitative, comparative framework to assess academic readiness for quantum education across six countries - Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia - grounded in the relationship between curriculum compatibility and enabling conditions spanning institutional capacity, teacher preparation, infrastructure, and equity. Using official curricula, policy documents, national statistics, and educational reports, we apply structured qualitative coding and a 1-5 ordinal scoring system to generate a cross country diagnosis. The findings reveal substantial regional asymmetries: among the six countries studied, Chile emerges as the most institutionally prepared for progressive quantum education integration, while the remaining countries exhibit varying combinations of curricular gaps and fragmented but promising enabling conditions. Building on this diagnosis, we propose a country sensitive, regionally coordinated roadmap for staged implementation, beginning with teacher development and pilot centers, leveraging open source platforms and local language resources, and scaling toward gradual curricular integration. This work establishes a baseline for future quantitative and mixed method studies evaluating learning outcomes, motivation, and scalable models for quantum education in Latin America.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Kinematics Understanding Through a Real-Time Graph-Based Motion Video Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematics is a core topic in early physics courses, yet students often struggle to interpret motion and its graphical representations. To tackle these difficulties, we developed MissionMotion, a physical-computational videogame where students reproduce target motion graphs using real-time data from their own movements or from sensors connected through micro:bit or Arduino. The system displays both the target and the user-generated graph, providing immediate visual feedback and a score based on similarity. We piloted the environment with ninth-grade students in different school contexts and evaluated their experience using the MEEGA+ instrument. The results show strong engagement, positive perceptions of usability, and evidence that the game promotes reflection on motion graphs in ways that rarely emerge in traditional lessons. MissionMotion runs on any web-enabled device and all materials are openly available, offering teachers an accessible tool to integrate experimentation, computational thinking, and playful learning into physics classrooms.</description>

      <title>An Open Workflow Model for Improving Educational Video Design: Tools, Data, and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Educational videos are widely used across various instructional models in higher education to support flexible and self-paced learning. However, student engagement with these videos varies significantly depending on how they are designed. While several studies have identified potential influencing factors, there remains a lack of scalable tools and open datasets to support large-scale, data-driven improvements in video design. This study aims to advance data-driven approaches to educational video design. Its core contributions include: (1) a workflow model for analysing educational videos; (2) an open-source implementation for extracting video metadata and features; (3) an accessible, community-driven database of video attributes; (4) a case study applying the approach to two engineering courses; and (5) an initial machine learning-based analysis to explore the relative influence of various video characteristics on student engagement. This work lays the groundwork for a shared, evidence-based approach to educational video design.</description>
