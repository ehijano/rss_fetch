      <title>Metadata-guided Feature Disentanglement for Functional Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of high-throughput technologies, genomics datasets rapidly grow in size, including functional genomics data. This has allowed the training of large Deep Learning (DL) models to predict epigenetic readouts, such as protein binding or histone modifications, from genome sequences. However, large dataset sizes come at a price of data consistency, often aggregating results from a large number of studies, conducted under varying experimental conditions. While data from large-scale consortia are useful as they allow studying the effects of different biological conditions, they can also contain unwanted biases from confounding experimental factors. Here, we introduce Metadata-guided Feature Disentanglement (MFD) - an approach that allows disentangling biologically relevant features from potential technical biases. MFD incorporates target metadata into model training, by conditioning weights of the model output layer on different experimental factors. It then separates the factors into disjoint groups and enforces independence of the corresponding feature subspaces with an adversarially learned penalty. We show that the metadata-driven disentanglement approach allows for better model introspection, by connecting latent features to experimental factors, without compromising, or even improving performance in downstream tasks, such as enhancer prediction, or genetic variant discovery. The code for our implemementation is available at https://github.com/HealthML/MFD</description>

      <title>CAVACHON: a hierarchical variational autoencoder to integrate multi-modal single-cell data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paired single-cell sequencing technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of complementary modalities of molecular data at single-cell resolution. Along with the advances in these technologies, many methods based on variational autoencoders have been developed to integrate these data. However, these methods do not explicitly incorporate prior biological relationships between the data modalities, which could significantly enhance modeling and interpretation. We propose a novel probabilistic learning framework that explicitly incorporates conditional independence relationships between multi-modal data as a directed acyclic graph using a generalized hierarchical variational autoencoder. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework across various applications pertinent to single-cell multi-omics data integration. These include the isolation of common and distinct information from different modalities, modality-specific differential analysis, and integrated cell clustering. We anticipate that the proposed framework can facilitate the construction of highly flexible graphical models that can capture the complexities of biological hypotheses and unravel the connections between different biological data types, such as different modalities of paired single-cell multi-omics data. The implementation of the proposed framework can be found in the repository https://github.com/kuijjerlab/CAVACHON.</description>

      <title>A SARS-CoV-2 Interaction Dataset and VHH Sequence Corpus for Antibody Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to eliminate harmful foreign substances and have become pivotal therapeutic agents for treating human diseases. To accelerate the discovery of antibody therapeutics, there is growing interest in constructing language models using antibody sequences. However, the applicability of pre-trained language models for antibody discovery has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the scarcity of labeled datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2, a dataset featuring the antigen-variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) interactions obtained from two alpacas immunized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins. AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 includes binary labels indicating the binding or non-binding of diverse VHH sequences to 12 SARS-CoV-2 mutants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, we release VHHCorpus-2M, a pre-training dataset for antibody language models, containing over two million VHH sequences. We report benchmark results for predicting SARS-CoV-2-VHH binding using VHHBERT pre-trained on VHHCorpus-2M and existing general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models. These results confirm that AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating the representation capabilities of antibody language models for binding prediction, thereby facilitating the development of AI-driven antibody discovery. The datasets are available at https://datasets.cognanous.com.</description>

      <title>3D genome reconstruction from partially phased Hi-C data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome is of significant importance for many cellular processes. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing the 3D structure of chromosomes from Hi-C data of diploid organisms, which poses additional challenges compared to the better-studied haploid setting. With the help of techniques from algebraic geometry, we prove that a small amount of phased data is sufficient to ensure finite identifiability, both for noiseless and noisy data. In the light of these results, we propose a new 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite programming, paired with numerical algebraic geometry and local optimization. The performance of this method is tested on several simulated datasets under different noise levels and with different amounts of phased data. We also apply it to a real dataset from mouse X chromosomes, and we are then able to recover previously known structural features.</description>

      <title>Exploring gene content with pangene graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: The gene content regulates the biology of an organism. It varies between species and between individuals of the same species. Although tools have been developed to identify gene content changes in bacterial genomes, none is applicable to collections of large eukaryotic genomes such as the human pangenome.
  Results: We developed pangene, a computational tool to identify gene orientation, gene order and gene copy-number changes in a collection of genomes. Pangene aligns a set of input protein sequences to the genomes, resolves redundancies between protein sequences and constructs a gene graph with each genome represented as a walk in the graph. It additionally finds subgraphs, which we call bibubbles, that capture gene content changes. Applied to the human pangenome, pangene identifies known gene-level variations and reveals complex haplotypes that are not well studied before. Pangene also works with high-quality bacterial pangenome and reports similar numbers of core and accessory genes in comparison to existing tools.

      <title>LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, have become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce LangCell, the first Language-Cell pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.</description>

      <title>Statistical Linear Models in Virus Genomic Alignment-free Classification: Application to Hepatitis C Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viral sequence classification is an important task in pathogen detection, epidemiological surveys and evolutionary studies. Statistical learning methods are widely used to classify and identify viral sequences in samples from environments. These methods face several challenges associated with the nature and properties of viral genomes such as recombination, mutation rate and diversity. Also, new generations of sequencing technologies rise other difficulties by generating massive amounts of fragmented sequences. While linear classifiers are often used to classify viruses, there is a lack of exploration of the accuracy space of existing models in the context of alignment free approaches. In this study, we present an exhaustive assessment procedure exploring the power of linear classifiers in genotyping and subtyping partial and complete genomes. It is applied to the Hepatitis C viruses (HCV). Several variables are considered in this investigation such as classifier types (generative and discriminative) and their hyper-parameters (smoothing value and regularization penalty function), the classification task (genotyping and subtyping), the length of the tested sequences (partial and complete) and the length of k-mer words. Overall, several classifiers perform well given a set of precise combination of the experimental variables mentioned above. Finally, we provide the procedure and benchmark data to allow for more robust assessment of classification from virus genomes.</description>
