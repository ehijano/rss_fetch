      <title>Weighted shape-constrained estimation for the autocovariance sequence from a reversible Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel weighted $\ell_2$ projection method for estimating autocovariance sequences and spectral density functions from reversible Markov chains. Berg and Song (2023) introduced a least-squares shape-constrained estimation approach for the autocovariance function by projecting an initial estimate onto a shape-constrained space using an $\ell_2$ projection. While the least-squares objective is commonly used in shape-constrained regression, it can be suboptimal due to correlation and unequal variances in the input function. To address this, we propose a weighted least-squares method that defines a weighted norm on transformed data. Specifically, we transform an input autocovariance sequence into the Fourier domain and apply weights based on the asymptotic variance of the sample periodogram, leveraging the asymptotic independence of periodogram ordinates. Our proposal can equivalently be viewed as estimating a spectral density function by applying shape constraints to its Fourier series. We demonstrate that our weighted approach yields strongly consistent estimates for both the spectral density and the autocovariance sequence. Empirical studies show its effectiveness in uncertainty quantification for Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation, outperforming the unweighted moment LS estimator and other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Advances in projection predictive inference</title>

Abstract: The concepts of Bayesian prediction, model comparison, and model selection have developed significantly over the last decade. As a result, the Bayesian community has witnessed a rapid growth in theoretical and applied contributions to building and selecting predictive models. Projection predictive inference in particular has shown promise to this end, finding application across a broad range of fields. It is less prone to over-fitting than na\"ive selection based purely on cross-validation or information criteria performance metrics, and has been known to out-perform other methods in terms of predictive performance. We survey the core concept and contemporary contributions to projection predictive inference, and present a safe, efficient, and modular workflow for prediction-oriented model selection therein. We also provide an interpretation of the projected posteriors achieved by projection predictive inference in terms of their limitations in causal settings.</description>

      <title>PySDTest: a Python/Stata Package for Stochastic Dominance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce PySDTest, a Python/Stata package for statistical tests of stochastic dominance. PySDTest implements various testing procedures such as Barrett and Donald (2003), Linton et al. (2005), Linton et al. (2010), and Donald and Hsu (2016), along with their extensions. Users can flexibly combine several resampling methods and test statistics, including the numerical delta method (D\"umbgen, 1993; Hong and Li, 2018; Fang and Santos, 2019). The package allows for testing advanced hypotheses on stochastic dominance relations, such as stochastic maximality among multiple prospects. We first provide an overview of the concepts of stochastic dominance and testing methods. Then, we offer practical guidance for using the package and the Stata command pysdtest. We apply PySDTest to investigate the portfolio choice problem between the daily returns of Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index as an empirical illustration. Our findings indicate that the S&amp;P 500 index returns second-order stochastically dominate the Bitcoin returns.</description>
