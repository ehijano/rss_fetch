      <title>Stochastic Processes and Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we explore the mathematical preliminaries and foundational concepts
  that connect stochastic processes with partial differential equations. We begin by investigating
  Brownian motion, which serves as a model for random fluctuations and is deeply connected to
  the heat equation. This connection forms the basis for understanding diffusion phenomena, where
  the probability distribution of Brownian motion evolves according to the heat equation over time.
  To extend this classical result to more general stochastic systems, we introduce the It\^o calculus,
  a powerful framework that allows us to analyze processes driven by both deterministic drift and
  stochastic fluctuations. This mathematical tool is essential for understanding the dynamics of more
  complex diffusion processes, where randomness is no longer purely Brownian, but also depends
  on the underlying system's state. Building on these concepts, we turn to the study of diffusion
  processes, which generalize Brownian motion by incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation. This
  equation describes how the probability density of a diffusion process evolves over time and serves
  as an extension of the heat equation to more complex stochastic systems. By using It\^o calculus,
  we can rigorously study how these processes behave and connect the microscopic randomness of
  individual particles to their macroscopic description via partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time optimal control of stochastic third-grade fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address the velocity tracking control problem for a class of stochastic non-Newtonian fluids. More precisely, we consider the stochastic third-grade fluid equation perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive white noise and defined on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^2$. The control acts as a distributed random external force. Taking an \emph{infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process}, the stochastic system is converted into an equivalent pathwise deterministic one, which allows to show the well-posedness of the original stochastic system globally in time. The state being a stochastic process with sample paths in $\mathrm{L}^\infty(0,T;\mathbb{H}^3(\mathbb{T}^2))$ and finite moments can be controlled in an optimal way. Namely, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding linearized state and adjoint equations. Furthermore, we derive an appropriate stability result for the state equation and verify that the G\^ateaux derivative of the control-to-state mapping coincides with the solution of the linearized state equation. Finally, we establish the first-order optimality conditions and prove the existence of an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Local Statistics of Singular Values for Products of Truncated Unitary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates local spectral statistics of singular values for many products of independent large rectangular matrices, sampled from the ensemble of truncated unitary matrices with the invariant Haar measure. Our main contribution establishes a universal three-phase transition in these statistics, demonstrating an interpolation beween GUE statistics and classical Gaussian behavior. While such transition was previously known for products of complex Gaussian matrices\cite{ABK19}\cite{LWW23}, the current work provides the complete characterization in the truncated unitary matrix setting.</description>

      <title>Partition function of 2D Coulomb gases with radially symmetric potentials and a hard wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large $N$ asymptotic expansion of the partition function for the normal matrix model is predicted to have special features inherited from its interpretation as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas. However for the latter, it is most natural to include a hard wall at the boundary of the droplet. We probe how this affects the asymptotic expansion in the solvable case that the potential is radially symmetric and the droplet is a disk or an annulus. We allow too for the hard wall to be strictly inside the boundary of the droplet. It is observed the term of order $\log N$, has then a different rational number prefactor to that when the hard wall is at the droplet boundary. Also found are certain universal (potential independent) numerical constants given by definite integrals, both at order $\sqrt{N}$, and in the constant term.</description>

      <title>Quenched invariance principle with a rate for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quenched invariance principle for random Young towers driven by an ergodic system. In particular, we obtain the Wassertein convergence rate in the quenched invariance principle. As a key ingredient, we derive a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for the random tower map, which provides a good control over sums of squares of the approximating martingale. We apply our results to a class of random dynamical systems that admit a random Young tower, such as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) translations of Viana maps, intermittent maps of the interval and small random perturbations of Anosov maps with an ergodic driving system.</description>

      <title>Rademacher learning rates for iterated random functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing literature on supervised machine learning assumes that the training dataset is drawn from an i.i.d. sample. However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any countable group $ G $ equipped with a probability measure $ \mu $, there exists a randomized stopping time $ \tau $ such that $ (G, \mu _{\tau} )$ admits a strictly larger space of bounded harmonic functions than $ (G,\mu) $, unless this space is trivial for all measures on $ G $. In particular, we exhibit an irreducible probability measure on the free group $F_2$ such that the Poisson boundary is strictly larger than the geometric boundary equipped with the hitting measure, resolving a longstanding open problem. As another consequence, there is never a nontrivial universal topological realization of the Poisson boundary for any countable group.</description>

Abstract: An anecdotally common complaint regarding induction into the Gold Humanism Honor Society is the bias toward close friends during the initial nomination process. In this work, we numerically simulate the nomination process under different assumptions, demonstrate that collusion can be detected, and propose a simple strategy to correct for bias in the nomination process.</description>

      <title>An Exact and Efficient Sampler for Dynamic Discrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a dynamic discrete distribution involves sampling from a dynamic set of weighted elements, where elements can be added or removed at any stage of the sampling process. Although efficient for static sets, the Alias method becomes impractical in dynamic settings due to the need to reconstruct the sampler after each update, which incurs a computational cost proportional to the size of the distribution, making it unsuitable for applications requiring frequent insertions, deletions, or weight adjustments. To address this limitation, different approaches have been studied, such as the Forest of Trees method and the BUcket Sampling (BUS) method. However, all previous methods suffered from numerical issues which can bias the sampling process. In this paper, we describe EBUS (Exact BUcket Sampling), the first exact algorithm with $O(1)$ sampling and update cost. The sampler can be updated by base-$b$ numbers with bounded precision and exponent, and sample the distribution of its elements exactly and efficiently. We provide also a state of the art implementation of the method using IEEE 64-bit floating point numbers which we empirically show to be more efficient than several implementations of previous inexact methods.</description>

      <title>Level-3 large deviations for the white-forced 2D Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large deviations principle (LDP) of Donsker-Varadhan type for the white-forced Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain. Under the assumption that the noise is non-degenerate, we establish level-2 and level-3 LDPs with rate functions given by the Donsker-Varadhan formulas. The proof relies on an improved version of Kifer's criterion, a lift argument inspired from [DV83], an improved abstract result on the large-time asymptotics of generalized Markov semigroups, and a delicate approximation scheme utilizing the resolvent operators of the Markov semigroup.</description>

Abstract: We provide a basis transformation that inverts the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. It is widely believed that the Bethe Ansatz is complete, based on numerical evidence and combinatorial arguments. We present a constructive and comprehensive approach to show that the Bethe Ansatz is complete. The transformation formula is verified numerically with excellent accuracy for non-zero anisotropy parameters and rings of odd length. Additionally, assuming the Bethe Ansatz is complete, we derive a novel exact formula for the one-point function systems through special identities for the Izergin-Korepin determinant.</description>

Abstract: We construct an aggregator for a family of Snell envelopes in a nondominated framework. We apply this construction to establish a robust hedging duality, along with the existence of a minimal hedging strategy, in a general semi-martingale setting for American-style options. Our results encompass continuous processes, or processes with jumps and non-vanishing diffusion. A key application is to financial market models, where uncertainty is quantified through the semi-martingale characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze posterior consistency of a Bayesian data assimilation problem under discretization. We prove convergence rates for the discrete posterior to ground truth solution under both conforming discretization and finite element discretization (usually non-conforming). The analysis is based on the coupling of asymptotics between the number of samples and the dimension of discrete spaces. In the finite element discretization, tailor-made discrete priors, instead of the discretization of continuous priors, are used to generate an optimal convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.</description>

      <title>Generating uniform linear extensions using few random bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A \emph{linear extension} of a partial order \(\preceq\) over items \(A = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}\) is a permutation \(\sigma\) such that for all \(i &lt; j\) in \(A\), it holds that \(\neg(\sigma(j) \preceq \sigma(i))\). Consider the problem of generating uniformly from the set of linear extensions of a partial order. The best method currently known uses \(O(n^3 \ln(n))\) operations and \(O(n^3 \ln(n)^2)\) iid fair random bits to generate such a permutation. This paper presents a method that generates a uniform linear extension using only \(2.75 n^3 \ln(n)\) operations and \( 1.83 n^3 \ln(n) \) iid fair bits on average.</description>

      <title>Elliptic stochastic quantization of Sinh-Gordon QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (elliptic) stochastic quantization equation for the (massive) $\cosh(\beta \varphi)_2$ model, for the charged parameter in the $L^2$ regime (i.e. $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$), is studied. We prove the existence, uniqueness and the properties of the invariant measure of the solution to this equation. The proof is obtained through a priori estimates and a lattice approximation of the equation. For implementing this strategy we generalize some properties of Besov spaces in the continuum to analogous results for Besov spaces on the lattice. As a final result we show how to use the stochastic quantization equation to verify the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for the $\cosh (\beta \varphi)_2$ quantum field theory, including the exponential decay of correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Universality and Phase Transitions in Low Moments of Secular Coefficients of Critical Holomorphic Multiplicative Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low moments $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}], 0&lt;q\leq 1$ of {secular coefficients} $A_N$ of the {critical non-Gaussian holomorphic multiplicative chaos}, i.e. coefficients of $z^N$ in the power series expansion of $\exp(\sum_{k=1}^\infty X_kz^k/\sqrt{k})$, where $\{X_k\}_{k\geq 1}$ are i.i.d. rotationally invariant unit variance complex random variables. Inspired by Harper's remarkable result on random multiplicative functions, Soundararajan and Zaman recently showed that if each $X_k$ is standard complex Gaussian, $A_N$ features better-than-square-root cancellation: $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^2]=1$ and $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}]\asymp (\log N)^{-q/2}$ for fixed $q\in(0,1)$ as $N\to\infty$. We show that this asymptotics holds universally if $\mathbb{E}[e^{\gamma|X_k|}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\gamma&gt;2q$. As a consequence, we establish the universality for the tightness of the normalized secular coefficients $A_N(\log(1+N))^{1/4}$, generalizing a result of Najnudel, Paquette, and Simm. Another corollary is the almost sure regularity of some critical non-Gaussian holomorphic chaos in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotics of $\mathbb{E}[|A_N|^{2q}]$ for $|X_k|$ following a stretched exponential distribution with an arbitrary scale parameter, which exhibits a completely different behavior and underlying mechanism from the Gaussian universality regime. As a result, we unveil a double-layer phase transition around the critical case of exponential tails. Our proofs combine Harper's robust approach with a careful analysis of the (possibly random) leading terms in the monomial decomposition of $A_N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure of a general interacting particle system for a certain class of ``weakly interacting" kernels. In particular, we show that the local point process converges to a Poisson point process as long as the inverse temperature $\beta$ satisfies $N^{-1} \ll \beta \ll N^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, where $N$ is the number of particles. This expands the temperature regime for which convergence to a Poisson point process has been proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide mathematical foundations for the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite Borel measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, a quotient of the space of circle reparametrisations. The measure is defined by a natural change of variables formula, which we show uniquely characterises it. We further compute its partition function (total mass) from this change of variable formula. The existence of the measure then follows from an explicit construction involving a nonlinear transformation of a Brownian Bridge, proposed by Belokurov--Shavgulidze. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from this measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Explicit convergence rates of underdamped Langevin dynamics under weighted and weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the underdamped Langevin dynamics, in the case of so-called \emph{weak confinement}. Indeed, any $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ distribution (in position and velocity) relaxes to equilibrium over time, and we quantify the convergence rate. In our situation, the spatial equilibrium distribution does not satisfy a Poincar\'e inequality. Instead, we assume a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, which allows for fat-tail or sub-exponential potential energies. We provide constructive and fully explicit estimates in $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm for $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ initial data. A key-ingredient is a new space-time weighted Poincar\'e--Lions inequality, entailing, in turn, a weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a weighted sum of a series of independent Poisson random variables and show that it results in a new compound Poisson distribution which includes the Poisson distribution and Poisson distribution of order k. An explicit representation for its distribution is obtained in terms of Bell polynomials. We then extend it to a compound Poisson process and time fractional compound Poisson process (TFCPP). It is shown that the one-dimensional distributions of the TFCPP exhibit over-dispersion property, are not infinitely divisible and possess the long-range dependence property. Also, their moments and factorial moments are derived. Finally, the fractional differential equation associated with the TFCPP is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Sparse Pseudospectral Shattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices can be unstable under perturbations of their entries. This renders an obstacle to the analysis of numerical algorithms for non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. A recent technique to handle this issue is pseudospectral shattering [BGVKS23], showing that adding a random perturbation to any matrix has a regularizing effect on the stability of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Prior work has analyzed the regularizing effect of dense Gaussian perturbations, where independent noise is added to every entry of a given matrix [BVKS20, BGVKS23, BKMS21, JSS21].
  We show that the same effect can be achieved by adding a sparse random perturbation. In particular, we show that given any $n\times n$ matrix $M$ of polynomially bounded norm: (a) perturbing $O(n\log^2(n))$ random entries of $M$ by adding i.i.d. complex Gaussians yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ and $\log (1/\eta(A))=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ with high probability; (b) perturbing $O(n^{1+\alpha})$ random entries of $M$ for any constant $\alpha&gt;0$ yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ and $\log(1/\eta(A))=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ with high probability. Here, $\kappa_V(A)$ denotes the condition number of the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix $A$ and $\eta(A)$ denotes its minimum eigenvalue gap.
  A key mechanism of the proof is to reduce the study of $\kappa_V(A)$ to control of the pseudospectral area and minimum eigenvalue gap of $A$, which are further reduced to estimates on the least two singular values of shifts of $A$. We obtain the required least singular value estimates via a streamlining of an argument of Tao and Vu [TV07] specialized to the case of sparse complex Gaussian perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal limit theorem is a central result in rough path theory, which has been proved for: (i) rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$; (ii) geometric rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$; (iii) branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths are natural generalizations of both rough paths and branched rough paths, in the sense that post-Lie algebras are generalizations of both Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras. Here the primitive elements of the graded dual Hopf algebra of the Hopf algebra corresponding to the planarly branched rough paths (resp. rough paths, resp. branched rough paths) form a post-Lie (resp. Lie, resp. pre-Lie algebra). In this paper, we prove the universal limit theorem for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$, via the method of Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

Abstract: We use Wasserstein distances to characterize and study probabilistic frames. Adapting results from Olkin and Pukelsheim, from Gelbrich and from Cuesta-Albertos, Matran-Bea and Tuero-Diaz to frame operators, we show that the sets of probabilistic frames with given frame operator are homeomorphic by an optimal linear push-forward. Using the Wasserstein distances, we generalize several recent results in probabilistic frame theory and show path connectedness of the set of probabilistic frames with a fixed frame operator. We also describe transport duals that do not arise as push-forwards and characterize those that are push-forwards.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for scaled families of Schr\"odinger bridges with reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a large deviation principle for certain sequences of static Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, typically motivated by a scale-parameter decreasing towards zero, extending existing large deviation results to cover a wider range of reference processes. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for studying convergence of such Schr\"{o}dinger bridges to their limiting optimal transport plans. Within generative modeling, Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, or entropic optimal transport problems, constitute a prominent class of methods, in part because of their computational feasibility in high-dimensional settings. Recently, Bernton et al. established a large deviation principle, in the small-noise limit, for fixed-cost entropic optimal transport problems. In this paper, we address an open problem posed by Bernton et al. and extend their results to hold for Schr\"{o}dinger bridges associated with certain sequences of more general reference measures with enough regularity in a similar small-noise limit. These can be viewed as sequences of entropic optimal transport plans with non-fixed cost functions. Using a detailed analysis of the associated Skorokhod maps and transition densities, we show that the new large deviation results cover Schr\"{o}dinger bridges where the reference process is a reflected diffusion on bounded convex domains, corresponding to recently introduced model choices in the generative modeling literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consensus dynamics of the voter model on large random graphs with heterogeneous and directed features, focusing in particular on networks with power-law degree distributions. By extending recent results on sparse directed graphs, we derive exact first-order asymptotics for the expected consensus time in directed configuration models with i.i.d. Pareto-distributed in- and out-degrees. For any tail exponent {\alpha}&gt;0, we derive the mean consensus time scaling depending on the network size and a pre-factor that encodes detailed structural properties of the degree sequences. We give an explicit description of the pre factor in the directed setting. This extends and sharpens previous mean-field predictions from statistical physics, providing the first explicit consensus-time formula in the directed heavy-tailed setting. Through extensive simulations, we confirm the validity of our predictions across a wide range of heterogeneity regimes, including networks with infinite variance and infinite mean degree distribution. We further explore the interplay between network topology and voter dynamics, highlighting how degree fluctuations and maximal degrees shape the consensus landscape. Complementing the asymptotic analysis, we provide numerical evidence for the emergence of Wright-Fisher diffusive behavior in both directed and undirected ensembles under suitable mixing conditions, and demonstrate the breakdown of this approximation in the in the infinite mean regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study from a theoretical viewpoint the fundamental problem of efficiently computing the stationary distribution of general classes of structured Markov processes. In strong contrast with previous work, we consider this fundamental problem within the context of quantum computational environments from a mathematical perspective and devise the first quantum algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of general structured Markov processes. We derive a mathematical analysis of the computational properties of our quantum algorithms together with related theoretical results, establishing that our quantum algorithms provide the potential for significant computational improvements over that of the best-known and most-efficient classical algorithms in various settings of both theoretical and practical importance. Although motivated by general structured Markov processes, our quantum algorithms can be exploited to address a much larger class of numerical computation problems, as well as to potentially play the role of a subroutine as part of solving larger computational problems involving the stationary distribution on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is said to have won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5) and (49, 6, 6, 5) lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades. There is no absolute evidence beyond doubt, but the size of actual covering designs and the associated efforts allow the following hypothesis: Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5) covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery. Calculations indicate that he took considerable risks that his method might fail, because he limited himself to a subset of 15 numbers out of 49 numbers. The risks explain why he later changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot.</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new asymptotic expansion approach for nonlinear filtering based on a small parameter in the system noise. This method expresses the filtering distribution as a power series in the noise level, where the coefficients can be computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. As a result, it addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. In the course of our derivation, we also show that classical linear filtering and smoothing equations, namely Kalman-Bucy filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, can be obtained in a unified and transparent manner from an explicit formula for the conditional distribution of the hidden path.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Extending Continuous-Mixture Identifiability Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture distributions provide a versatile and widely used framework for modeling random phenomena, and are particularly well-suited to the analysis of geoscientific processes and their attendant risks to society. For continuous mixtures of random variables, we specify a simple criterion - generating-function accessibility - to extend previously known kernel-based identifiability (or unidentifiability) results to new kernel distributions. This criterion, based on functional relationships between the relevant kernels' moment-generating functions or Laplace transforms, may be applied to continuous mixtures of both discrete and continuous random variables. To illustrate the proposed approach, we present results for several specific kernels, in each case briefly noting its relevance to research in the geosciences and/or related risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on a generalized Hamming cube \MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the critical probability $p_c(Q_n,r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r$ on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $V(Q_n)=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. More precisely, by utilizing the techniques developed by Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009), we determine the first-order term of $p_c(Q_n,n^a)$ where $\frac{2}{3}&lt;a&lt; 1$. Additionally, we obtain the critical probability $p_c(Q_{k,n},r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r=\frac{N}{2}$ on the generalized $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_{k,n}$ with vertex set $V(Q_{k,n})=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$ and $N=\sum_{i=1}^k\binom{n}{i}$. More precisely, we obtain the first-order term of $p_c(Q_{k,n},\frac{N}{2})$ and some bounds on the second-order term by extending the main theorem from Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009).</description>

      <title>Assessing Risk Heterogeneity through Heavy-Tailed Frequency and Severity Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In operational risk management and actuarial finance, the analysis of risk often begins by dividing a random damage-generation process into its separate frequency and severity components. In the present article, we construct canonical families of mixture distributions for each of these components, based on a Negative Binomial kernel for frequency and a Gamma kernel for severity. The mixtures are employed to assess the heterogeneity of risk factors underlying an empirical distribution through the shape of the implied mixing distribution. From the duality of the Negative Binomial and Gamma distributions, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for heavy-tailed (i.e., inverse power-law) canonical mixtures. We then formulate flexible 4-parameter families of mixing distributions for Geometric and Exponential kernels to generate heavy-tailed 4-parameter mixture models, and extend these mixtures to arbitrary Negative Binomial and Gamma kernels, respectively, yielding 5-parameter mixtures for detecting and measuring risk heterogeneity. To check the robustness of such heterogeneity inferences, we show how a fitted 5-parameter model may be re-expressed in terms of alternative Negative Binomial or Gamma kernels whose associated mixing distributions form a "calibrated" family.</description>
