      <title>The size of the sync basin resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to model the winding number as a sum of weakly dependent variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

      <title>Quasi-equivalence of Gaussian states and energy estimates for functions of modular Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To compare two Gaussian states of the Weyl-CCR algebra of a free scalar QFT we study three closely related perspectives: (i) quasi-equivalence of the GNS-representations, (ii) differences of the total energy (on some Cauchy surface), and (iii) differences between functions of the modular Hamiltonians. (For perspective (ii) we will only consider real linear free scalar quantum fields on ultrastatic spacetimes.) These three perspectives are known to be related qualitatively, due to work of Araki and Yamagami, Verch and Longo. Our aim is to investigate quantitative relations, including in particular estimates of differences between functions of modular Hamiltonians in terms of energy differences.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a deformed topological gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05284v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe gauge theories which allow to retrieve a large class of gravitational theories, including, MacDowell-Mansouri gravity and its topological extension to Loop Quantum Gravity via the Pontrjagin characteristic class involving the Nieh-Yan term. Considering symmetric spaces parametrized by mutations allows to naturally obtain a bare cosmological constant which in particular cases gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant while having an AdS spacetime.
  Two examples are studied, Lorentzian geometry (including dS and AdS spacetimes) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl geometry. In the latter case we prove the equations of motion exhibit a secondary source for curvature in addition to the usual energy-momentum tensor. This additional source is expressed in terms of the spin density of matter, torsion and their variations.
  Finally, we show that the gauge + matter actions constructed from invariant polynomials are asymptotically topological if one assumes a vanishing bare cosmological constant together with gauge and matter fields having compact support.</description>

      <title>Tensor Renormalization Group Meets Computer Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor renormalization group, originally devised as a numerical technique, is emerging as a rigorous analytical framework for studying lattice models in statistical physics. Here we introduce a new renormalization map - the 2x1 map - which coarse-grains the lattice anisotropically by a factor of two in one direction followed by a 90-degree rotation. We develop a novel graphical language that translates the action of the 2x1 map into a system of inequalities on tensor components, with rigorous estimates in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We define a finite-dimensional "bounding box" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum can take non-integer values in a closed universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of orbital angular momentum in quantum mechanics consists of two parts when the underlying space has periodic boundaries. While the first part consists of the usual textbook integer quantized values, the second is a continuous band arising from regions at the `edge' of space with respect to the center of rotation. The spectrum thus contains not only half-integer values, previously thought impossible for orbital angular momentum, but even irrational ones. Remarkably, this effect is independent of the size of space. While these spectral components remain undetectable in laboratory experiments, they could still produce observable effects on cosmological scales, for instance in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of a class of multidimensional quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators that exhibit a Cantor spectrum, which provides a resolution to a question posed by Damanik, Fillman, and Gorodetski \cite{DFG}. Additionally, we prove that for a dense set of irrational frequencies with positive Hausdorff dimension, the Hausdorff (and upper box) dimension of the spectrum of the critical almost Mathieu operator is positive, yet can be made arbitrarily small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum field theory for a scalar model of the electromagnetic field interacting with a system of two-level atoms. In this setting, we show that it is possible to uniquely determine the density of atoms from measurements of the source to solution map for a system of nonlocal partial differential equations, which describe the scattering of a two-photon state from the atoms. The required measurements involve correlating the outputs of a point detector with an integrating detector, thereby providing information about the entanglement of the photons.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>A stringy dispersion relation for field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained derivation of the local, parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation for 2-2 scattering, which is motivated by string theory. In various limits of the parameter, this stringy dispersion relation goes over to various known dispersion relations like fixed-$t$, fixed-$s$, local crossing symmetric etc. We present formulas applicable for any number of subtractions. Several examples are discussed for illustration. In particular, the Veneziano and the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes are shown to admit series representations that manifest poles in all channels and converge everywhere. We then discuss applications to weakly-coupled gravitational EFTs, and explain how the parameter can be used to derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients by working in the forward limit ($t=0$), even in the presence of the graviton pole. Finally, our approach also enables us to find series representations for multi-variable, totally symmetric generalisations of the Venziano and Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes that manifest poles in all the variables. In the future, this may be useful for finding $n$-particle dispersion relations, and we take the first steps in this direction.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model for polyatomic gas with quasi-resonant collisions leading to bi-temperature relaxation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the Boltzmann framework for polyatomic gases by introducing quasi-resonant kernels, which relax resonant interactions, for which kinetic and internal energies are separately conserved and lead to equilibrium states with two temperatures. We establish an H-theorem and analyze the quasi-resonant model's asymptotic behaviour, demonstrating a two-phase relaxation process: an initial convergence towards a two-temperature Maxwellian state followed by gradual relaxation of the two temperatures towards each other. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical predictions. The notion of quasi-resonance provides the first rigorous framework of a Boltzmann dynamics for which the distribution is at all times close to a multi-temperature Maxwellian, relaxing towards a one-temperature Maxwellian.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures, as a direct consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measure for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies.</description>

      <title>From Weingarten calculus for real Grassmannians to deformations of monotone Hurwitz numbers and Jucys-Murphy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work is inspired by three interrelated themes: Weingarten calculus for integration over unitary groups, monotone Hurwitz numbers which enumerate certain factorisations of permutations into transpositions, and Jucys-Murphy elements in the symmetric group algebra. The authors and Moskovsky recently extended this picture to integration on complex Grassmannians, leading to a deformation of the monotone Hurwitz numbers to polynomials that are conjectured to satisfy remarkable interlacing phenomena.
  In this paper, we consider integration on the real Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_\mathbb{R}(M,N)$, interpreted as the space of $N \times N$ idempotent real symmetric matrices of rank $M$. We show that in the regime of large $N$ and fixed $\frac{M}{N}$, such integrals have expansions whose coefficients are variants of monotone Hurwitz numbers that are polynomials in the parameter $t = 1 - \frac{N}{M}$.
  We define a "$b$-Weingarten calculus", without reference to underlying matrix integrals, that recovers the unitary case at $b = 0$ and the orthogonal case at $b = 1$. The $b$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, previously introduced by Bonzom, Chapuy and Dolega, arise naturally in this context as monotone factorisations of pair partitions. The $b$- and $t$-deformations can be combined to form a common generalisation, leading to the notion of $bt$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, for which we state several results and conjectures.
  Finally, we introduce certain linear operators inspired by the aforementioned $b$-Weingarten calculus that can be considered as $b$-deformations of the Jucys-Murphy elements in the symmetric group algebra. We make several conjectures regarding these operators that generalise known properties of the Jucys-Murphy elements and make a connection to the family of Jack symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Transportation cost and contraction coefficient for channels on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a noncommutative optimal transport framework for quantum channels acting on von Neumann algebras. Our central object is the Lipschitz cost measure, a transportation-inspired quantity that evaluates the minimal cost required to move between quantum states via a given channel. Accompanying this is the Lipschitz contraction coefficient, which captures how much the channel contracts the Wasserstein-type distance between states. We establish foundational properties of these quantities, including continuity, dual formulations, and behavior under composition and tensorization. Applications include recovery of several mathematical quantities including expected group word length and Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance, via transportation cost. Moreover, we show that if the Lipschitz contraction coefficient is strictly less than one, one can get entropy contraction and mixing time estimates for certain classes of non-symmetric channels.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic approximation for equations of discrete turbulence in the subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a damped/driven cubic NLS equation on a torus under the limit when first the amplitude of solutions goes to zero and then the period of the torus goes to infinity. We suggest another proof of the kinetic approximation for the energy spectrum under a subcritical scaling, extending to the exact solutions result obtained in [Dymov, Kuksin, Maiocchi, Vladuts '2023] for quasisolutions which were defined as the second order truncations of decompositions for the solutions in amplitude. The proof does not involve Feynman diagrams, instead relying on a robust inductive analysis of cumulants.</description>

      <title>Curvature bound of Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00262v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a strongly local symmetric Dirichlet form on the configuration space $\Upsilon$ whose symmetrising (thus also invariant) measure is $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$, which is the law of the sine $\beta$ ensemble for every $\beta&gt;0$. For every $\beta&gt;0$, this Dirichlet form satisfies the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ with $K=0$. This implies various functional inequalities, including the local Poincar\'e inequality, the local log-Sobolev inequality and the local hyper-contractivity. We then introduce an $L^2$-transportation-type extended distance $\bar{\sf d}_{\Upsilon}$ on $\Upsilon$, and prove the dimension-free Harnack inequality and several Lipschitz regularisation estimates of the $L^2$-semigroup associated with the Dirichlet form in terms of $\bar{\sf d}_{\Upsilon}$. As a result of $\mathsf{BE}(0,\infty)$, we obtain that the dual semigroup on the space of probability measures over $\Upsilon$, endowed with a Benamou--Brenier-like extended distance $\mathsf{W}_{\mathcal E}$, satisfies the evolutional variation inequality with respect to the Bolzmann--Shannon entropy $\mathsf{Ent}_{\mathsf{sine}_\beta}$ associated with $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$. Furthermore, the dual semigroup is characterised as the unique $\mathsf{W}_{\mathcal E}$-gradient flow in the space of probability measures with respect to $\mathsf{Ent}_{\mathsf{sine}_\beta}$. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ beyond $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$ and apply it to the infinite particle diffusion whose symmetrising measure is the law of the $1$-dimensional $(\beta,s)$-circular Riesz gas with $\beta&gt;0$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras for the shuffle algebra and fractions from multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of multiple zeta values (MZVs) is encoded as a stuffle (quasi-shuffle) algebra and a shuffle algebra. The MZV stuffle algebra has a natural Hopf algebra structure. This paper equips a Hopf algebra structure to the MZV shuffle algebra. The needed coproduct is defined by a recursion through a family of weight-increasing linear operators. To verify the Hopf algebra axioms, we make use of a family of fractions, called Chen fractions, that have been used to study MZVs and also serve as the function model for the MZV shuffle algebra. Applying natural derivations on functions and working in the context of locality, a locality Hopf algebra structure is established on the linear span of Chen fractions. This locality Hopf algebra is then shown to descend to a Hopf algebra on the MZV shuffle algebra, whose coproduct satisfies the same recursion as the first-defined coproduct. Thus the two coproducts coincide, establishing the needed Hopf algebra axioms on the MZV shuffle algebra.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with some of the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Dynamics of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, during adiabatic evolution, any changes of entanglement can be traced to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps of eigenvectors weave the entanglement in multipartite systems. The efficiency of this weaving of entanglement depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and it is, therefore, constraining the speed of adiabatic evolution. Applied to adiabatic quantum computation, these results directly relate the adiabatic quantum computation speed to its utilization of the resource of entanglement. Further, the amount of entanglement involved in an adiabatic quantum computation can be related to the ruggedness of its energy landscape. We therefore obtain new tools for exploring the origins of quantum advantage in adiabatic quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. The entropyp roduction maximizing solutions are selected.
  Part I of this paper defines the entropy principle and using it, finds improved regularity for the Navier-Stokes solutions.
  Part II concerns initial data and its achievability as a limit of the small time data.
  Part III establishes analyticity properties of the Part II solution; Part IV demonstrates blowup in finite time.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme further predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions of pseudospherical surfaces described by a class of third order differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a specific type of pseudospherical surfaces defined by a class of third order differential equations, of the form $u_t - u_{xxt} = \lambda u^2 u_{xxx} + G(u, u_x, u_{xx})$, and poses a question about the dependence of the triples $\{a,b,c\}$ of the second fundamental form in the context of local isometric immersion in $\mathbb{E}^3$. It is demonstrated that the triples $\{a,b,c\}$ of the second fundamental form are not influenced by a jet of finite order of $u$. Instead, they are shown to rely on a jet of order zero, making them universal and not reliant on the specific solution chosen for $u$.</description>

      <title>On the CFT dual of superstring on AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be expressed as integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be expressed as integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>A microscopic Normal Matrix Model for $(A)dS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>
