      <title>Recurrence and Stickiness in the Noisy Harper Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When three types of noise are introduced to the area-preserving Harper map, the Poincar\'e recurrence statistic (PRS) exhibits an extended tail, corresponding to an increased probability of longer recurrence times. For a deterministic case with a mixture of regular and chaotic orbits, regular islands are responsible for a power-law decay in the recurrence distribution. Noise perturbations allow trajectories to access the interior of the islands, and this can enhance their trapping effect, causing many orbits to take longer to return to a neighborhood of their initial conditions and resulting in a slower power-law decay on an intermediate time scale. On a longer time scale, however, the noisy PRS exhibits exponential decay, eventually falling below the deterministic PRS. We compare distributions of trapping and visit times to islands with recurrence times to show the importance of noise in creating tails in the PRS. A simple model of the dynamics -- a Markov chain with three states -- demonstrates how the slower decay can be caused by noise allowing entry to a previously inaccessible island.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spacings in the superposed spectra of random matrices with comparison to spacing ratios and application to complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between random matrices and the spectral fluctuations of complex quantum systems in a suitable limit can be explained by using the setup of random matrix theory. Higher-order spacing statistics in the $m$ superposed spectra of circular random matrices are studied numerically. We tabulated the modified Dyson index $\beta'$ for a given $m$, $k$, and $\beta$, for which the nearest neighbor spacing distribution is the same as that of the $k$-th order spacing distribution corresponding to the $\beta$ and $m$. Here, we conjecture that for given $m(k)$ and $\beta$, the obtained sequence of $\beta'$ as a function of $k(m)$ is unique. This result can be used as a tool for the characterization of the system and to determine the symmetry structure of the system without desymmetrization of the spectra. We verify the results of the $m=2$ case of COE with the quantum kicked top model corresponding to various Hilbert space dimensions. From the comparative study of the higher-order spacings and ratios in both $m=1$ and $m=2$ cases of COE and GOE by varying dimension, keeping the number of realizations constant and vice-versa, we find that both COE and GOE have the same asymptotic behavior in terms of a given higher-order statistics. But, we found from our numerical study that within a given ensemble of COE or GOE, the results of spacings and ratios agree with each other only up to some lower $k$, and beyond that, they start deviating from each other. It is observed that for the $k=1$ case, the convergence towards the Poisson distribution is faster in the case of ratios than the corresponding spacings as we increase $m$ for a given $\beta$. Further, the spectral fluctuations of the intermediate map of various dimensions are studied. There, we find that the effect of random numbers used to generate the matrix corresponding to the map is reflected in the higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Deviations from spectral Dirac comb due to semiperiodic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15904v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the frequency power spectral density, periodic oscillations appear as a Dirac comb at integer multiples of the frequency of the period. In weakly nonlinear systems or systems close to the primary instability threshold, the periodicity may be perturbed, resulting in deviations from the Dirac comb. We review and discuss a stochastic model of such semiperiodic fluctuations, while also providing several new results which widen the applicability of the model.The fluctuations are described as a superposition of pulses with a fixed shape.Closed form expressions are derived for the frequency power spectral density in the case of periodic pulse arrivals and a random distribution of pulse amplitudes and durations.In general, the spectrum is a Dirac comb located at multiples of the inverse periodicity time and modulated by the pulse spectrum. Deviations from strict periodicity in the arrivals are considered in two ways: either as a random offset to each periodic arrival (jitter) or as independently distributed waiting times between arrivals (renewal). In this contribution, we show that both ways of including deviations from periodicity remove the Dirac comb with remarkable efficiency, leaving mainly the spectrum of the pulse function.Where the jitter process modulates the mass of the higher harmonics, the renewal process leads to spectral broadening.We clarify the effects of random pulse amplitudes on the frequency power spectrum and demonstrate the applicability of normally distributed waiting times to modeling. Contrary to the previous literature, we argue that negative waiting times do not pose problems for the theory, broadening the applicability of the normal approximation.Randomness in the pulse arrival times is investigated by numerical realizations of the process, and the model is used to describe time series of kinetic energy of fluctuating motions in two-dimensional thermal convection.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <title>Critically Slow Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Quantum Morphic Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [arXiv:1701.07596], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: The time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity. Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is, in fact, exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.</description>
