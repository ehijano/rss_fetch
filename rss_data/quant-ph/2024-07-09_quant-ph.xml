      <title>Quantum Machine Learning with Application to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Network Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and quantum computing are being progressively explored to shed light on possible computational approaches to deal with hitherto unsolvable problems. Classical methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being a prominent technique for network classification. However, there are limitations to the successful resolution of such classification instances when the input feature space becomes large, and the successive evaluation of so-called kernel functions becomes computationally exorbitant. The use of principal component analysis (PCA) substantially minimizes the dimensionality of feature space thereby enabling computational speed-ups of supervised learning: the creation of a classifier. Further, the application of quantum-based learning to the PCA reduced input feature space might offer an exponential speedup with fewer parameters. The present learning model is evaluated on a real clinical application: the diagnosis of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) disorder. The results suggest that quantum machine learning has led to noticeable advancement and outperforms classical frameworks. The optimized variational quantum classifier classifies the PSP dataset with 86% accuracy as compared to conventional SVM. The other technique, a quantum kernel estimator, approximates the kernel function on the quantum machine and optimizes a classical SVM. In particular, we have demonstrated the successful application of the present model on both a quantum simulator and real chips of the IBM quantum platform.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend scenarios: on what to condition and how to verify the predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner's friend experiment and its modern extensions display the ambiguity of the quantum mechanical description regarding the assignment of quantum states. While the friend applies the state-update rule to the system upon observing an outcome of her measurement in a quantum system, Wigner describes the friend's measurement as a unitary evolution, resulting in an entangled state for the composite system of the friend and the system. In this respect, Wigner is often referred to as a "superobserver" who has the supreme technological ability to keep the friend's laboratory coherent. As such, it is often argued that he has the "correct" description of the state. Here we show that the situation is more symmetrical than is usually thought: there are different types of information that each of the observers has that the other fundamentally cannot have - they reside in different "bubbles" (in Calvalcanti's terminology). While this can explain why the objectivity of the state assignment is only relative to the bubble, we consider more elaborated situations in form of a game in which the players can switch between bubbles. We find that, in certain circumstances, observers may be entitled to adopt and verify the state assignment from another bubble if they condition their predictions on all information that is in principle available to them.</description>

      <title>Many-body Liouvillian dynamics with a non-Hermitian tensor-network kernel polynomial algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Passive photonic CZ gate with two-level emitters in chiral multi-mode waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering deterministic photonic gates with simple resources is one of the long-standing challenges in photonic quantum computing. Here, we design a passive conditional gate between co-propagating photons using an array of only two-level emitters. The key resource is to harness the effective photon-photon interaction induced by the chiral coupling of the emitter array to two waveguide modes with different resonant momenta at the emitter's transition frequency. By studying the system's multi-photon scattering response, we demonstrate that, in certain limits, this configuration induces a non-linear $\pi$-phase shift between the polariton eigenstates of the system without distorting spectrally the wavepackets. Then, we show how to harness this non-linear phase shift to engineer a conditional, deterministic photonic gate in different qubit encodings, with a fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 in the limit of large number of emitters and coupling efficiency. Our configuration can be implemented in topological photonic platforms with multiple chiral edge modes, opening their use for quantum information processing, or in other setups where such chiral multi-mode waveguide scenario can be obtained, e.g., in spin-orbit coupled optical fibers or photonic crystal waveguides.</description>

      <title>Gate-based quantum simulation of Gaussian bosonic circuits on exponentially many modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for simulating, on an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer, the action of a Gaussian Bosonic (GB) circuit on a state over $2^n$ modes. Specifically, we encode the initial bosonic state's expectation values over quadrature operators (and their covariance matrix) as an input qubit-state. This is then evolved by a quantum circuit that effectively implements the symplectic propagators induced by the GB gates. We find families of GB circuits and initial states leading to efficient quantum simulations. For this purpose, we introduce a dictionary that maps between GB and qubit gates such that particle- (non-particle-) preserving GB gates lead to real (imaginary) time evolutions at the qubit level. For the special case of particle-preserving circuits, we present a BQP-complete GB decision problem, indicating that GB evolutions of Gaussian states on exponentially many modes are as powerful as universal quantum computers. We also perform numerical simulations of an interferometer on $\sim8$ billion modes, illustrating the power of our framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Loss-resilient, efficient x-ray interaction-free measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction-free measurement (IFM) is a promising technique for low-dose detection and imaging, offering the unique advantage of probing an object without absorption of the interrogating photons. We propose an experiment to demonstrate IFM in the single x-ray photon regime. The proposed scheme relies on the triple-Laue (LLL) symmetric x-ray interferometer, where each Laue diffraction acts as a lossy beamsplitter. In contrast to many quantum effects which are highly vulnerable to loss, we show that an experimental demonstration of this effect in the x-ray regime is feasible and can achieve high IFM efficiency even in the presence of substantial loss in the system. The latter aspect is claimed to be a general property of IFM based on our theoretical analysis. We scrutinize two suitable detection schemes that offer efficiencies of up to $\eta\sim \frac{1}{2}$. The successful demonstration of IFM with x-rays promises intriguing possibilities for measurements with reduced dose, mainly advantageous for biological samples, where radiation damage is a significant limitation.</description>

      <title>A Scalable FPGA Architecture for Quantum Computing Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum computing simulation provides the opportunity to explore the behaviors of quantum circuits, study the properties of quantum gates, and develop quantum computing algorithms. Simulating quantum circuits requires geometric time and space complexities, impacting the size of the quantum circuit that can be simulated as well as the respective time required to simulate a particular circuit. Applying the parallelism inherent in the simulation and crafting custom architectures, larger quantum circuits can be simulated. A scalable accelerator architecture is proposed to provide a high performance, highly parallel, accelerator. Among the challenges of creating a scalable architecture is managing parallelism, efficiently routing quantum state components for gate evaluation, and measurement. An example is demonstrated on an Intel Agilex field programmable gate array (FPGA).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum architecture for vectorised image classification of hand-written sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) investigates how quantum phenomena can be exploited in order to learn data in an alternative way, \textit{e.g.} by means of a quantum computer. While recent results evidence that QML models can potentially surpass their classical counterparts' performance in specific tasks, quantum technology hardware is still unready to reach quantum advantage in tasks of significant relevance to the broad scope of the computer science community. Recent advances indicate that hybrid classical-quantum models can readily attain competitive performances at low architecture complexities. Such investigations are often carried out for image-processing tasks, and are notably constrained to modelling \textit{raster images}, represented as a grid of two-dimensional pixels. Here, we introduce vector-based representation of sketch drawings as a test-bed for QML models. Such a lower-dimensional data structure results handful to benchmark model's performance, particularly in current transition times, where classical simulations of quantum circuits are naturally limited in the number of qubits, and quantum hardware is not readily available to perform large-scale experiments. We report some encouraging results for primitive hybrid classical-quantum architectures, in a canonical sketch recognition problem.</description>

      <title>Censorship of Quantum Resources in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We may soon see agencies offering public access to quantum communication networks. In such networks it may be a feature that certain resources are available only to priority users or at a higher user fee, as governed by a protective agency overseeing the communication in the network. If the agency wants to restrict the general users to communicate by transmitting states that we categorize as free states of a quantum resource theory (QRT), it may employ resource-destroying (RD) channels that do not affect the free states. Such channels, however, only exist for the simplest of QRTs, putting fundamental limitations on how quantum resources can be regulated. In this work, we go beyond the present limitation by devising a nonlinear censorship protocol which makes use of classical information about the transmitted state. We study the requirement disabling malicious users from breaking the censorship. The protocol can establish an unbreakable censorship of imaginarity and entanglement, while no such censorship can be made for quantum discord and Bell nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computing to address complex problems requiring high computational resources has long been hindered by the intrinsic and demanding requirements of quantum hardware development. Nonetheless, the current state of quantum computing, denominated Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, has introduced algorithms and methods that are able to harness the computational power of current quantum computers with advantages over classical computers (referred to as quantum advantage). Achieving quantum advantage is of particular relevance for the combinatorial optimization domain, since it often implies solving an NP-Hard optimization problem. Moreover, combinatorial problems are highly relevant for practical application areas, such as operations research, or resource allocation problems. Among quantum computing methods, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) have emerged as one of the strongest candidates towards reaching practical applicability of NISQ systems. This paper explores the current state and recent developments of VQAs, emphasizing their applicability to combinatorial optimization. We identify the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as the leading candidate for these problems. Furthermore, we implement QAOA circuits with varying depths to solve the MaxCut problem on graphs with 10 and 20 nodes, demonstrating the potential and challenges of using VQAs in practical optimization tasks. We release our code, dataset and optimized circuit parameters under https://github.com/DanielFPerez/VQA-for-MaxCut.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency tuning of tunable transmon qubits using alternating-bias assisted annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are one of the leading platforms for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The recent demonstration of post-fabrication tuning of Josephson junctions using alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique and a reduction in junction loss after ABAA illuminates a promising path towards precision tuning of qubit frequency while maintaining high coherence. Here, we demonstrate precision tuning of the maximum $|0\rangle\rightarrow |1\rangle$ transition frequency ($f_{01}^{\rm max}$) of tunable transmon qubits by performing ABAA at room temperature using commercially available test equipment. We characterize the impact of junction relaxation and aging on resistance spread after tuning, and demonstrate a frequency equivalent tuning precision of 7.7 MHz ($0.17\%$) based on targeted resistance tuning on hundreds of qubits, with a resistance tuning range up to $18.5\%$. Cryogenic measurements on tuned and untuned qubits show evidence of improved coherence after ABAA with no significant impact on tunability. Despite a small global offset, we show an empirical $f_{01}^{\rm max}$ tuning precision of 18.4 MHz by tuning a set of multi-qubit processors targeting their designed Hamiltonians. We experimentally characterize high-fidelity parametric resonance iSWAP gates on two ABAA-tuned 9-qubit processors with fidelity as high as $99.51\pm 0.20\%$. On the best-performing device, we measured across the device a median fidelity of $99.22\%$ and an average fidelity of $99.13\pm 0.12 \%$. Yield modeling analysis predicts high detuning-edge-yield using ABAA beyond the 1000-qubit scale. These results demonstrate the cutting-edge capability of frequency targeting using ABAA and open up a new avenue to systematically improving Hamiltonian targeting and optimization for scaling high-performance superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum ergodicity of unitary evolution through the Krylov approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been growing interest in characterizing the complexity of quantum evolutions of interacting many-body systems. When the dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful tool. For unitary evolutions like kicked systems or Trotterized dynamics, a similar formulation based on the Arnoldi approach has been proposed (P. Suchsland, R. Moessner, and P. W. Claeys, (2023), arXiv:2308.03851). In this work, we show that this formulation is robust for observing the transition from integrability to chaos in both autonomous and kicked systems. Examples from random matrix theory and spin chains are shown in this paper.</description>

      <title>Noise-tolerant public-key quantum money from a classical oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum money is the task of verifying the validity of banknotes while ensuring that they cannot be counterfeited. Public-key quantum money allows anyone to perform verification, while the private-key setting restricts the ability to verify to banks, as in Wiesner's original scheme. The current state of technological progress means that errors are impossible to entirely suppress, hence the requirement for noise-tolerant schemes. We show for the first time how to achieve noise-tolerance in the public-key setting. Our techniques follow Aaronson and Christiano's oracle model, where we use the ideas of quantum error correction to extend their scheme: a valid banknote is now a subspace state possibly affected by noise, and verification is performed by using classical oracles to check for membership in "larger spaces." Additionally, a banknote in our scheme is minted by preparing conjugate coding states and applying a unitary that permutes the standard basis vectors.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Differentiation of Worldline Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldline method is a powerful numerical path-integral framework for computing Casimir and Casimir-Polder energies. An important challenge arises when one desires derivatives of path-integral quantities--standard finite-difference techniques, for example, yield results of poor accuracy. In this work we present methods for computing derivatives of worldline-type path integrals of scalar fields to calculate forces, energy curvatures, and torques. In Casimir-Polder-type path integrals, which require derivatives with respect to the source point of the paths, the derivatives can be computed by a simple reweighting of the path integral. However, a partial-averaging technique is necessary to render the differentiated path integral computationally efficient. We also discuss the computation of Casimir forces, curvatures, and torques between macroscopic bodies. Here a different method is used, involving summing over the derivatives of all the intersections with a body; again, a different partial-averaging method makes the path integral efficient. To demonstrate the efficiency of the techniques, we give the results of numerical implementations of these worldline methods in atomplane and plane-plane geometries. Being quite general, the methods here should apply to path integrals outside the worldline context (e.g., financial mathematics).</description>

      <title>Erasing Doppler Dephasing Error in Rydberg Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doppler dephasing error due to residual thermal motion of qubit atoms is a major cause of fidelity loss in neutral-atom quantum gates. Besides cooling and trapping advancements, few effective methods exist to mitigate this error. In the present work, we introduce an error-erasing strategy that utilizes a pair of off-resonant fields to continuously dress the protected Rydberg state with an auxiliary state, which induces an opposite but enhanced sensitivity to the same source of Doppler dephasing error. Combining with an optimal control of laser pulses, we realize a family of Rydberg two-qubit controlled-NOT gates in Rb and Cs atoms that are fully robust to the Doppler dephasing error. We benchmark this gate operation with fidelity $F\approx0.9906$ at ${\it any}$ temperature for a lower-excited auxiliary state, and a higher fidelity of $F\approx0.9965$ can be attained for a ground-state auxiliary state at a temperature of 50 $\mu$K. Our results significantly reduce atomic temperature requirements for high-fidelity quantum gates, and may provide fundamental guidance to practical error-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Lamb Shift Breaks the Heat Current Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lamb shift by considering the steady-state heat current through two coupled two-level atoms, which, respectively, interact with a heat reservoir at a certain temperature. It is found that the Lamb shift significantly alters the energy levels. In particular, it is shown that the heat current will approach an upper bound if the Lamb shift isn't considered, while the heat current will break the upper bound if the Lamb shift is considered. This finding can deepen our understanding of Lamb shift in the quantum thermodynamic field.</description>

      <title>Majorana Tensor Decomposition: A unifying framework for decompositions of fermionic Hamiltonians to Linear Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>

      <title>Low-cost noise reduction for Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) scheme that provides a reduction of the logical error rate of Clifford circuit with lower overhead than error correction and without the exponential sampling overhead of error mitigation. CliNR implements Clifford circuits by splitting them into sub-circuits that are performed using gate teleportation. A few random stabilizer measurements are used to detect errors in the resources states consumed by the gate teleportation. This can be seen as a teleported version of the CPC scheme, with offline fault-detection making it scalable. We prove that CliNR achieves a vanishing logical error rate for families of $n$-qubit Clifford circuits with size $s$ such that $nsp^2$ goes to 0, where $p$ is the physical error rate, meaning that it reaches the regime $ns = o(1/p^2)$ whereas the direct implementation is limited to $s = o(1/p)$. Moreover, CliNR uses only $3n+1$ qubits, $2s + o(s)$ gates and has zero rejection rate. This small overhead makes it more practical than quantum error correction in the near term and our numerical simulations show that CliNR provides a reduction of the logical error rate in relevant noise regimes.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Method for Simulating Lindblad Equations and Thermal State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate the Lindblad equations. For Lindblad dynamics generated by an ensemble of Lindbladians $\{\mathcal{L}_a\}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}$, our approach implements a single randomly sampled Lindbladian $\mathcal{L}_a$ at each time step. The only assumption is that each $\mathcal{L}_a$ involves only a single jump operator with an efficient implementation available for the evolution $e^{t \mathcal{L}_a}$.
  A notable application of the randomized method is for quantum Gibbs sampling, where the Lindblad dynamics is utilized to prepare a specific Gibbs state. Unlike existing deterministic methods that require numerous jump operators to ensure ergodicity, our approach simplifies the implementation by using a single randomly sampled jump operator. As an example, we demonstrate that our method ensures fast thermalization of Hamiltonian systems characterized by random Pauli strings, where the spectral density closely adheres to the semi-circle law.</description>

      <title>Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, scientists are trying to improve the entanglement swapping success rate by researching anti-noise technology on the physical level, thereby obtaining a higher generation rate of long-distance entanglement. However, we may improve the generation rate from another perspective, which is studying an efficient entanglement swapping strategy. This paper analyzes the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping strategies, including the node allocation principle, time synchronization, and processing of entanglement swapping failure. We present Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping (PSES) to solve these problems. The core idea of PSES is to segment the path and perform parallel entanglement swapping between segments to improve the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. We construct a tree-like model as the carrier of PSES and propose heuristic algorithms called Layer Greedy and Segment Greedy to transform the path into a tree-like model. Moreover, we realize the time synchronization and design the on-demand retransmission mechanism to process entanglement swapping failure. The experiments show that PSES performs superiorly to other entanglement swapping strategies, and the on-demand retransmission mechanism can reduce the average entanglement swapping time by 80% and the average entanglement consumption by 80%.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence with generalized wave packets under Lorentz boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a single particle, apin-momentum entangled state and measure the effect of relativistic boost on quantum coherence. The effect of the relativistic boost on single-particle generalized Gaussian wave packets is studied. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with the increase in momentum of the state, as well as the boost applied to it. A more prominent loss of coherence due to relativistic boost is observed for a single particle electron than that of a neutron. The analysis is carried out with generalized Gaussian wave packet of the form $\sim p^n \exp(-\frac{p^2}{\sigma^2})$. We also obtain a bound on the unknown parameter $n$ appearing in the wave packet. It is found to have a dependence on the mass of the particle and the width of the Gaussian wave packet.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-photon directional transfer between waveguides via two giant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the single-photon transport properties in a double-waveguide quantum electrodynamic system. We force the energy degeneracy of the collective states by adjusting the direct coupling strength between the two giant atoms. Our results indicate that resonant photons can be completely transferred between the two waveguides owing to the scattering interference of eigenstates, which also results in the directional propagation of resonant photons in the output waveguide. Perfect transfer occurs when the two scattering states degenerate in the energy and decay rates. We further propose a simple scheme to realize the efficient photon transfer with directional control. This study has potential applications in quantum networks and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Advantages of multistage quantum walks over QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods to find the solution state for optimization problems encoded into Ising Hamiltonians are a very active area of current research. In this work we compare the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with multi-stage quantum walks (MSQW). Both can be used as variational quantum algorithms, where the control parameters are optimized classically. A fair comparison requires both quantum and classical resources to be assessed. Alternatively, parameters can be chosen heuristically, as we do in this work, providing a simpler setting for comparisons. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we obtain evidence that MSQW outperforms QAOA, using equivalent resources. We also show numerically for random spin glass ground state problems that MSQW performs well even for few stages and heuristic parameters, with no classical optimization.</description>

      <title>Polar Duality and Quasi-States: a Geometric Picture of Quantum Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to suggest a new interpretation of quantum indeterminacy using the notion of polar duality from convex geometry. Our approach does not involve the usual variances and covariances, whose use to describe quantum uncertainties has been questioned by Uffink and Hilgevoord. We introduce instead the geometric notion of "quasi-states" which are related in a way that will be explained to the notion of "quantum blob" we have introduced in previous work. Considering the symmetries of the quasi-states leads to the definition of the canonical group of a quasi-state, which allows to classify them.</description>

      <title>Realization of Conditional Operations through Transition Pathway Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, achieving large-scale quantum computing demands compact circuits to mitigate decoherence and gate error accumulation. Quantum operations with diverse degrees of freedom hold promise for circuit compression, but conventional approaches encounter challenges in simultaneously adjusting multiple parameters. Here, we propose a transition composite gate (TCG) scheme grounded on state-selective transition path engineering, enabling more expressive conditional operations. We experimentally validate a controlled unitary (CU) gate as an example, with independent and continuous parameters. By adjusting the parameters of $\rm X^{12}$ gate, we obtain the CU family with a fidelity range of 95.2% to 99.0% leveraging quantum process tomography (QPT). To demonstrate the capability of circuit compression, we use TCG scheme to prepare 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states, with the fidelity of 96.77% and 95.72%. TCG can achieve the reduction in circuit depth of about 40% and 44% compared with the use of CZ gates only. Moreover, we show that short-path TCG (SPTCG) can further reduce the state-preparation circuit time cost. The TCG scheme exhibits advantages in certain quantum circuits and shows significant potential for large-scale quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Local Decay in non-Markovian Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms coupled to the same environment interfere with each other to yield super- or sub-radiance. Specifically, atoms in subradiant states are promising candidates for long-lifetime qubits and quantum memory because of the immunity to the common environment. However, subradiant states can still be influenced by local environments, which are incoherent for different atoms and cannot be canceled out through interference. Here we propose to break this limit by preparing a waveguide QED system in the non-Markovian regime, where the ultra-small decay rate arises because of the retarded interaction. We further show that similar effect occurs spontaneously by self-interference and can be stressed by cooperative coupling.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Quantum Optimization for Dynamic Self-Reliant Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grid partitioning is an important requirement for resilient distribution grids. Since electricity production is progressively shifted to the distribution side, dynamic identification of self-reliant grid subsets becomes crucial for operation. This problem can be represented as a modification to the well-known NP-hard Community Detection (CD) problem. We formulate it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem suitable for solving using quantum computation{\color{blue}, which is expected to find better-quality partitions faster. The formulation aims to find communities with maximal self-sufficiency and minimal power flowing between them}. To assess quantum optimization for sizeable problems, we develop a hierarchical divisive method that solves sub-problem QUBOs to perform grid bisections. Furthermore, we propose a customization of the Louvain heuristic that includes self-reliance. In the evaluation, we first demonstrate that this problem examines exponential runtime scaling classically. Then, using different IEEE power system test cases, we benchmark the solution quality for multiple approaches: D-Wave's hybrid quantum-classical solvers, classical heuristics, and a branch-and-bound solver. As a result, we observe that the hybrid solvers provide very promising results, both with and without the divisive algorithm, regarding solution quality achieved within a given time frame. Directly utilizing D-Wave's Quantum Annealing (QA) hardware shows inferior partitioning.</description>

      <title>Certifying measurement incompatibility in prepare-and-measure and Bell scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of certifying measurement incompatibility in a prepare-and-measure (PM) scenario. We present different families of sets of qubit measurements which are incompatible, but cannot lead to any quantum over classical advantage in PM scenarios. Our examples are obtained via a general theorem which proves a set of qubit dichotomic measurements can have their incompatibility certified in a PM scenario if and only if their incompatibility can be certified in a bipartite Bell scenario where the parties share a maximally entangled state. Our framework naturally suggests a hierarchy of increasingly stronger notions of incompatibility, in which more power is given to the classical simulation by increasing its dimensionality. For qubits, we give an example of measurements whose incompatibility can be certified against trit simulations, which we show is the strongest possible notion for qubits in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum energy science is rapidly emerging as a domain interested in the generation, transfer and storage of energy at the quantum level. In particular, quantum batteries have the scope to exploit the wonders of quantum mechanics in order to boost their performance as compared to their electrochemical equivalents. Here we show how an exponential enhancement in stored energy can be achieved with a quantum battery thanks to a two-photon charging protocol. We consider theoretically a quantum battery modelled as a quantum harmonic oscillator, which when driven by a quadratic field (manifested by a Gaussian pulse envelope) gives rise to squeezing of the battery. This quantum squeezing ensures that the population of the battery is driven exponentially up its bosonic energy ladder. Our results demonstrate a plausible mechanism for quickly storing a vast amount of energy in a quantum object defined by continuous variables, which may be explored experimentally in a variety of quantum optical platforms.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in entanglement-based quantum metrology have been significant. A fundamental connection between generalized cat states and sensitivity in quantum metrology has recently been established. Generalized cat states are characterized by an index indicating coherence among macroscopically distinct states. This criterion enables the identification of diverse states as generalized cat states, encompassing classical mixtures of exponentially large numbers of states. However, preparing large generalized cat states remains challenging with current technology. Here we propose a protocol to generate metrologically useful cat states through repetitive measurements on a quantum spin system of N spins, which we call a spin ensemble. The states used as sensors to beat the classical limit are called the metrologically useful cat states, which are well characterized by the index to indicate the coherence between macroscopically distinct states. When the spin ensemble is collectively coupled with an ancillary qubit, it allows for the read out of its total magnetization. Starting from a thermal equilibrium state of the spin ensemble, we demonstrate that we can increase the coherence between the spin ensemble via repetitive measurements of the total magnetization using the ancillary qubit. Notably, our method for creating the metrologically useful cat states requires no control over the spin ensemble. As a potential experimental realization, we discuss a hybrid system composed of a superconducting flux qubit and donor spins in silicon. Our results pave the way for the realization of the entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Perturbative approach to time-dependent quantum systems and applications to one-crossing multistate Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a perturbative approach for studying a class of multi-level time-dependent quantum systems with constant off-diagonal couplings and diabatic energies being odd functions of time. Applying this approach to a general multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing at one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas of all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. These analytical asymptotic solutions at the diabatic limit can serve as reliable benchmarks for future studies of any unsolved one-crossing MLZ models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Query-Space Lower Bounds Using Branching Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching programs are quite popular for studying time-space lower bounds. Bera et al. recently introduced the model of generalized quantum branching program aka. GQBP that generalized two earlier models of quantum branching programs. In this work we study a restricted version of GQBP with the motivation of proving bounds on the query-space requirement of quantum-query circuits. We show the first explicit query-space lower bound for our restricted version. We prove that the well-studied OR$_n$ decision problem, given a promise that at most one position of an $n$-sized Boolean array is a 1, satisfies the bound $Q^2 s = \Omega(n^2)$, where $Q$ denotes the number of queries and $s$ denotes the width of the GQBP. We then generalize the problem to show that the same bound holds for deciding between two strings with a constant Hamming distance; this gives us query-space lower bounds on problems such as Parity and Majority. Our results produce an alternative proof of the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-lower bound on the query complexity of any non-constant symmetric Boolean function.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable unitary transformations of optical beam arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transformations of light are ubiquitous in optics, with examples ranging from simple imaging with a lens to quantum and classical information processing in waveguide meshes. Multi-plane light converter (MPLC) systems have emerged as a platform that promises completely general spatial transformations, i.e., a universal unitary. However until now, MPLC systems have demonstrated transformations that are far from general, e.g., converting from a Gaussian to Laguerre-Gauss mode. Here, we demonstrate the promise of an MLPC, the ability to impose an arbitrary unitary transformation that can be reconfigured dynamically. Specifically, we consider transformations on superpositions of parallel free-space beams arranged in an array, which is a common information encoding in photonics. We experimentally test the full gamut of unitary transformations for a system of two parallel beams and make a map of their fidelity. We obtain an average transformation fidelity of $0.85 \pm 0.03$. This high-fidelity suggests MPLCs are a useful tool implementing the unitary transformations that comprise quantum and classical information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weak values in the Feynman propagator framework, to gain a broader understanding of their interpretation in terms of path integrals. In particular, we examine the phenomenon of seemingly discontinuous paths that particles take in nested Mach-Zender interferometer experiments. We extend on existing path integral approaches for weak values by deriving expressions to model a sequence of weak measurements, and study the probe shifts across the different branches of a weak value interferometer. We apply this to scrutinise two scenarios of interest, one which treats photons as measurement apparatus via their spatial projection operators, and the second treating mirrors as probes.</description>

      <title>Molecular Nanomagnet $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ as Resource for Quantum Entanglement, Coherence, and Spin Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, and spin squeezing with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_23\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $50\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. In addition, we investigate the spin squeezing parameter within thermal states of the spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer. Our exact results reveal optimal conditions for achieving the highest degree of the spin squeezing, which are achieved at zero magnetic field around $T \approx 30\,\text{K}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active imaging protocols, information about a landscape is encoded into the spatial mode of a scattered photon. A common assumption is that the landscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation pressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum optomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an eye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially multimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the limit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with high-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial relative phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves at the Boltzmann equilibrium, that intrinsically measures zero average phases for each of the two independent condensates. Following this approach, focus is put on the original Gedanken experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the explicit breaking of a $SU(2)$ symmetry to a $U(1)$ subgroup employing the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that measures how much symmetries are broken in a part of extended quantum systems. We consider as specific model the critical XXZ spin chain, which breaks the $SU(2)$ symmetry of spin rotations except at the isotropic point, and is described by the massless compact boson in the continuum limit. We examine the $U(1)$ subgroup of $SU(2)$ that is broken outside the isotropic point by applying conformal perturbation theory, which we complement with numerical simulations on the lattice. We also analyse the entanglement asymmetry of the full $SU(2)$ group. By relying on very generic scaling arguments, we derive an asymptotic expression for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the analysis of interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover for finite size and temperature by using field-theory approach (bosonization) and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Stemming from the fact that finite size low-dimensional systems are allowed only to have quasi-ordered phase, we consider the self-consistent harmonic approximation to compute the fraction of quasi-condensate and its scaling with the system size. It allows us to understand the important role played by finite size and temperature across the dimensional crossover for deciding the condensate nature. Furthermore, we consider a mean-field approximation to compute the finite size effect on the crossover temperature for both weak and strong interaction. All the physical quantities we discuss here provide essential information for quantum gas at dimensional crossover and are directly detectable in cold atom experiments</description>

      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians for Quantum Systems with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, \emph{i.e.}, when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Mixing using an NV Diamond Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-field magnetic microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can yield high-quality magnetic images of DC and AC magnetic fields. The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as adiabatic quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or symmetry-forbidden transitions. We uncover a new mechanism for topological protection via the observation of quantized currents which survive the addition of bounded local disorder large enough to close the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. Using a local picture in configuration-space based on Landau-Zener transitions, we show that in this case the topological protection does not depend on the spectral gaps, but rather on the number of states in an occupied band and the position of the band in configuration space. Moreover, we propose a protocol, realizable in cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern number and open new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

Abstract: A number of recent studies have proposed that linear representations are appropriate for solving nonlinear dynamical systems with quantum computers, which fundamentally act linearly on a wave function in a Hilbert space. Linear representations, such as the Koopman representation and Koopman von Neumann mechanics, have regained attention from the dynamical-systems research community. Here, we aim to present a unified theoretical framework, currently missing in the literature, with which one can compare and relate existing methods, their conceptual basis, and their representations. We also aim to show that, despite the fact that quantum simulation of nonlinear classical systems may be possible with such linear representations, a necessary projection into a feasible finite-dimensional space will in practice eventually induce numerical artifacts which can be hard to eliminate or even control. As a result, a practical, reliable and accurate way to use quantum computation for solving general nonlinear dynamical systems is still an open problem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted quantum speedup: Beating local quantum speed limits</title>

Abstract: Research in quantum information science aims to surpass the scaling limitations of classical information processing. From a physicist's perspective, performance improvement involves a physical speedup in the quantum domain, achieved by dynamically exploiting quantum correlations. In this study, speed limits in interacting quantum systems are derived by comparing the rates of change in actual quantum dynamics with the quasi-classical evolution confined to the manifold of non-entangled separable states. The utility of the resulting bounds on entanglement-assisted speedup is demonstrated on bipartite qubit systems, bipartite qudit systems, as well as a complex multimode systems. Specifically, the proposed speed limits provide a tight bound on quantum speed advantage, including a quantum gain that can scale exponentially with the system's size. Extensions of the results to open systems and measurable witnesses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scalable Determination of Multipartite Entanglement in Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum networks comprised of entangled end nodes serve stronger than the classical correlation for unparalleled quantum internet applications. However, practical quantum networking is affected by noise, which at its worst, causes end nodes to be described by pre-existing classical data. In such untrusted networks, determining quantum network fidelity and genuine multi-node entanglement becomes crucial. Here, we show that determining quantum network fidelity and genuine $N$-node entanglement in an untrusted star network requires only $N+1$ measurement settings. This method establishes a semi-trusted framework, allowing some nodes to relax their assumptions. Our network determination method is enabled by detecting genuine $N$-node Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability. Experimentally, using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources, we demonstrate the determinations of genuine 3-photon and 4-photon quantum networks and the false positives of the widely used entanglement witness, the fidelity criterion of $1/2$. Our results provide a scalable method for the determination of multipartite entanglement in realistic quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: The study of quantum information processing seeks to characterize the resources that enable quantum information processing to perform tasks that are unfeasible or inefficient for classical information processing. Quantum cryptography is one such task, and researchers have identified entanglement as a sufficient resource for secure key generation. However, quantum discord, another type of quantum correlation beyond entanglement, has been found to be necessary for guaranteeing secure communication due to its direct relation to information leakage. Despite this, it is a long-standing problem how to make use of discord to analyze security in a specific quantum cryptography protocol. Here, based on our proposed quantum discord witness recently, we successfully address this issue by considering a BB84-like quantum key distribution protocol and its equivalent entanglement-based version. Our method is robust against imperfections in qubit sources and qubit measurements as well as basis misalignment due to quantum channels, which results in a better key rate than standard BB84 protocol. Those advantages are experimentally demonstrated via photonic phase encoding systems, which shows the practicality of our results.</description>

      <title>Signature of chaos in perturbed quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14272v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have concluded that \textit{Out-of-Time-Order-Correlator} (OTOC) shows exponential growth in the neighbourhood of a local maximum of a potential. If this statement holds true, the exponential growth should break off once the local maximum is no longer present within the system. By applying a small symmetry-breaking perturbation, we notice that the behaviour of the OTOCs remains remarkably resilient even in the absence of a maximum. Besides this, we also notice that with the increase in perturbation strength, the broken symmetric region expands, causing a broader range of eigenstates to engage in the exponential growth of OTOCs. Therefore, the critical factor lies not in the presence of a local maximum, but in the dynamic nature of the density of states in the broken symmetry regions. Our examination, spanning diverse potential landscapes, reveals the universality of this phenomenon. We also use other chaos diagnostic tool, \textit{Loschmidt Echo} (LE). Interestingly, they also show signature of chaos whenever there is an exponential growth of OTOC.</description>

Abstract: Models for open quantum systems, which play important roles in electron transport problems and quantum computing, must take into account the interaction of the quantum system with the surrounding environment. Although such models can be derived in some special cases, in most practical situations, the exact models are unknown and have to be calibrated. This paper presents a learning method to infer parameters in Markovian open quantum systems from measurement data. One important ingredient in the method is a direct simulation technique of the quantum master equation, which is designed to preserve the completely-positive property with guaranteed accuracy. The method is particularly helpful in the situation where the time intervals between measurements are large. The approach is validated with error estimates and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Quantum Gate Errors for Variational Eigensolvers Using Hardware-Inspired Zero-Noise Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithms research. Practical implementations of these algorithms, despite offering certain levels of robustness against systematic errors, show a decline in performance due to the presence of stochastic errors and limited coherence time. In this work, we develop a recipe for mitigating quantum gate errors for variational algorithms using zero-noise extrapolation. We introduce an experimentally amenable method to control error strength in the circuit. We utilize the fact that gate errors in a physical quantum device are distributed inhomogeneously over different qubits and qubit pairs. As a result, one can achieve different circuit error sums based on the manner in which abstract qubits in the circuit are mapped to a physical device. We find that the estimated energy in the variational approach is approximately linear with respect to the circuit error sum (CES). Consequently, a linear fit through the energy-CES data, when extrapolated to zero CES, can approximate the energy estimated by a noiseless variational algorithm. We demonstrate this numerically and investigate the applicability range of the technique.</description>

Abstract: Distributed quantum information in networks is paramount for global secure quantum communication. Moreover, it finds applications as a resource for relevant tasks, such as clock synchronization, magnetic field sensing, and blind quantum computation. For quantum network analysis and benchmarking of implementations, however, it is crucial to characterize the topology of networks in a way that reveals the nodes between which entanglement can be reliably distributed. Here, we demonstrate an efficient scheme for this topology certification. Our scheme allows for distinguishing, in a scalable manner, different networks consisting of bipartite and multipartite entanglement sources. It can be applied to semi-device independent scenarios also, where the measurement devices and network nodes are not well characterized and trusted. We experimentally demonstrate our approach by certifying the topology of different six-qubit networks generated with polarized photons, employing active feed-forward and time multiplexing. Our methods can be used for general simultaneous tests of multiple hypotheses with few measurements, being useful for other certification scenarios in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of mean force is an effective Hamiltonian that allows a quantum system, non-weakly coupled to an environment, to be written in an effective Gibbs state. We present results on the structure of the Hamiltonian of mean force in extended quantum systems with local interactions. We show that its spatial structure exhibits a ``skin effect'' -- its difference from the system Hamiltonian dies off exponentially with distance from the system-environment boundary. For spin systems, we identify the terms that can appear in the Hamiltonian of mean force at different orders in the inverse temperature.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental observations of dilute ion spin ensemble defects in a low-loss single crystal cylindrical sample of CaWO$_4$ cooled to 30 mK in temperature. Crystal field perturbations were elucidated by constructing a dielectrically loaded microwave cavity resonator from the crystal. The resonator exhibited numerous whispering gallery modes with high Q-factors of up to $3\times 10^7$, equivalent to a low loss tangent of $\sim 3\times 10^{-8}$. The low-loss allowed precision multi-mode spectroscopy of numerous high Q-factor photon-spin interactions. Measurements between 7 to 22 GHz revealed the presence of Gd$^{3+}$, Fe$^{3+}$, and another trace species, inferred to be rare-earth, at concentrations on the order of parts per billion. These findings motivate further exploration of prospective uses of this low-loss dielectric material for applications regarding precision and quantum metrology, as well as tests for beyond standard model physics.</description>

Abstract: The vacuum beam guide (VBG) presents a completely different solution for quantum channels to overcome the limitations of existing fiber and satellite technologies for long-distance quantum communication. With an array of aligned lenses spaced kilometers apart, the VBG offers ultra-high transparency over a wide range of optical wavelengths. With realistic parameters, the VBG can outperform the best fiber by three orders of magnitude in terms of attenuation rate. Consequently, the VBG can enable long-range quantum communication over thousands of kilometers with quantum channel capacity beyond $10^{13}$ qubit/sec, orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art quantum satellite communication rate. Remarkably, without relying on quantum repeaters, the VBG can provide a ground-based, low-loss, high-bandwidth quantum channel that enables novel distributed quantum information applications for computing, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Faithful geometric measures for genuine tripartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a faithful geometric picture for genuine tripartite entanglement of discrete, continuous, and hybrid quantum systems. We first find that the triangle relation $\mathcal{E}^\alpha_{i|jk}\leq \mathcal{E}^\alpha_{j|ik}+\mathcal{E}^\alpha_{k|ij}$ holds for all subadditive bipartite entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}$, all permutations under parties $i, j, k$, all $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, and all pure tripartite states. It provides a geometric interpretation that bipartition entanglement, measured by $\mathcal{E}^\alpha$, corresponds to the side of a triangle, of which the area with $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ is nonzero if and only if the underlying state is genuinely entangled. Then, we rigorously prove the non-obtuse triangle area with $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1/2$ is a measure for genuine tripartite entanglement. Useful lower and upper bounds for these measures are obtained, and generalizations of our results are also presented. Finally, it is significantly strengthened for qubits that, given a set of subadditive and non-additive measures, some state is always found to violate the triangle relation for any $\alpha&gt;1$, and the triangle area is not a measure for any $\alpha&gt;1/2$. Hence, our results are expected to aid significant progress in studying both discrete and continuous multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning for Parameter Transferability in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage through quantum-enhanced combinatorial optimization. Optimal QAOA parameter concentration effects for special MaxCut problem instances have been observed, but a rigorous study of the subject is still lacking. Due to clustering of optimal QAOA parameters for MaxCut, successful parameter transferability between different MaxCut instances can be explained and predicted based on local properties of the graphs, including the type of subgraphs (lightcones) from which graphs are composed as well as the overall degree of nodes in the graph (parity). In this work, we apply five different graph embedding techniques to determine good donor candidates for parameter transferability, including parameter transferability between different classes of MaxCut instances. Using this technique, we effectively reduce the number of iterations required for parameter optimization, obtaining an approximate solution to the target problem with an order of magnitude speedup. This procedure also effectively removes the problem of encountering barren plateaus during the variational optimization of parameters. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the transferred parameters maintain effectiveness when subjected to noise, supporting their use in real-world quantum applications. This work presents a framework for identifying classes of combinatorial optimization instances for which optimal donor candidates can be predicted such that QAOA can be substantially accelerated under both ideal and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum communication on the bosonic loss-dephasing channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optical systems are typically affected by two types of noise: photon loss and dephasing. Despite extensive research on each noise process individually, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effect is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of loss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or, alternatively, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture in [Quantum 6, 821 (2022)] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable if and only if the loss is above $50\%$. In this paper we refute this conjecture, specifically proving that for any value of the loss, if the dephasing is above a critical value, then the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is anti-degradable. While our result identifies a large parameter region where quantum communication is not possible, we also prove that if two-way classical communication is available, then quantum communication -- and thus quantum key distribution -- is always achievable, even for high values of loss and dephasing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.</description>

Abstract: Non-classical correlations generated within a quantum probe system when it interacts with a large, macroscopic system can signal the presence of quantum features in the latter. Theoretical models have considered how entanglement generated in photosynthetic bacteria can be probed using light that interacts with them. More recently, a tardigrade was entangled to a transmon qubit. We consider a detailed model including noise for such systems wherein a small quantum probe interacts with a large system in order to delineate the regimes with respect to coupling strengths and noise levels in which such signatures of quantumness in macroscopic systems can realistically be detected.</description>

Abstract: The research of architecture has tremendous significance in realizing quantum Internet. Although there is not yet a standard quantum Internet architecture, the distributed architecture is one of the possible solutions, which utilizes quantum repeaters or dedicated entanglement sources in a flat structure for entanglement preparation &amp; distribution. In this paper, we analyze the distributed architecture in detail and demonstrate that it has three limitations: 1) possible high maintenance overhead, 2) possible low-performance entanglement distribution, and 3) unable to support optimal entanglement routing. We design a hierarchical quantum Internet architecture and a communication model to solve the problems above. We also present a W-state Based Centralized Entanglement Preparation &amp; Distribution (W-state Based CEPD) scheme and a Centralized Entanglement Routing (CER) algorithm within our hierarchical architecture and perform an experimental comparison with other entanglement preparation &amp; distribution schemes and entanglement routing algorithms within the distributed architecture. The evaluation results show that the entanglement distribution efficiency of hierarchical architecture is 11.5% higher than that of distributed architecture on average (minimum 3.3%, maximum 37.3%), and the entanglement routing performance of hierarchical architecture is much better than that of a distributed architecture according to the fidelity and throughput.</description>

      <title>Probing Site-Resolved Current in Strongly Interacting Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport measurements are fundamental for understanding condensed matter phenomena, from superconductivity to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Analogously, they can be powerful tools for probing synthetic quantum matter in quantum simulators. Here we demonstrate the measurement of in-situ particle current in a superconducting circuit lattice and apply it to study transport in both coherent and bath-coupled lattices. Our method utilizes controlled tunneling in a double-well potential to map current to on-site density, revealing site-resolved current and current statistics. We prepare a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different lattice fillings, and observe the change in current statistics as the many-body states transition from superfluid to Mott insulator. Furthermore, we explore non-equilibrium current dynamics by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative baths that serve as tunable particle source and drain. We observe steady-state current in discrete conduction channels and interaction-assisted transport. These results establish a versatile platform to investigate microscopic quantum transport in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) outcomes in the presence of non-stationary noise, which is an obstacle to achieving accurate observable estimates. Leveraging Bayesian methods, we design a strategy to enhance PEC stability and accuracy. Our experiments using a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and conducted on the ibm_kolkata device reveal a 42% improvement in accuracy and a 60% enhancement in stability compared to non-adaptive PEC. These results underscore the importance of adaptive estimation processes to effectively address non-stationary noise, vital for advancing PEC utility.</description>

      <title>Time-adaptive phase estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase estimation is known to be a robust method for single-qubit gate calibration in quantum computers, while Bayesian estimation is widely used in devising optimal methods for learning in quantum systems. We present Bayesian phase estimation methods that adaptively choose a control phase and the time of coherent evolution based on prior phase knowledge. In the presence of noise, we find near-optimal performance with respect to known theoretical bounds, and demonstrate some robustness of the estimates to noise that is not accounted for in the model of the estimator, making the methods suitable for calibrating operations in quantum computers. We determine the utility of control parameter values using functions of the prior probability of the phase that quantify expected knowledge gain either in terms of expected narrowing of the posterior or expected information gain. In particular, we find that by maximising the rate of expected gain we obtain phase estimates having standard deviation a factor of 1.42 above the Heisenberg limit, which is the lowest value we know of for sequential phase estimation. The methods provide optimal solutions accounting for available prior knowledge and experimental imperfections with minimal effort from the user. The effect of many types of noise can be specified in the model of the measurement probabilities, and the rate of knowledge gain can easily be adjusted to account for times included in the measurement sequence other than the coherent evolution leading to the unknown phase, such as times required for state preparation or readout.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Criticality on an Analog-Digital Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Block encoding of sparse structured matrices coming from ocean acoustics in quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block encoding is a data input model commonly used in a quantum computer. It is an ingenious technique that embeds a matrix $A$ satisfying $\left\|A/ \alpha \right\| \leq 1$ into a larger unitary matrix $U_{A}$. Its complexity can affect the complexity of quantum algorithms in the framework of block encoding. In this paper, a new base scheme of block encoding is given which generalizes the one in \cite{camps2024explicit} by removing the constraint that every data item should appear in all columns. And applying preamplification and state preparation methods, the base scheme is further improved, which results in lower \textit{figures of merit} than that in special case \cite{sunderhauf2024block}. Then, the construction of oracles in block encoding schemes are discussed in detail. Considering special sparse structured matrices coming from ocean acoustics, two concrete examples are used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed base scheme of block encoding and their explicit quantum circuits are implemented. Finally, the corresponding \verb|MATLAB| codes are presented to effectively simulate the quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization using a 127-qubit gate-model IBM quantum computer can outperform quantum annealers for nontrivial binary optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive quantum solver for binary combinatorial optimization problems on gate-model quantum computers that outperforms any published alternative and consistently delivers correct solutions for problems with up to 127 qubits. We provide an overview of the internal workflow, describing the integration of a customized ansatz and variational parameter update strategy, efficient error suppression in hardware execution, and overhead-free post-processing to correct for bit-flip errors. We benchmark this solver on IBM quantum computers for several classically nontrivial unconstrained binary optimization problems -- the entire optimization is conducted on hardware with no use of classical simulation or prior knowledge of the solution. First, we demonstrate the ability to correctly solve Max-Cut instances for random regular graphs with a variety of densities using up to 120 qubits, where the graph topologies are not matched to device connectivity. Next, we apply the solver to higher-order binary optimization and successfully search for the ground state energy of a 127-qubit spin-glass model with linear, quadratic, and cubic interaction terms. Use of this new quantum solver increases the likelihood of finding the minimum energy by up to $\sim1,500\times$ relative to published results using a DWave annealer, and it can find the correct solution when the annealer fails. Furthermore, for both problem types, the Q-CTRL solver outperforms a heuristic local solver used to indicate the relative difficulty of the problems pursued. Overall, these results represent the largest quantum optimizations successfully solved on hardware to date, and demonstrate the first time a gate-model quantum computer has been able to outperform an annealer for a class of binary optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>EPR Steering Criterion and Monogamy Relation via Correlation Matrices in Tripartite Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum steering is considered as one of the most well-known nonlocal phenomena in quantum mechanics. Unlike entanglement and Bell non-locality, the asymmetry of quantum steering makes it vital for one-sided device-independent quantum information processing. Although there has been much progress on steering detection for bipartite systems, the criterion for EPR steering in tripartite systems remains challenging and inadequate. In this paper, we firstly derive a novel and promising steering criterion for any three-qubit states via correlation matrix. Furthermore, we propose the monogamy relation between the tripartite steering of system and the bipartite steering of subsystems based on the derived criterion. Finally, as illustrations, we demonstrate the performance of the steering criterion and the monogamy relation by means of several representative examples. We believe that the results and methods presented in this work could be beneficial to capture genuine multipartite steering in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an energy storage and extraction device conforming to the principles of quantum mechanics. In this study, we consider the characteristics of QBs for the Heisenberg spin chain models in the absence and presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Our results show that the DM interaction can enhance the ergotropy and power of QBs, which shows the collective charging can outperform parallel charging regarding QB's performance. Besides, it turns out that first-order coherence is a crucial quantum resource during charging, while quantum steering between the cells is not conducive to the energy storage of QBs. Our investigations offer insight into the properties of QBs with Heisenberg spin chain models with DM interaction and facilitate us to acquire the performance in the framework of realistic quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Decoherence without einselection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in a quantum measurement is typically explained as an interaction with the environment that destroys coherence between the system's eigenstates, a phenomenon known as environment-induced superselection (einselection). In this work, we demonstrate that einselection and the associated envariance are actually artifacts resulting from neglecting the non-equilibrium dynamics of the apparatus. We propose a new formalism of operator dressing, which we call the stochastic matrix integral (SMI), inspired by recent developments in quantum gravity algebras. This approach naturally arises from a modified Page-Wootters (PW) formula and describes decoherence as an interacting non-equilibrium process. It leads to the reduction of the Hilbert space and the emergence of an intrinsic non-unitary process as well as Born's rule. These outcomes are achieved without relying on the assumptions of einselection and pointer basis.</description>

      <title>Independent-oscillator model and the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a brief and quick introduction to the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator, while focusing on the steady-state thermodynamic aspects. A derivation of the quantum Langevin equation is carefully outlined based on the microscopic model of the heat bath as a collection of a large number of independent quantum oscillators, the so-called independent-oscillator model. This is followed by a discussion on the relevant `weak-coupling' limit. In the steady state, we analyze the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem which has generated a considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy, specific heat, and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for one-dimensional quantum Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of dissipative diamagnetism in the context of quantum Brownian oscillators, emphasizing upon the role of confining potentials and also upon the environment-induced classical-quantum crossover. We discuss situations where the system-bath coupling is via the momentum variables by focusing on a gauge-invariant model of momentum-momentum coupling in the presence of a vector potential; for this problem, we derive the quantum Langevin equation and discuss quantum thermodynamic functions. Finally, the topic of fluctuation theorems is discussed (albeit, briefly) in the context of classical and quantum cyclotron motion of a particle coupled to a heat bath.</description>

Abstract: A boson sampler implements a restricted model of quantum computing. It is defined by the ability to sample from the distribution resulting from the interference of identical bosons propagating according to programmable, non-interacting dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a new combination of tools for implementing boson sampling using ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional, tunnel-coupled optical lattice. These tools include fast and programmable preparation of large ensembles of nearly identical bosonic atoms ($99.5^{+0.5}_{-1.6}\;\%$ indistinguishability) by means of rearrangement with optical tweezers and high-fidelity optical cooling, propagation for variable evolution time in the lattice with low loss ($5.0(2)\;\%$, independent of evolution time), and high fidelity detection of the atom positions after their evolution (typically $99.8(1)\;\%$). With this system, we study specific instances of boson sampling involving up to $180$ atoms distributed among $\sim 1000$ sites in the lattice. Direct verification of a given boson sampling distribution is not feasible in this regime. Instead, we introduce and perform targeted tests to determine the indistinguishability of the prepared atoms, to characterize the applied family of single particle unitaries, and to observe expected bunching features due to interference for a large range of atom numbers. When extended to interacting systems, our work demonstrates the core capabilities required to directly assemble ground and excited states in simulations of various Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Surface induced odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity as a veritable signature of Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states (MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper (SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a $p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction three distinct phases emerge: the topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the trivial phase devoid of MBS. Surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is induced only in the topological regime when MBS appears. In contrast, surface-induced even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the existence of MBS. Importantly, we find the surface induced odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is immune to disorder in the topological phase featuring MBS, while in the trivial phase the surface induced even-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is affected by disorder. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Universal dynamics of the entropy of work distribution in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

Abstract: Driving a quantum many-body system across the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the finite time has been concerned in different branches of physics to explore various fundamental questions. Here, we analyze how the underlying QPT affects the work distribution $P(W)$, when the control parameter of a ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates is tuned through the critical point in the finite time. We show that the work distribution undergoes a dramatic change with increasing the driving time $\tau$. To capture the characteristics of the work distribution, we analyze the entropy of $P(W)$ and find three different regions in the evolution of entropy as a function of $\tau$. Specifically, the entropy is insensitive to the driving time in the region of very short $\tau$, while it exhibits a universal power-law decay in the region with intermediate value of $\tau$. In particular, the power-law scaling of the entropy is according with the well-known Kibble-Zurek mechanism. For the region with large $\tau$, the validity of the adiabatic perturbation theory leads to the entropy decay as $\tau^{-2}\ln\tau$. Our results verify the usefulness of the entropy of the work distribution for understanding the critical dynamics and provide an alternative way to experimentally study nonequilibrium properties in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Gravity-mediated decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A small quantum system within the gravitational field of a massive body will be entangled with the quantum degrees of freedom of the latter. Hence, the massive body acts as an environment, and it induces non-unitary dynamics, noise, and decoherence to the quantum system. It is impossible to shield systems on Earth from this gravity-mediated decoherence, which could severely affect all experiments with macroscopic quantum systems. We undertake a first-principles analysis of this effect, by deriving the corresponding open system dynamics. We find that near-future quantum experiments are not affected, but there is a strong decoherence effect at the human scale. The decoherence time for a superposition of two localized states of a human with an one meter separation is of the order of one second.</description>

      <title>Mechanical detection of nuclear decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of individual nuclear $\alpha$ decays through the mechanical recoil of the entire micron-sized particle in which the decaying nuclei are embedded. Momentum conservation ensures that such measurements are sensitive to any particles emitted in the decay, including neutral particles that may otherwise evade detection with existing techniques. Detection of the minuscule recoil of an object more than $10^{12}$ times more massive than the emitted particles is made possible by recently developed techniques in levitated optomechanics, which enable high-precision optical control and measurement of the mechanical motion of optically trapped particles. Observation of a change in the net charge of the particle coincident with the recoil allows decays to be identified with background levels at the micro-Becquerel level. The techniques developed here may find use in fields ranging from nuclear forensics to dark matter and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Ring Structure in the Complex Plane: A Fingerprint of non-Hermitian Mobility Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By Avila's global theory, we analytically reveal that the non-Hermitian mobility edge will take on a ring structure in the complex plane, which we name as "mobility ring". The universality of mobility ring has been checked and supported by the Hermitian limit, $PT$-symmetry protection and without $PT$-symmetry cases. Further, we study the evolution of mobility ring versus quasiperiodic strength, and find that in the non-Hermitian system, there will appear multiple mobility ring structures. With cross-reference to the multiple mobility edges in Hermitian case, we give the expression of the maximum number of mobility rings. Finally, by comparing the results of Avila's global theorem and self-duality method, we show that self-duality relation has its own limitations in calculating the critical point in non-Hermitian systems. As we know, the general non-Hermitian system has a complex spectrum, which determines that the non-Hermitian mobility edge can but exhibit a ring structure in the complex plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) in the Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model, where the Stark field of strength $\varepsilon$ is added onto the one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice. We perform scaling analysis and numerical calculations of the localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited states to characterize critical properties of the delocalization-localization transition. Remarkably, our scaling analysis shows that, near the critical point, the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\varepsilon$ as $\xi\propto\varepsilon^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ a new critical exponent for the AAS model, which is different from the counterparts for both the pure Aubry-Andre (AA) model and Stark model. The IPR $\mathcal{I}$ scales as $\mathcal{I}\propto\varepsilon^{s}$ with the critical exponent $s\approx0.098$, which is also different from both two pure models. The energy gap $\Delta E$ scales as $\Delta E\propto \varepsilon^{\nu z}$ with the same critical exponent $z\approx2.374$ as that for the pure AA model. We further reveal hybrid scaling functions in the overlap between the critical regions of the Anderson and Stark localizations. Moreover, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization transitions in the AAS model. By linearly changing the Stark (quasiperiodic) potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length and the IPR, and study their dependence on the driving rate. We find that the driven dynamics from the ground state is well described by the KZS with the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. When both the Stark and quasiperiodic potentials are relevant, the KZS form includes the two scaling variables. This work extends our understanding of critical phenomena on localization transitions and generalizes the application of the KZS to hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>
