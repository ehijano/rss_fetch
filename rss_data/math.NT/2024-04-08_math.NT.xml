      <title>Locally algebraic representations and integral structures on the cohomology of arithmetic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of locally algebraic representations and corresponding sheaves in the context of the cohomology of arithmetic groups. These representations are particularly relevant for studying integral structures and special values of cohomological automorphic representations, as well as corresponding period relations. We introduce and investigate related concepts such as locally algebraic $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules and cohomological types of automorphic representations. Applying the recently developed theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules, we establish the existence of canonical global $1/N$-integral structures on spaces of automorphic cusp forms. As an application, we define canonical periods attached to regular algebraic automorphic representations, potentially related to the action of Venkatesh's derived Hecke algebra on cuspidal cohomology.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the Mordell-Weil group of rational points on a certain family of elliptic curves give rise to solutions to a conjecture of Erd\"{o}s on $3$-powerful numbers, and state a related conjecture which can be viewed as an elliptic curve analogue of the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Galois groups for cubic polynomials with colliding critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, and let $f\in K(z)$ be a rational function of degree $d\geq 2$. The Galois group of the field extension generated by the preimages of $x_0\in K$ under all iterates of $f$ naturally embeds in the automorphism group of an infinite $d$-ary rooted tree. In some cases the Galois group can be the full automorphism group of the tree, but in other cases it is known to have infinite index. In this paper, we consider a previously unstudied such case: that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d=3$, and the two finite critical points of $f$ collide at the $\ell$-th iteration, for some $\ell\geq 2$. We describe an explicit subgroup $Q_{\ell,\infty}$ of automorphisms of the $3$-ary tree in which the resulting Galois group must always embed, and we present sufficient conditions for this embedding to be an isomorphism.</description>

Abstract: We study localized versions of the spectral action of Fargues--Scholze, using methods from higher algebra. As our main motivation and application, we deduce a formula for the cohomology of moduli spaces of local shtukas under certain genericity assumptions, and discuss its relation with the Kottwitz conjecture.</description>

      <title>Some conjectures around magnetic modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of meromorphic modular forms characterised by Fourier coefficients that satisfy certain divisibility properties. We present new candidates for these so-called magnetic modular forms, and we conjecture properties that these functions should obey. In particular, we conjecture that magnetic modular forms are closed under the standard operators acting on spaces of modular forms (SL$_2(\mathbb{Z})$ action, Hecke and Atkin-Lehner operators), and that they are characterised by algebraic residues and vanishing period polynomials. We use our conjectures to construct examples of real-analytic modular forms with poles.</description>

      <title>Large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new large sieve inequalities for the Fourier coefficients $\rho_{j\mathfrak{a}}(n)$ of exceptional Maass forms of a given level, weighted by sequences $(a_n)$ with sparse Fourier transforms - including two key types of sequences that arise in the dispersion method. These give the first savings in the exceptional spectrum for the critical case of sequences as long as the level, and lead to improved bounds for various multilinear forms of Kloosterman sums.
  We give three applications and suggest other likely consequences. We show that both primes and smooth numbers are equidistributed in arithmetic progressions to moduli up to $x^{5/8 - o(1)}$, using triply-well-factorable weights for the primes; this completely eliminates the dependency on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture in previous results of Lichtman and the author. Separately, we show that the greatest prime factor of $n^2+1$ is infinitely often greater than $n^{1.3}$, improving Merikoski's $n^{1.279}$.</description>

      <title>An introduction to mixed Tate motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Tate motives are central objects in the study of cohomology groups of algebraic varieties and their arithmetic invariants. They also play a crucial role in a wide variety of questions related to multiple zeta values and polylogarithms, algebraic K-theory, hyperbolic geometry, and particle physics among others. This survey article is an introduction to mixed Tate motives and their many facets. It was written for the proceedings of the Summer School on Motives and Arithmetic Groups held in Strasbourg in June 2022.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the conjectures of Capparelli, Meurman, Primc and Primc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a sequence of two papers, S. Capparelli, A. Meurman, A. Primc, M. Primc (CMPP) and then M. Primc put forth three remarkable sets of conjectures, stating that the generating functions of coloured integer partition in which the parts satisfy restrictions on the multiplicities admit simple infinite product forms. While CMPP related one set of conjectures to the principally specialised characters of standard modules for the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, finding a Lie-algebraic interpretation for the remaining two sets remained an open problem. In this paper, we use the work of Griffin, Ono and the fourth author on Rogers-Ramanujan identities for affine Lie algebras to solve this problem, relating the remaining two sets of conjectures to non-standard specialisations of standard modules for $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+1}^{(2)}$. We also use their work to formulate conjectures for the bivariate generating function of one-parameter families of CMPP partitions in terms of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. We make a detailed study of several further aspects of CMPP partitions, obtaining (i) functional equations for bivariate generating functions which generalise the well-known Rogers-Selberg equations, (ii) a partial level-rank duality in the $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ case, and (iii) (conjectural) identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type for $\mathrm{D}_3^{(2)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let F be a local field. In the case of F being the real field, Pierre Cartier constructed Heisenberg-Weil representations of a Heisenberg group in families using non-self-dual lattices. This result was later reformulated by Jae-Hyun Yang in another paper. We extend this family of representations to a representation of a Jacobi subgroup by incorporating a rational Metaplectic group. In the case of F being a non-archimedean local field of odd residual characteristic or a finite unramified extension of the field of 2-adic numbers, we obtain similar results for a Jacobi group by incorporating a Metaplectic group.</description>

      <title>Even-carry polynomials and cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cohomology groups of line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on the \emph{incidence correspondence}, that is, a general hypersurface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ of degrees $(1,1)$. Whereas the characteristic $0$ situation is completely understood, the cohomology in characteristic $p$ depends in a mysterious way on the base-$p$ digits of the degrees $(d, e)$ of $\mathcal{L}$. Gao and Raicu (following Linyuan Liu) prove a recursive description of the cohomology for $n = 3$, which relates to Nim polynomials when $p = 2$. In this paper, we devise a suitable generalization of Nim polynomials, which we call \emph{even-carry polynomials,} by which we can solve the recurrence of Liu--Gao--Raicu to yield an explicit formula for the cohomology for $n = 3$ and general $p$. We also make some conjectures on the general form of the cohomology for general $n$ and $p$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gross-Prasad conjecture and its refinement for the Bessel periods in the case of $\left(\mathrm{SO}\left(5\right),\mathrm{SO}\left(2\right)\right)$. In particular, by combining several theta correspondences, we prove the Ichino-Ikeda type formula for any tempered irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations. As a corollary of our formula, we prove an explicit formula relating certain weighted averages of Fourier coefficients of holomorphic Siegel cusp forms of degree two which are Hecke eigenforms to central special values of $L$-functions. The formula is regarded as a natural generalization of the B\"ocherer conjecture to the non-trivial toroidal character case.</description>

Abstract: We unfold the theta integrals defining the Kudla-Millson lift of genus 1 associated to even lattices of signature (b,2), where b&gt;2. This enables us to compute the Fourier expansion of such defining integrals and prove the injectivity of the Kudla-Millson lift. Although the latter result has been already proved by Bruinier, our new procedure has the advantage of paving the ground for a strategy to prove the injectivity of the lift also for the cases of general signature and of genus greater than 1.</description>

Abstract: Current methods for the classification of number fields with small regulator depend mainly on an upper bound for the discriminant, which can be improved by looking for the best possible upper bound of a specific polynomial function over an hypercube. In this paper, we provide new and effective upper bounds for the case of fields with one complex embedding and degree between five and nine: this is done by adapting the strategy we have adopted to study the totally real case, but for this new setting several new computational issues had to be overcome. As a consequence, we detect the four number fields of signature (6,1) with smallest regulator; we also expand current lists of number fields with small regulator in signatures (3,1), (4,1) and (5,1).</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective variety over a number field $K$ endowed with a height function associated to an ample line bundle on $X$. Given an algebraic extension $F$ of $K$ with a sufficiently big Northcott number, we can show that there are finitely many cycles in $X_{\bar{\mathbb{Q}}}$ of bounded degree defined over $F$. Fields $F$ with the required properties were explicitly constructed in arXiv:2107.09027 and arXiv:2204.04446, motivating our investigation. We point out explicit specializations to canonical heights associated to abelian varieties and selfmaps of $\mathbb{P}^n$. We apply similar methods to the study of CM-points. As a crucial tool, we introduce a refinement of Northcott's theorem.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Bigraphs</title>

Abstract: In their seminal paper, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak (LPS) defined the notion of regular Ramanujan graphs and gave an explicit construction of infinite families of $(p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley graphs, for infinitely many $p$. In this paper we extend the work of LPS and its successors to bigraphs (biregular bipartite graphs), in several aspects: we investigate the combinatorial properties of various generalizations of the notion of Ramanujan graphs, define a notion of Cayley bigraphs, and give explicit constructions of infinite families of $(p^3+1,p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs, for infinitely many $p$.
  Both the LPS graphs and our ones are arithmetic, arising as quotients of Bruhat-Tits trees by congruence subgroups of arithmetic lattices in a $p$-adic group, $PGL_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for LPS and $PU_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for us. In both cases the Ramanujan property relates to the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture (GRC), on the respective groups. But while for $PGL_2$ the GRC holds unconditionally, this is not so in the case of $PU_3$. We find explicit cases where the GRC does and does not hold, and use this to construct arithmetic non-Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs as well, and prove that nevertheless they satisfy the Sarnak-Xue density hypothesis.
  On the combinatorial side, we present a pseudorandomness characterization of Ramanujan bigraphs, and a more general notion of biexpanders. We also show that the graphs we construct exhibit the cutoff phenomenon with bounded window size for the mixing time of non-backtracking random walks, either as a consequence of the Ramanujan property, or the density hypothesis. Finally, we present some other applications of our work: super golden gates for $PU_3$, Ramanujan and non-Ramanujan complexes of type $\tilde{A}_2$, optimal strong approximation for $p$-arithmetic subgroups of $PSU_3$ and vanishing of Betti numbers of Picard modular surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.11966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diaconis and Gamburd computed moments of secular coefficients in the CUE ensemble. We use the characteristic map to give a new combinatorial proof of their result. We also extend their computation to moments of traces of symmetric powers, where the same result holds but in a wider range.
  Our combinatorial proof is inspired by gcd matrices, as used by Vaughan and Wooley and by Granville and Soundararajan. We use these CUE computations to suggest a conjecture about moments of characters sums twisted by the Liouville (or by the M\"obius) function, and establish a version of it in function fields.
  The moral of our conjecture (and its verification in function fields) is that the Steinhaus random multiplicative function is a good model for the Liouville (or for the M\"obius) function twisted by a random Dirichlet character.
  We also evaluate moments of secular coefficients and traces of symmetric powers, without any condition on the size of the matrix. As an application we give a new formula for a matrix integral that was considered by Keating, Rodgers, Roditty-Gershon and Rudnick in their study of the $k$-fold divisor function.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of local Arthur packets for classical groups and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups, we develop an account of theory on the intersection problem of local Arthur packets. Specifically, following Atobe's reformulation on M{\oe}glin's construction of local Arthur packets, we give a complete set of operators on the construction data, based on which, we provide algorithms and Sage codes to determine whether a given representation is of Arthur type. Furthermore, for any representation $\pi$ of Arthur type, we give a precise formula for the set $$ \Psi(\pi)=\{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local Arthur packet } \Pi_{\psi} \text{ contains } \pi\}.$$
  Our results have many applications, including the precise counting of tempered representations in any local Arthur packet, specifying and characterizing "the" local Arthur parameter in $\Psi(\pi)$ for $\pi$, especially when $\pi$ belongs to several local Arthur packets but does not belong to any local $L$-packet of Arthur type.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the closure ordering conjecture on the local $L$-parameters of representations in local Arthur packets of $\mathrm{G}_n=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}, \mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}$ over a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero. Precisely, given any representation $\pi$ in a local Arthur packet $\Pi_{\psi}$, the closure of the local $L$-parameter of $\pi$ in the Vogan variety must contain the local $L$-parameter corresponding to $\psi$. This conjecture reveals a geometric nature of local Arthur packets and is inspired by the work of Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan, and the work of Cunningham, Fiori, Moussaoui, Mracek, and Xu, on ABV-packets. As an application, for general quasi-split connected reductive groups, we show that the closure ordering conjecture implies the enhanced Shahidi conjecture, under certain reasonable assumptions. This provides a framework towards the enhanced Shahidi conjecture in general. We verify these assumptions for $\mathrm{G}_n$, hence give a new proof of the enhanced Shahidi conjecture. At last, we show that local Arthur packets cannot be fully contained in other ones, which is in contrast to the situation over Archimedean local fields and has its own interests.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition Method for Poisson--Boltzmann Equations based on Solvent Excluded Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a domain decomposition method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a solvent-excluded surface widely used in computational chemistry. The model relies on a nonlinear equation defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a space-dependent dielectric permittivity and an ion-exclusion function that accounts for steric effects. Potential theory arguments transform the nonlinear equation into two coupled equations defined in a bounded domain. Then, the Schwarz decomposition method is used to formulate local problems by decomposing the cavity into overlapping balls and only solving a set of coupled sub-equations in each ball. The main novelty of the proposed method is the introduction of a hybrid linear-nonlinear solver used to solve the equation. A series of numerical experiments are presented to test the method and show the importance of the nonlinear model.</description>

      <title>On the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations of p-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the upper bound of wavefront sets of irreducible admissible representations of connected reductive groups defined over non-Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero. We formulate a new conjecture on the upper bound and show that it can be reduced to that of anti-discrete series representations, namely, those whose Aubert-Zelevinsky duals are discrete series. Then, we show that this conjecture is equivalent to the Jiang conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local Arthur packets and also equivalent to an analogous conjecture on the upper bound of wavefront sets of representations in local ABV packets.</description>
