      <title>Higher-order topological superconductivity in type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetals with a hybrid pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the self-consistent method on a two-orbital type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetal, revealing a hybrid pairing of singlet $s$-wave and triplet $p$-wave. We present a detailed analysis of the normal-state electronic structure and the self-consistent results. Our findings indicate that the selection of hybrid pairings is governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: specifically, $s$-wave pairing dominates on the bottom surface, while $p$-wave pairing prevails on the top. Furthermore, the emergent superconducting state is a second-order topological superconductors with hinge states in the system. Our results identify type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Stability, electronic disruption, and anisotropic superconductivity of hydrogenated trilayer metal tetraborides (MB$_{4}$H; M=Be, Mg, Ca, Al)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in MgB$_2$ (\(T_c = 39\) K) \cite{nagamatsu2001superconductivity} established metal diborides (MB$_2$) as a promising class of conventional superconductors. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the synthesis of 2D MgB$_2$ with a \(T_c\) of 36 K \cite{cheng2018fabrication}, reigniting interest in layered metal borides. This has led to predictions of superconductivity in various 2D metal borides, including MB$_4$ (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al), with CaB$_4$ exhibiting the highest estimated \(T_c\) of 36.1 K. To explore the impact of hydrogenation on superconductivity, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hydrogenated trilayer metal borides (MB$_4$H; M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al). Our results reveal that these materials retain a metallic nature dominated by boron \(p\)-orbitals, while hydrogenation significantly alters their band dispersion and Fermi surface topology. Phonon calculations confirm their dynamical stability and reveal strong electron-phonon interactions, leading to multi-gap superconductivity. Among the studied compounds, MgB$_4$H, AlB$_4$H, and CaB$_4$H exhibit possible two superconducting gaps, with CaB$_4$H showing the strongest electron-phonon coupling, resulting in an intrinsic superconducting transition temperature of 64 K. In contrast, AlB$_4$H shows the weakest coupling, with \(T_c = 22\) K. The calculated electron-phonon coupling constants (\(\lambda\)) range from 0.62 to 0.99, demonstrating the tunability of superconducting properties through elemental substitution. These findings provide valuable insights into superconductivity in hydrogenated metal borides and highlight their potential for high-\(T_c\) applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles evidence for conventional superconductivity in a quasicrystal approximant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.</description>

      <title>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electron Correlations on Infinite-Layer Cuprates and Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of unconventional superconductivity involves a balance of interaction strengths. Precise determination of correlation strength across different material families is therefore important. Here, we present a combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ that enables fair comparison of their interaction strengths. For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Modern Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation, Superfluidity, and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Photothermal resistivity alignment of optical fibers to SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a straightforward optoelectronic fiber alignment technique for super- conducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that exploits the temperature- dependent resistance of the nanowire under optical absorption. The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is moni- tored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorp- tion and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber- SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.</description>

      <title>The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Fraunhofer-like magnetic diffraction patterns confirm the presence of Josephson effect in all but one of our devices. A magnetic field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in the right-handed/left-handed devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $I_{c-}$, with a maximum asymmetry of 5\%. The intrinsic superconducting diode effect is not observed in the right-handed/right-handed devices. We provide an explanation for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed devices.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum pairing and superlattice superconductivity in valley-imbalanced rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a `valley-independent Chern number', measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</description>
