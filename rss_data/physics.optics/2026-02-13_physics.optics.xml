      <title>Single-exposure holographic lithography of ultra-high aspect-ratio microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric lithography offers a path to scalable fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanoscale architectures, yet existing approaches are limited by quasi-two-dimensional exposure physics or slow serial writing. We present a single-exposure volumetric fabrication strategy that enables creation of ultrahigh-aspect-ratio 3D structures with 6 um minimum features. An inverse-designed volumetric (holographic) phase mask generates an extended-depth-of-field intensity distribution inside a photoresist volume while preserving high transverse resolution, enabling uniform polymerization of the full volume in a single exposure. With exposure times of approximately 20 s, we fabricate lattices, Penrose tilings, and micromechanical elements with feature sizes down to 6 um over volumes up to 800 x 800 x 720 um^3, achieving aspect ratios exceeding 120:1. Quantitative analysis of capillary flow in hollow lattices demonstrates controlled fluid transport with an effective capillary transport coefficient of 176.3 um/(ms)^(1/2). In situ nanoindentation-based micro-compression reveals that the printed 3D hexagonal close-packed lattices exhibit a well-defined linear elastic regime with an effective Young's modulus of 5.7 GPa, followed by progressive buckling and densification characteristic of mechanically robust cellular architectures. Overlapping, tilted and multi-mask exposures further enable quasi-3D complex geometries with potential for reconfigurability. This approach establishes a new regime of high-throughput volumetric fabrication.</description>

      <title>Switchable high-Q light absorbers based on phase-change resonant metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a switchable high-Q light absorber based on a reconfigurable metasurface enabled by a lowloss phase-change material (PCM). By leveraging the coupling between guided-mode resonance and Fabry-Perot modes, mediated by the phase-transition dynamics of the embedded PCM, the resonance Q factor can be actively tuned. This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor. Consequently, the metasurface exhibits perfect absorption in the amorphous state and a reflection-dominated response in the crystalline state. The proposed metasurface holds significant potential for diverse nanophotonic applications, including photodetection and thermal emission control.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dispersion Accumulation in Fiber Loops for Realizing Record-High Frequency Resolution or Ultra-Low Signal Sampling Rate in Dispersion-Based Photonics-Assisted Wideband Microwave Measurement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion-based photonics-assisted microwave measurement systems provide immense potential for real-time analysis of wideband and dynamic signals. However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy, Octave-Spanning Supercontinuum Generation in Ta_2O_5 Waveguides: Towards Optical Coherence Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercontinuum generation (SCG) on integrated photonic platforms is a pivotal technology for developing next-generation chip-scale systems for precision spectroscopy and metrology. While significant progress has been made with silicon (Si) and silicon nitride ($Si_3N_4$) platforms, they are often constrained by two-photon absorption (TPA) or moderate nonlinear coefficients, necessitating a trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. Tantalum pentoxide ($Ta_2O_5$), possessing both high nonlinearity and a wide bandgap, emerges as a promising candidate; however, current implementations remain challenged by high pump energy consumption. Here, we report a low-loss $Ta_2O_5$ integrated waveguide fabricated via the Damascene process. It enables the generation of a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a low pulse energy of only 92.9 pJ (60 fs, 1550 nm). Notably, the corresponding peak power is a mere 1.36 kW, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art comparable broadband sources. Furthermore, at the maximum pump energy, our spectrum exhibits an ultrabroad coverage from 450 nm to 3400 nm, spanning nearly three octaves. Supported by numerical simulations, we analyze the dynamics of soliton fission. Furthermore, a Michelson interferometry system developed using this source exhibits superior performance, achieving not only micrometer-scale axial resolution but also a 6 dB sensitivity roll-off length of 3.1 mm. This exceptional roll-off performance, combined with a displacement measurement sensitivity of 346 nm, underscores the immense potential of the $Ta_2O_5$ platform for applications in biomedical imaging and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Hybridized-band parametric oscillations in coupled Kerr microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled resonators form band-like optical states that support rich nonlinearities beyond what is possible in single resonators. In these systems, four-wave mixing mediates interband coupling, displaying multimode dynamics that span both spatial and spectral degrees of freedom. In this study, we propose a framework describing the onset and control of hybridized optical parametric oscillation in three coupled silicon nitride microring resonators. In a symmetric configuration, we observe the emergence of diverse phase-matching pathways defined by the dispersive band structure. We develop an analytical model that captures the parametric gain of these interband processes and derive closed-form expressions for the dominant gain maxima; the analytical framework itself readily extends to more complex coupled networks. We further report an asymmetric design that co-engineers mode overlap and dispersion to operate on a compact 7-GHz spacing, free from mode competition. Our findings establish design principles for engineering nonlinear dynamics in coupled-resonator platforms, with implications for coherent photonic computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Broadband Tunable Photon-Pair Generation and Spectrum Measurement Based on Noncritical Lithium Niobate Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon pairs play a vital role in modern science, driving extensive research into their generation. Yet, the narrow phase-matching bandwidth of conventional crystals has largely confined studies to specific wavelengths, leaving research on broadband tunable sources underexplored. Here, we employ a non-critical phase-matched lithium niobate (LN) crystal to generate widely tunable photon pairs. The generated near-infrared (NIR) photon pairs exhibit a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR &gt; 20 dB) and are tunable across the 800-1600 nm range. We further showcase the utility of NIR photon pairs in spectroscopy by detecting carbon monoxide (CO) gas absorption. This approach will facilitate the design of advanced LN-based photonic experiments.</description>

      <title>Conditions for resonant optical tunnelling in three-layer photonic microsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on optical tunneling across thin three-layer planar structures embedded in a thick and transparent dielectric medium. First, compact transmittance expressions for different configurations are obtained using a generalized Fresnel coefficient method. These expressions are subsequently used to analyze various tunnelling outcomes. We show that two types of tunneling effects can be distinguished, depending on the kind of waves that are present in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate in this layer, the transmittance formula and the phase condition for resonant tunneling are identical to that obtained in a Fabry-Perot etalon. However, in the case of evanescent or damped waves in the core layer, the new expression for transmittance provides another resonant condition related, this time, to the wave amplitude. For clarity, transparent materials are addressed first (including ideal metals), and the implications of absorption are studied later. Different angular-spectral maps are displayed to exemplify the main features of the tunneling effect in each analyzed configuration. To highlight, it is shown that tunnelling can occur in photonic systems with thicknesses up to several wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Topology-Enabled Switchable Unidirectional Radiative Band in a Bilayer Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling how an open photonic system exchanges energy with its environment-and in particular how it radiates into the far field-is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian wave physics and a key enabler for directional photonic functionalities. Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes.</description>

      <title>Variable dose slicer for refractive index engineering in two-photon polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-photon polymerization (TPP), the degree of conversion (DC) of the resin has an effect on a broad range of material properties like refractive index (RI) or stiffness. Heterogeneous DC can substitute material doping and multimaterial structures, and outright enable structure designs not possible otherwise. However, obtaining variable DC in the polymer, typically achieved by implementing a variable exposure dose, is held back due to the lack of software support for fabrication and measurement techniques for validation, adding up to a high barrier of entry.
  This work presents two major breakthroughs in (3+1)D TPP: design freedom and variable-DC fabrication, that are provided by an open-source slicer, as well as calibration methodology for determination of the RI for any DC. Application examples include grayscale lithography, control over writing direction and trajectories, as well as bio-mimicking microphantoms with carefully engineered 3D RI. Results of the RI calibration demonstrate excellent repeatability, accuracy and stability of variable-DC structures. Supported by in-depth metrological analysis, the goal is to popularize variable DC printing within TPP community and to get more out of the existing TPP systems and workflows. In summary, this work provides a complete toolbox for 3D RI engineering and sets the stage for new inventions enabled by point-wise dose control.</description>

      <title>Coherent Perfect Tunneling at Exceptional Points via Directional Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent perfect tunneling in the presence of loss and asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge in wave transport, a universal problem across optics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical description of a photonic topological insulator based on a cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a theoretical description of a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator in the form of a simple cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators that is based on a dyadic Green's function approach. By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm \pi/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($\chi^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $\chi^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$\chi^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.</description>

      <title>Bosonic statistics enhance Maxwell's demon in photonic experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maxwell's demon elucidates the value of information in thermodynamics, using measurement and feedback: he evolves an equilibrated gas into a nonequilibrium state, from which one might extract work. The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonics provides a powerful approach for developing compact, stable and scalable architectures for the generation, manipulation and detection of quantum states of light. To this end, several material platforms are being developed in parallel, each providing its specific assets, and hybridization techniques to combine their strengths are now possible. This review focuses on AlGaAs, a III-V semiconductor platform combining a mature fabrication technology, direct band-gap compliant with electrical injection, low-loss operation, large electro-optic effect, and compatibility with superconducting detectors for on-chip detection. We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.</description>

      <title>Optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is limited by biexciton absorption, not biexciton recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite three decades of experimental study, optical gain in colloidal quantum dots still lacks a microscopic theory capable of explaining gain thresholds approaching one exciton per dot, their size dependence, or the anomalously small effective stimulated-emission cross sections observed across materials. Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing. The theory unifies disparate materials by quantitatively explaining all longstanding gain phenomenology in CdSe quantum dots and predicts a continuous crossover to effective four-level, near-thresholdless gain in dynamically disordered lattices such as perovskite quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Unconditional full vector magnetometry using spin selectivity in Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.</description>

      <title>Theory of the two-photon Franz-Keldysh effect and electric-field-induced bichromatic coherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of a constant electric field on two-photon absorption in a semiconductor is calculated using an independent-particle theory. The theoretical framework is an extension of a theory of the one-photon Franz-Keldysh effect [Wahlstrand and Sipe, Phys. Rev. B 82, 075206 (2010)]. The theory includes the effect of the constant field, including field-induced coupling between closely spaced bands, in the electronic wavefunctions and calculates optical absorption perturbatively. Numerical calculations are performed using a 14-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot\mathbf{p}$ band structure model for GaAs. For all nonzero tensor elements, field-enabled two-photon absorption (TPA) below the band gap and Franz-Keldysh oscillations in the TPA spectrum are predicted, with a generally larger effect in tensor elements with more components parallel to the constant electric field direction. Some tensor elements that are zero in the absence of a field become nonzero in the presence of the constant electric field and depend on its sign. Notably, these elements are linear in the electric field to lowest order and may be substantial away from band structure critical points at room temperature and/or with a non-uniform field. Electric-field-induced changes in the carrier injection rate due to interference between one- and two-photon absorption are also calculated. The electric field enables this bichromatic coherent control process for polarization configurations where it is normally forbidden, and also modifies the spectrum of the process for configurations where it is allowed by crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Designing lensless imaging systems to maximize information capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mask-based lensless imaging uses an optical encoder (e.g. a phase or amplitude mask) to capture measurements, then a computational decoding algorithm to reconstruct images. In this work, we evaluate and design lensless encoders based on the information content of their measurements using mutual information estimation. Our approach formalizes the object-dependent nature of lensless imaging and quantifies the interdependence between object sparsity, encoder multiplexing, and noise. Our analysis reveals that optimal encoder designs should tailor encoder multiplexing to object sparsity for maximum information capture, and that all optimally-encoded measurements share the same level of sparsity. Using mutual information-based optimization, we design information-optimal encoders for compressive imaging of fixed object distributions. Our designs demonstrate improved downstream reconstruction performance for objects in the distribution, without requiring joint optimization with a specific reconstruction algorithm. We validate our approach experimentally by evaluating lensless imaging systems directly from captured measurements, without the need for image formation models, reconstruction algorithms, or ground truth data. Our comprehensive analysis establishes design and engineering principles for lensless imaging systems, and offers a model for the study of general multiplexing systems, especially those with object-dependent performance.</description>

      <title>Reducing Disorder-Induced Backscattering in Photonic Crystal Waveguides through Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) allow for the engineering of photonic modes and band structures to control the flow of light and light-matter interactions within the waveguide. They have shown potential for enhancing optical nonlinearities, quantum dot single photon emissions, as well as optical buffers due to their ability to confine fields on-chip and produce slow-light modes. While these features are promising for applications in nanophotonics, PCWs are prone to high scattering losses due to disorder-induced backscattering, which has remained a significant problem for decades, across various waveguide designs. By combining a fast mode solving approach with physics-based scattering formulas and inverse design, we show how backscattering losses can be significantly reduced, even when working at the same group index. We demonstrate substantial improvements for both W1-like waveguide modes as well topological waveguide modes. Our general methodology is fully three dimensional and can be used to introduce new PCWs for a variety of design metrics.</description>

      <title>A Concept of Two-Point Propagation Field of a Single Photon: A Way to Picometer X-ray Displacement Sensing and Nanometer Resolution 3D X-ray Micro-Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Electroluminescence from Dirac Landau Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report Dirac Landau polaritons observed by terahertz (THz) magnetoreflectivity spectroscopy, demonstrating strong coupling between cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells and optical cavity modes. Under pulsed electrical injection we observe efficient nonlinear electroluminescence, with a strongly out-of-equilibrium polariton distribution dominated by emission from the upper polariton branches. Model analysis of the bias-dependent emission intensity and spectral narrowing indicates a polariton occupancy per mode approaching unity, with a possible contribution from stimulated polariton emission in the spectral region of the upper anticrossing. These results open prospects toward Dirac Landau polariton condensates and low-threshold, tunable THz polariton lasers based on cyclotron emission.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. Our framework unifies examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot resonances in high-contrast resonator systems and study the properties of their associated resonant modes from continuous differential models. We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation.</description>
