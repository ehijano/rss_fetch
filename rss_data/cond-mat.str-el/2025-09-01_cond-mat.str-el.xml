      <title>Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave induced gapped nodal line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and topological nodal-line states in square-net materials. Our Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases, eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at $\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but finite $\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent explanation for recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Displacement-Field-Driven Transition between Superconductivity and Valley Ferromagnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level. We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral $d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement field $D&lt;D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D&gt;D_c$, a \textit{valley ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections that can falsify our prediction.</description>

      <title>Exact models of chiral flat-band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</description>

      <title>Anyon polarons as a window into the competing phases of the Kitaev-Gamma-Gamma' model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dispersions of anyon quasi-particles in the Kitaev honeycomb spin-liquid perturbed by $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings in order to understand phase transitions into competing states through anyon gap-closing instabilities. We demonstrate how anyon gap closings allow to understand phase transitions into a plethora of previously identified competing phases -- including zigzag, stripy, $120^\circ$, and incommensurate spiral phases -- and are in agreement with numerical studies not only on the nature of the phases, but also on the specific critical values of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings. Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an ferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate spiral, depending on the sign of $\Gamma'$.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Semiclassical Spin Dynamics for Ordered Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Collective Oscillations in Isotropic Spin Systems and their Spectroscopic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves are the fundamental excitations in magnetically ordered spin systems and are ubiquitously observed in magnetic materials. However, the standard understanding of spin waves as collective spin oscillations in an effective harmonic potential does not consider the possibility of soft modes, such as those due to an effective quartic potential. In this work, we show that such quartic potentials arise under very general conditions in a broad class of isotropic spin systems without a fine-tuning of the interaction parameters. Considering models with spin spiral ground states in two and three spatial dimensions, we numerically demonstrate that quartic amplitude spin oscillations produce a fluctuation-induced spin-wave gap which grows with temperature according to a characteristic power-law. In conjunction with a phenomenological theory, the present work provides a general theoretical framework for describing soft spin modes, extending the previously discussed spin dynamics in the presence of order-by-disorder, and highlighting the important role of finite-size effects. Our predictions of a temperature-dependent gap in spiral spin systems could be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments, providing direct spectroscopic evidence for thermal effects arising from soft spin modes in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of dice-lattice flat band at the Fermi level in layered electride YCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at $E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations in magnetized helical edge states coupled to s-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their Lyapunov exponents for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Determination of ground states of one-dimensional quantum systems using the cluster iTEBD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states, we introduce a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm for simulating quantum many-body systems, addressing the computational accuracy challenges in strongly correlated physics. By redefining the wave-function ansatz to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom, we enhance the representation of entanglement, thereby improving the accuracy of the ground states. Utilizing the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized truncation schemes, our method maintains roughly the same computational complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1 anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy, and entanglement entropy, has been demonstrated. This method provides a scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision, making it suitable for situations where a pure increase in bond dimension alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian perspectives for quantum states and application to ab initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum many-electron problem is not just at the heart of condensed matter phenomena, but also essential for first-principles simulation of chemical phenomena. Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data.</description>

      <title>On the Electronic Contribution to Crystalline Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the electronic structure factor as a phase-sensitive contribution to diffraction that directly encodes the properties of the occupied-band wave functions. In the one-dimensional SSH model, $F_{\mathrm{cond}}$ is governed by the relative sublattice phase, which integrates to the Zak phase. This provides a clear diffraction-based criterion to distinguish trivial and topological regimes in the absence of any structural change. Beyond the SSH limit, the same Bloch-based construction naturally accounts for commensurate and incommensurate magnetic satellites in antiferromagnets, reproducing the additional peaks at $q=G\pm Q$ observed in NiO, MnO, chromium, and cuprates. These results demonstrate that diffraction can probe electronic topology and magnetic ordering on equal footing, opening a route to phase-sensitive structural characterization of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between residual resistivity and A coefficient in correlated metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of strong electronic correlations and disorder are crucial for emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and quantum criticality. While both are omnipresent in real materials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To disentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of randomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical substitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase nearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of the disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime $\rho(T)=\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\propto (m^{\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the electronic mass enhancement. Contrary to conventional expectations, we observe that at fixed disorder level $\rho_0$ grows linearly with $A$. This scaling can be understood in terms of chemical-potential fluctuations with variance $\sigma_\mu^2$, yielding $\rho_0 \propto A\,\sigma_\mu^2$. By comparing our findings to transport data on other organic Mott systems, oxides, heavy-fermion compounds, and moir\'e materials, we demonstrate that this new relation between residual resistivity and mass enhancement is a universal feature of correlated metals.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Anyon-Otto thermal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon energy at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Phonon-scattering-induced quantum linear magnetoresistance up to room temperature</title>

Abstract: The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Correlation tuned Fermi-arc topology in a Weyl ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons on Fermi arcs (FAs), a hallmark of Weyl semimetals, exhibit chiral transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Critical photoinduced reflectivity relaxation dynamics in single-layer Bi-based cuprates near the pseudogap end point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of photoinduced transient reflectivity dynamics in heavily overdoped single-layer cuprate (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Pb-Bi2201), across the end points of the pseudogap and superconducting phases, has been conducted using optical ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. In the Pb-Bi2201 just before reaching the pseudogap end point, the transient reflectivity dynamics above $T_{{\rm c}}$ resemble the pseudogap response observed in optimally doped La-Bi2201. At low temperatures, however, the relaxation time exhibits a power-law divergence, $\tau\sim10\hbar/k_{\mathrm{B}}T$, signaling quantum critical behavior at the pseudogap end point doping. A similar power-law increase in relaxation time is also observed in Pb-Bi2201 just beyond the pseudogap doping end point, though it is less pronounced.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulations of Graphene Analogues: Adsorption Energetics Beyond DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Magnetism in Fe-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model, including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the ($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Robust translational invariance in topological bands against lattice potentials and disorders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically show that the continuous magnetic translational invariance within the Hilbert (sub-)space of a single Landau level (LL) can persist even in the presence of a superlattice electrostatic potential modulation, while such invariance is broken in the full real-space Hilbert space. This is due to the interplay of the superlattice constant and the fundamental length scale of the quantum Hall fluids. In particular for the lowest LL (LLL), when the spacing of superlattice is below the magnetic length, continuous magnetic translational symmetry is very robust. For the fractional quantum Hall phases, the continuous translational symmetry is preserved when the superlattice spacing is below the corresponding fundamental lengths which we can now quantitatively define, which is different from the length scale from the quantum metric. Moreover, our analysis implies that the dynamics of the anyonic excitations can be robust against the long wavelength part of the disorder, and we discuss the related experimental ramifications.</description>

      <title>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Elastic Quantum Criticality in Nematics and Altermagnets via the Elasto-Caloric Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between electronic nematic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons is known to significantly alter the universality class of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP). While non-Fermi-liquid behaviour emerges in the absence of lattice coupling, the inclusion of interactions with acoustic phonons results in observables such as heat capacity and single-particle scattering rate exhibiting only subleading non-analytic corrections to dominant Fermi-liquid terms. In this work, we demonstrate that the elastocaloric effect (ECE) -- the adiabatic temperature change under varying strain -- and the thermal expansion deviate from this pattern. Despite lattice coupling weakening the singularity of the ECE, it preserves a dominant non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. By drawing analogies between nematic systems and field-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected for the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic couplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic interactions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory for elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of the ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects. Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's applicability is demonstrated and discussed across relevant physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification of topological phases of matter is a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics, with applications to quantum technology. Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of Adaptive Finite-Depth Local Unitary (AFDLU) circuits which allow global classical communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition, we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and symmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to the quantum double of the group $S_3$ and to several examples that are beyond solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Tambara-Yamagami string-net, and doubled $SU(2)_4$ anyons.</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>
