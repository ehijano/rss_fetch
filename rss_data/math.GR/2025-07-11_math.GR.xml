      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let two smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ be given, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--xdiffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which implies that a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds, provided the regularity lies in $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <title>Expansion of normal subsets of odd-order elements in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $K$ a normal subset consisting of odd-order elements. The rational closure of $K$, denoted $\mathbf D_K$, is the set of elements $x \in G$ with the property that $\langle x \rangle = \langle y \rangle$ for some $y$ in $K$. If $K^2 \subseteq \mathbf D_K$, we prove that $\langle K \rangle$ is soluble.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of the Dehn functions of Bestvina-Brady groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Dehn function of every finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group grows as a linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomial. In fact, we provide explicit criteria on the defining graph to determine the degree of this polynomial. As a consequence, we identify an obstruction that prevents certain Bestvina-Brady groups from admitting a CAT(0) structure.</description>

      <title>Cocompact unfolding trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper will show when a rooted path tree of a finite directed rooted graph has only finitely many orbits under the action of its undirected automorphism group (i.e. when it is cocompact). This will allow us to specify which trees are almost isomorphic to cocompact trees. We will provide an algorithm that will determine this, thus mostly answering question (1) from arXiv:2212.07205.</description>

      <title>Hyper-u-amenablity and Hyperfiniteness of Treeable Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a free group (with $k \ge 2$ or $k = \infty$ generators) on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Martin compactifications of affine buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out an in-depth study of Martin compactifications of affine buildings, from the viewpoint of potential theory and random walks. This work does not use any group action on buildings, although all the results are also stated within the framework of the Bruhat--Tits theory of semisimple groups over non-Archimedean local fields. This choice should allow the use of these building compactifications in intriguing geometric group theory situations, where only lattice actions are available. The resulting compactified spaces use and, at the same time, make it possible to understand geometrically the descriptions of asymptotic behavior of kernels resulting from the non-Archimedean harmonic analysis on affine buildings. Along the paper, we make explicit the most substantial differences with the case of symmetric spaces, namely absence of a group action but existence of precise asymptotics of Green kernels and, of course, no possibility to stand by standard techniques from PDEs.</description>

      <title>Cluster Magnification, Root Capacity, Unique Chains and Base Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is inspired from the work of M Krithika and P Vanchinathan on Cluster Magnification and the work of Alexander Perlis on Cluster Size. We establish the existence of polynomials for given degree and cluster size over number fields which generalises a result of Perlis. We state the Strong cluster magnification problem and establish an equivalent criterion for that. We also discuss the notion of weak cluster magnification and prove some properties. We provide an important example answering a question about Cluster Towers. We introduce the concept of Root capacity and prove some of its properties. We also introduce the concept of unique descending and ascending chains for extensions and establish some properties and explicitly compute some interesting examples. We establish results about all these phenomena under a particular type of base change and discuss some other related results about strong cluster magnification and unique chains. The article concludes with results about ascending index for a field extension which are analogous to results about cluster size.</description>

      <title>Characters of diagonal products and Hilbert-Schmidt stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a quantitative study of Hilbert-Schmidt stability for infinitely presented groups through the novel notion of stability radius growth. We exhibit an uncountable family of Hilbert-Schmidt stable amenable groups with arbitrarily large such growth. In particular, this answers a question of Lubotzky. Our approach is based on the character-theoretic stability criterion of Hadwin and Shulman. We classify the characters of alternating and elementary enrichments as well as diagonal products, including the classical family of B.H. Neumann groups.</description>

      <title>Symmetry groups of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Origami is the art of folding paper into various patterns without cutting or tearing the paper. By viewing the paper as the complex plane, we iteratively compute and record all intersection points to construct mathematical origami sets. Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern that can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3 angles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which such groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and reflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains more than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a wallpaper group. In this case, the classification of the symmetry group is done algorithmically.</description>
