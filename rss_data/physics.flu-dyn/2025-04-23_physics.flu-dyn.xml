      <title>Non-Hermitian wave turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave turbulence describes the long-time statistical behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems composed of weakly interacting waves. Non-Hermitian media ranging from open quantum systems to active materials can sustain wave propagation in so-called $PT$-symmetric states where gain and loss are effectively balanced. Here, we derive the kinetic equations governing wave turbulence in a prototypical non-Hermitian medium: a three-dimensional fluid with odd viscosity. We calculate its exact anisotropic solution, the so-called Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum, and validate the existence of this regime using direct numerical simulations. This non-Hermitian wave turbulence generates a direct cascade that is sustained down to the smallest scales, suppressing the transition to strong turbulence typically observed in rotating fluids and electron magnetohydrodynamics. Beyond odd viscous fluids, this qualitative mechanism applies to any non-linear system of waves where non-Hermitian effects are enhanced at small scales through gradient terms in the dynamical equations, e.g. via odd elastic moduli or other non-reciprocal responses.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Reacting and Non-Reacting Liquid Jets in Supersonic Crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical jet in supersonic crossflow studies have been widely used to study fundamental physics relevant to a variety of applications. While most JISC works have considered gaseous injection, liquid injection is also of practical interest and introduces additional multiscale physics, such as atomization and evaporation, that complicate the flow dynamics. To facilitate further understanding of these complex phenomena, this work presents multiphase simulations of reacting and non-reacting JISC configurations with freestream Mach numbers of roughly 4.5. Adaptive mesh refinement is used with a volume of fluid scheme to capture liquid breakup and turbulent mixing at high resolution. The results compare the effects of the jet momentum ratio and freestream temperature on jet penetration, mixing, and combustion dynamics. For similar jet momentum ratios, the jet penetration and mixing characteristics are similar for the reacting and non-reacting cases. Mixing analyses reveal that vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy intensities peak in the jet shear layers, where vortex stretching is the dominant turbulence generation mechanism for all cases. Cases with lower freestream temperatures yield negligible heat release, while cases with elevated freestream temperatures exhibit chemical reactions primarily along the leading bow shock and within the boundary layer in the jet wake. The evaporative cooling quenches the chemical reactions in the primary atomization zone at the injection height, such that the flow rates of several product species plateau after x/d=20. Substantial concentrations of final product species are only observed along the bow shock-due to locally elevated temperature and pressure-and in the boundary layer far downstream-where lower flow velocities counteract the effects of prolonged ignition delays. This combination of factors leads to low combustion efficiency at the domain exit.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces, that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials.
  Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$, exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles.
  We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shockwave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous stochasticity and the Armstrong-Vicol passive scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous stochasticity refers to the emergence of intrinsic randomness in deterministic systems under singular limits, a phenomenon conjectured to be fundamental in turbulence. Armstrong and Vicol \citep{AV23,AV24} recently constructed a deterministic, divergence-free multiscale vector field arbitrarily close to a weak Euler solution, proving that a passive scalar transported by this field exhibits anomalous dissipation and lacks a selection principle in the vanishing diffusivity limit.
  {\it This work aims to explain why this passive scalar exhibits both Lagrangian and Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity.}
  Part I provides a historical overview of spontaneous stochasticity, details the Armstrong-Vicol passive scalar model, and presents numerical evidence of anomalous diffusion, along with a refined description of the Lagrangian flow map.
  In Part II, we develop a theoretical framework for Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity. We define it mathematically, linking it to ill-posedness and finite-time trajectory splitting, and explore its measure-theoretic properties and the connection to RG formalism. This leads us to a well-defined {\it measure selection principle} in the inviscid limit. This approach allows us to rigorously classify universality classes based on the ergodic properties of regularisations. To complement our analysis, we provide simple yet insightful numerical examples.
  Finally, we show that the absence of a selection principle in the Armstrong-Vicol model corresponds to Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity of the passive scalar. We also numerically compute the probability density of the effective renormalised diffusivity in the inviscid limit. We argue that the lack of a selection principle should be understood as a measure selection principle over weak solutions of the inviscid system.</description>

      <title>Radiative equilibrium boundary condition and correlation analysis on catalytic surfaces in DSMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study integrates radiative equilibrium boundary conditions on a catalytic surface within the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The radiative equilibrium boundary condition is based on the principle of energy conservation at each surface element, enabling the accurate capture of spatially varying surface temperatures and heat fluxes encountered during atmospheric re-entry. The surface catalycity is represented through the finite-rate surface chemistry (FRSC) model, specifically focusing on the heterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on silica surfaces. Both the FRSC model and the radiative equilibrium boundary conditions within the DSMC framework are validated through comparison to analytical solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted for rarefied hypersonic flow around a two-dimensional cylinder under representative re-entry conditions for both non-catalytic and catalytic surfaces. The results demonstrate significant discrepancies in computed surface properties between the radiative equilibrium and conventional isothermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, linear interpolation between results from two independent isothermal boundary conditions is shown to be inadequate for accurately predicting surface heat flux, particularly when surface reactions are considered. The observed discrepancies originate from a non-linear correlation between surface temperature and heat flux, influenced by factors such as surface catalycity and local geometric variations along the cylinder. These findings highlight the necessity of implementing radiative equilibrium boundary conditions within DSMC to ensure physically accurate aerothermodynamic computations.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance of intermittency in LES turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows exhibit large intermittent fluctuations from inertial to dissipative scales, characterized by multifractal statistics and breaking the statistical self-similarity. It has recently been proposed that the Navier-Stokes turbulence restores a hidden form of scale invariance in the inertial interval when formulated for a dynamically (nonlinearly) rescaled quasi-Lagrangian velocity field. Here we show that such hidden self-similarity extends to the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) approach in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, we show that classical subgrid-scale models, such as implicit or explicit Smagorinsky closures, respect the hidden scale invariance at all scales -- both resolved and subgrid. In the inertial range, they reproduce the hidden scale invariance of Navier-Stokes statistics. These properties are verified very accurately by numerical simulations and, beyond CFD, turn LES into a valuable tool for fundamental turbulence research.</description>

      <title>Optimal body force for heat transfer in turbulent vertical heated pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As buoyancy can help drive a flow, the vertical heated-pipe arrangement is widely used in thermal engineering applications. However, buoyancy suppresses and can even laminarise turbulence in the flow, thereby seriously damaging the heat transfer, measured by the Nusselt number Nu. As buoyancy, measured by the parameter C, is increased, three flow regimes are possible: shear-driven turbulence, laminarised flow, and convective turbulence. In Chu et al. (2024) we employed a variational optimisation method to investigate how the buoyancy changes the structure of the minimal flow perturbation that triggers turbulence. Here, we extend the method to find an optimal body force of limited magnitude that maximises heat transfer, and examine how time-dependence of the flow affects the optimisation in each of the three flow regimes. Optimisations are performed at Re = 3000, and the force is found to laminarise convective turbulence, or make it only weakly chaotic for C up to 8. Consistent with previous computations that assume steady flow, the optimal force induces streamwise-independent rolls, but at larger amplitude the force triggers time-dependent turbulent flow. Transition from the laminar streamwise-independent state to turbulent flow can either enhance Nu or reduce Nu. For highly chaotic flows, either shear turbulence at C = 1 or convective turbulence at C = 16, 32, optimisations place rolls closer to the wall than calculations with the steady flow assumption. At any given force amplitude, however, the enhanced Nu is only weakly dependent on the number of induced rolls.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional fluid stress field via photoelasticity using physics-informed convolutional encoder-decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring stress fields in fluids and soft materials is crucial in various fields such as mechanical engineering, medicine, and bioengineering. However, conventional methods that calculate stress fields from velocity fields struggle to measure complex fluids where the stress constitutive equation is unknown. To address this, we propose a novel approach that combines photoelastic measurements -- which can non-invasively visualize internal stresses -- with machine learning to measure stress fields. The machine learning model, which we named physics-informed convolutional encoder-decoder (PICED), integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder-decoder model with a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Using this approach, three-dimensional stress fields can be predicted with high accuracy for multiple interpolated data points in a rectangular channel flow.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking machine learning models for predicting aerofoil performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as alternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils used in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANS {\tt arXiv:2212.07564v3} dataset is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$). to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the testing phase, but underperformed during validation. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for incompressible multiphase flow in inhomogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a macroscopic model for the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in inhomogeneous porous medium. At the pore scale, the flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution of the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the volume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged behavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms related to spatial deviations. Then, spatial derivations are carefully modeled up to some undetermined coefficients, which could be evaluated by solving simplified closure problems in each representative volume element. In particular, the wetting behavior is incorporated into the averaged chemical potential. The differences between the proposed equations and the empirical two-phase Darcy-type models are discussed. Finally, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann model for the averaged equations is presented, and numerical results demonstrate the abilities of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Randomized Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for data-driven reduced order modeling of a two-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) serve as a simplified model for simulating wind-driven, stratified ocean flows. However, their numerical simulation remains computationally expensive due to the need for high-resolution meshes to capture a wide range of turbulent scales. This becomes especially problematic when several simulations need to be run because of, e.g., uncertainty in the parameter settings. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE that leverages randomized proper orthogonal decomposition (rPOD) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. To efficiently generate the snapshot data required for model construction, we apply a nonlinear filtering stabilization technique that allows for the use of larger mesh sizes compared to a direct numerical simulations (DNS). Thanks to the use of rPOD to extract the dominant modes from the snapshot matrices, we achieve up to 700 times speedup over the use of deterministic POD. LSTM networks are trained with the modal coefficients associated with the snapshots to enable the prediction of the time- and parameter-dependent modal coefficients during the online phase, which is hundreds of thousands of time faster than a DNS. We assess the accuracy and efficiency of our rPOD-LSTM ROM through an extension of a well-known benchmark called double-gyre wind forcing test. The dimension of the parameter space in this test is increased from two to four.</description>

Abstract: Using $10,\!080^3$ grid simulations, we analyze scale-dependent alignment in driven, compressible, no net-flux magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The plasma self-organizes into localized, strongly aligned regions. Alignment spans all primitive variables and their curls. Contrary to incompressible theory, velocity-magnetic alignment scales as $\theta(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{1/8}$, where $\lambda$ is the scale, suggesting a distinct three-dimensional eddy anisotropy and a much higher critical transition scale toward a reconnection-mediated cascade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose mesh-free fluid simulations that exploit a kinematic neural basis for velocity fields represented by an MLP. We design a set of losses that ensures that these neural bases satisfy fundamental physical properties such as orthogonality, divergence-free, boundary alignment, and smoothness. Our neural bases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the same fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in real-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate different domains and naturally extend to three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Role of flow topology in wind-driven wildfire propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires propagate through intricate interactions between wind, fuel, and terrain, resulting in complex behaviors that pose challenges for accurate predictions. This study investigates the interaction between wind velocity topology and wildfire spread dynamics, aiming to enhance our understanding of wildfire spread patterns. We revisited the non-dimensionalizion of the governing combustion model by incorporating three distinct time scales. This approach revealed two new non-dimensional numbers, contrasting with the conventional non-dimensionalization that considers only a single time scale. Through scaling analysis, we analytically identified the critical determinants of transient wildfire behavior and established a state-neutral curve, indicating where initial wildfires extinguish for specific combinations of the identified non-dimensional numbers. Subsequently, a wildfire transport solver was developed using a finite difference method, integrating compact schemes and implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. We explored the influence of stable and unstable manifolds in wind velocity on wildfire transport under steady wind conditions defined using a saddle-type fixed point flow, emphasizing the role of the non-dimensional numbers. Additionally, we considered the benchmark unsteady double-gyre flow and examined the effect of unsteady wind topology on wildfire propagation, and quantified the wildfire response to varying wind oscillation frequencies and amplitudes using a transfer function approach. The results were compared to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) used to characterize the correspondence of manifolds with wildfire propagation. The comprehensive approach of utilizing the manifolds computed from wind topology provides valuable insights into wildfire dynamics across diverse wind scenarios, offering a potential tool for improved predictive modeling and management strategies.</description>

      <title>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</title>

Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. An in-depth analysis is provided about the important role of separation distance between spheres played in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation at a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors</description>

      <title>Analytical model for balling defects in laser melting using rivulet theory and solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects and Oxygen Deficiency-Driven Pattern Transitions in Algal Bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously give rise to large scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, which is characterized by dense, cell-rich downwelling plumes interspersed with broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experimental observations with three dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interface conditions, cells accumulate near the surface due to negative gravitaxis, forming spiral shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like structures and give rise to downwelling plumes. Space-time analyses reveal coherent rotational dynamics, with inward moving patterns near the spiral core and bidirectional motion farther from the center. Introducing confinement by sealing the top boundary with an air impermeable transparent wall triggers striking transitions in the bioconvection patterns, driven by oxygen depletion: initially stable structures reorganize into new patterns with reduced characteristic wavelengths. Complementary 3D simulations, based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and incorporating negative buoyancy and active stress from swimming cells, capture the initial pattern formation and its subsequent instability, reproducing the fragmentation of spiral-shaped accumulations into downwelling plumes and the emergence of strong vortical flows, nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming speeds. However, these models do not capture the oxygen-driven pattern transitions observed experimentally. Our findings reveal that confinement geometry, oxygen dynamics, and metabolic transitions critically govern bioconvection pattern evolution, offering new strategies to control microbial self-organization and flow through environmental and geometric design.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transient CFD through Machine Learning-Based Flow Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but a significant portion of their computational cost stems from the time needed to reach statistical steadiness from initial conditions. We present a novel machine learning-based initialization method that reduces the cost of this subsequent transient solve substantially, achieving a 50% reduction in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics using a 16.7M-cell unsteady RANS simulation, we evaluate three ML-based initialization strategies. Two of these strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a physics-informed hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) a more versatile approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring only seconds of computation. We develop a robust statistical convergence metric based on windowed time-averaging for performance comparison between initialization strategies. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of automotive geometries, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The proposed methods integrate seamlessly with existing CFD workflows without requiring modifications to the underlying flow solver, providing a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations through improved ML-based initialization strategies.</description>
