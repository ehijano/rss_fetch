      <title>Shape and energy of a membrane on a liquid interface with arbitrary curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. We use the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress, and restrict ourselves to small slopes. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical energy minimization. Finally, we compute the energy of placing the sheet on the curved interface and find that it is much lower for positive Gaussian curvatures than for negative ones, that is, peaks and valleys are covered more efficiently than saddles.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Model for Active Plastic Flow of Epithelial Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal morphogenesis often involves significant shape changes of epithelial tissue sheets. Great progress has been made in understanding the underlying cellular driving forces and their coordination through biomechanical feedback loops. However, quantitative understanding of how cell-level dynamics translate into large-scale morphogenetic flows remains limited. A key challenge is finding the relevant macroscopic variables (order parameters) that retain the essential information about cell-scale structure. To address this challenge, we combine symmetry arguments with a stochastic mean-field model that accounts for the relevant microscopic dynamics. Complementary to previous work on the passive fluid- and solid-like properties of tissue, we focus on the role of actively generated internal stresses. Centrally, we use the timescale separation between elastic relaxation and morphogenetic dynamics to describe tissue shape change in quasi-static balance of forces within the tissue sheet. The resulting geometric structure - a triangulation in tension space dual to the polygonal cell tiling - proves ideal for developing a mean-field model. All parameters of the coarse-grained model are calculated from the underlying microscopic dynamics. Centrally, the model explains how active plastic flow driven by autonomous active cell rearrangements becomes self-limiting as previously observed in experiments and simulations. Additionally, the model quantitatively predicts tissue behavior when coupled with external fields, such as planar cell polarity and external forces. We show how such fields can sustain oriented active cell rearrangements and thus overcome the self-limited character of purely autonomous active plastic flow. These findings demonstrate how local self-organization and top-down genetic instruction together determine internally-driven tissue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalability of Graph Neural Network in Accurate Prediction of Force Chain Network in Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning force chain network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these force chains poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the GNN model's robustness and scalability across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides more accurate, cheaper, and faster predictions of suspension properties as compared to conventional methods, while using only small systems. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for predicting force chain networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited due to computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Geometrical and Vibrational Properties of the Defects Driving the Boson Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational density of states is key to understanding the mechanical, thermal, and transport properties of materials. In amorphous solids, this density shows an excess of vibrational modes compared to the Debye model, known as the boson peak, whose origin remains poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested a link between the boson peak and quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations, or "defects." However, it has been difficult to clearly identify these defects, possibly because they hybridize with extended phonons, casting doubt on their existence and connection to the boson peak. In this work, we introduce a simple and practical method for separating hybridized phonons from localized vibrations. We show that phonons at the boson peak frequency hybridize with localized defects. These defects are anisotropic, compact, and exhibit oscillatory pure shear deformations. Their density correlates with the excess of vibrational modes at the boson peak frequency across various two- and three-dimensional systems, confirming that they are the microscopic origin of the boson peak.</description>

      <title>How we simulate DNA origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA origami consists of a long scaffold strand and short staple strands that self-assemble into a target 2D or 3D shape. It is a widely used construct in nucleic acid nanotechnology, offering a cost-effective way to design and create diverse nanoscale shapes. With promising applications in areas such as nanofabrication, diagnostics, and therapeutics, DNA origami has become a key tool in the bionanotechnology field. Simulations of these structures can offer insight into their shape and function, thus speeding up and simplifying the design process. However, simulating these structures, often comprising thousands of base pairs, poses challenges due to their large size. OxDNA, a coarse-grained model specifically designed for DNA nanotechnology, offers powerful simulation capabilities. Its associated ecosystem of visualization and analysis tools can complement experimental work with in silico characterization. This tutorial provides a general approach to simulating DNA origami structures using the oxDNA ecosystem, tailored for experimentalists looking to integrate computational analysis into their design workflow.</description>

      <title>How flagellated bacteria wobble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flagellated bacterium navigates fluid environments by rotating its helical flagellar bundle. The wobbling of the bacterial body significantly influences its swimming behavior. To quantify the three underlying motions--precession, nutation, and spin, we extract the Euler angles from trajectories generated by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations, which is experimentally unattainable. In contrast to the common assumption, the cell body does not undergo complete cycles of spin, a general result for multiflagellated bacteria. Our simulations produce apparent wobbling periods that closely match the results of {\it E. coli} obtained from experiments and reveal the presence of two kinds of precession modes, consistent with theoretical analysis. Small-amplitude yet periodic nutation is also observed in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterising the slow dynamics of the swap Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The swap Monte Carlo algorithm introduces non-physical dynamic rules to accelerate the exploration of the configuration space of supercooled liquids. Its success raises deep questions regarding the nature and physical origin of the slow dynamics of dense liquids, and how it is affected by swap moves. We provide a detailed analysis of the slow dynamics generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm at very low temperatures in two glass-forming models. We find that the slowing down of the swap dynamics is qualitatively distinct from its local Monte Carlo counterpart, with considerably suppressed dynamic heterogeneity both at single-particle and collective levels. Our results suggest that local kinetic constraints are drastically reduced by swap moves, leading to nearly Gaussian and diffusive dynamics and weakly growing dynamic correlation lengthscales. The comparison between static and dynamic fluctuations shows that swap Monte Carlo is a nearly optimal local equilibrium algorithm, suggesting that further progress should necessarily involve collective or driven algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effective patchiness from critical points of a coarse-grained protein model with explicit shape and charge anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal model systems are successful in rationalizing emergent phenomena like aggregation, rheology and phase behaviour of protein solutions. Colloidal theory in conjunction with isotropic interaction models is often employed to estimate the stability of such solutions. In particular, a universal criterion for the reduced second virial coefficient at the critical point $B_2^*$ is frequently invoked which is based on the behavior of short-range attractive fluids (Noro-Frenkel rule, $B_2^*\approx-1.5$). However, if anisotropic models for the protein-protein interaction are considered, e.g. the Kern-Frenkel (KF) patchy particle model, the value of the $B_2^*$ criterion is shifted to lower values and explicitly depends on the number of patches. If an explicit shape anisotropy is considered, as e.g. in a coarse-grained protein model, the normalization of $B_2^*$ becomes ambiguous to some extent, as no unique exclusion volume can be defined anymore. Here, we investigate a low-resolution, coarse-grained model for the globular protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) and study effects of charge-anisotropy on the phase diagram (determined by simulations) at the isoelectric point. We present methods of assigning an ``effective patchiness'' to our protein model by comparing its critical properties to the KF model. We find that doubling the native charges increases the critical temperature $T_c$ by $\approx$ 14 % and that our BSA model can be compared to a 3 to 5 patch KF model. Finally, we argue that applying existing $B_2^*$ criteria from colloidal theory should be done with care, due to multiple, physically plausible ways of how to assign effective diameters to shape-anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>The role of compressional dynamics in setting the scale-dependent rheology of granular flows: Application to the emergence of thin layer stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One great challenge of modeling granular systems lies in capturing the rheologic dependencies on scale. For example, there are marked differences between quasi-static, intermediate, and rapid flow regimes. In this study, we demonstrate that assumptions for infinite stiffness of rigid particles, an assumption upon which the state-of the-art ($\mu(I)$-rheology) modeling approaches are constructed, must be relaxed in order to recover the physical mechanisms behind many scale-dependent and non-local rheological effects. Any relaxation of the infinite stiffness assumption allows for particles to compress in series, whereby the number of simultaneously compressed particles controls the extent to which end-member particles experience a modified coefficient of effective friction, analogous to reduced stiffness for springs in series. To demonstrate the importance of such a mechanism in setting the dynamics for dense rigid granular systems, we show that modifying simple models to include the kinematics introduced by compression in series captures the emergence of thin layer stability, a widely observed yet incompletely explained non-local granular phenomenon. We also discuss, in general, how knowledge of the contact network and softness provides a potential physical basis for the diffusion of granular temperature.</description>

      <title>Twisting vortex lines regularize Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.</description>

      <title>Physical model of serum supplemented medium flow in organ-on-a-chip systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a physiologically relevant shear stress in organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices requires careful tailoring of microfluidic flow parameters. It is currently fairly common to use a simple approximation assuming a constant viscosity, even for serum-based media. Here, we show that a popular nutrient solution (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum) requires a more complex treatment (i.e., is a non-Newtonian fluid), with observed shear stress values significantly greater than reported in literature. We measure the rheology of the solutions and combine it with a 3-dimensional flow field measurement to derive shear stress at the channel surface. We verify the experiments with numerical simulations, finding good agreement and deriving flow properties. Finally, we provide relevant expressions for shear stress approximation, suitable for development of OOC devices with various geometries.</description>

      <title>Exact and approximate solutions for elastic interactions in a nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic fluids appear in a diverse array of systems, from liquid-crystal displays to bacterial swarms, and are characterized by orientational order. Large colloidal particles immersed in such environments disturb the medium's orientational order, however, resulting in a stored elastic energy within the bulk. As a consequence, multiple immersed bodies interact at equilibrium through fluid-mediated forces and torques, which depend on the bodies' positions, orientations, and shapes. We provide the equilibrium configuration of a model nematic liquid crystal with multiple immersed bodies or inclusions in two-dimensions, as well as the associated body forces, torques, and surface tractions. A complex variables approach is taken which leans on previous work by Crowdy (2020) for describing solutions with multiply-connected domains. Free periods of a complex director field, which correspond to topological defect positioning and net topological charge, are determined numerically to minimize a global stored elastic energy, including a contribution of a weak (finite) anchoring strength on the body surfaces. Finally, a general, analytical description of two-body far-field interactions is provided, along with examples using two cylindrical inclusions of arbitrary position and size, and two triangles of arbitrary position and orientation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

Abstract: We present a collection of simulations of the Edwards-Anderson lattice spin glass at $T=0$ to elucidate the nature of low-energy excitations over a range of dimensions that reach from physically realizable systems to the mean-field limit. Using heuristic methods, we sample ground states of instances to determine their energies while eliciting excitations through manipulating boundary conditions. We exploit the universality of the phase diagram of bond-diluted lattices to make such a study in higher dimensions computationally feasible. As a result, we obtain a verity of accurate exponents for domain wall stiffness and finite-size corrections that allow us to examine their dimensional behavior and their connection with predictions from mean-field theory. We also provide an experimentally testable prediction for the thermal-to-percolative crossover exponent in dilute lattices Ising spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic response to different modes of ramping an external field in sparse and dense Ising spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the hysteretic behavior of Ising spin glasses at $T=0$ for various modes of driving. Previous studies mostly focused on an infinitely slow speed $\dot{H}$ by which the external field $H$ was ramped to trigger avalanches of spin flips by starting with destabilizing a single spin while few have focused on the effect of different driving methods. First, we show that this conventional protocol imposes a system size dependence. Then, we numerically analyze the response of Ising spin glasses at rates $\dot{H}$ that are fixed as well, to elucidate the differences in the response. Specifically, we compare three different modes of ramping ($\dot{H}=c/N$, $\dot{H}=c/\sqrt{N}$, and $\dot{H}=c$ for constant $c$) for two types of spin glass systems of size $N$, representing dense networks by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and sparse networks by the lattice spin glass in $d=3$ dimensions known as the Edwards Anderson model. Depending on the mode of ramping, we find that the response of each system, in form of spin-flip avalanches and other observables, can vary considerably. In particular, in the $N$-independent mode applied to the lattice spin glass, which is closest to experimental reality, we observe a percolation transition with a broad avalanche distribution between phases of localized and system-spanning responses. We explore implications for combinatorial optimization problems pertaining to sparse systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>
