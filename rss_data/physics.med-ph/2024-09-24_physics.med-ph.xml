      <title>Reflection Matrix Imaging for Wave Velocity Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides controlling wave trajectory inside complex media, wave velocity constitutes a relevant bio-marker for medical imaging. In a transmission configuration, wave-front distortions can be unscrambled to provide a map of the wave velocity landscape $c(\mathbf{r})$. However, most in-vivo applications correspond to a reflection configuration for which only back-scattered echoes generated by short-scale fluctuations of $c(\mathbf{r})$ can be harvested. Under a single scattering assumption, this speckle wave-field cannot provide the long-scale variations of $c(\mathbf{r})$. In this paper, we go beyond the first Born approximation and show how a map of $c(\mathbf{r})$ can be retrieved in epi-detection. To that aim, a reflection matrix approach of wave imaging is adopted. While standard reflection imaging methods generally rely on confocal focusing operations, matrix imaging consists in decoupling the location of the incident and received focal spots. Following this principle, a self-portrait of the focusing process can be obtained around each point of the medium. The Gouy phase shift exhibited by each focal spot is leveraged to finely monitor the wave velocity distribution $c(\mathbf{r})$ inside the medium. Experiment in a tissue-mimicking phantom and numerical simulations are first presented to validate our method. Speed-of-sound tomography is then applied to ultrasound data collected on the liver of a difficult-to-image patient. Beyond paving the way towards quantitative ultrasound, our approach can also be extremely rewarding for standard imaging. Indeed, each echo can be assigned to the actual position of a scatterer. It allows an absolute measurement of distance, an observable often used for diagnosis but generally extremely sensitive to wave velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>An Example of Microwave Diagnosis for Knee Osteophyte by 3D Parallel FD-FDTD Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parallel 3-D Frequency Dependent Finite Difference Time Domain (FD-FDTD) method was implemented based on the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) technique to analyze the feasibility of microwave diagnosis for the human knees. The parallel algorithm efficiently accelerates the FDTD computation for a large 3-D numerical knee model derived from a real human. Examinations in the frequency domain and time domain were applied to investigate the penetration of the electromagnetic (EM) waves into the knee. Results show that the attenuation of the microwave signal allows for a several-Gigahertz-bandwidth signal to be used for ultra-wide band microwave diagnosis. Knee osteophyte detection was undertaken as an example of the knee disease diagnosis to verify this technique. A small abnormal growth in the knee joint was successfully detected by the microwave imaging approach.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Characterization of Oral Soft Tissues in vivo Using the Burr Speckle Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodontal diseases, reportedly affect 4 out of 10 adults in the USA. The standard of care for clinical assessments of these diseases is invasive, subjective and semi-qualitative. Thus, research on proposing alternate noninvasive modalities for clinical assessments of periodontal tissues is crucial. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) has shown promises in noninvasive assessments of various diseases in soft biological tissues; however, it has not been employed in periodontology. Here as the first step, we focused on QUS-based characterization of two very adjacent oral soft tissues of alveolar mucosa and attached gingiva in an in vivo animal study. We investigated first order ultrasonic speckle statistics using the two-parameter Burr model (b and l). Our QUS analysis was compared with the Masson$'$s Trichrome histology images of the two oral tissue types quantitatively using the RGB color thresholding. QUS study included 10 swine and US scanning was performed at the first and second molars, resulting in 80 scans. US scan data was acquired at the frequency of 24 MHz. Results at both oral sites (molar 1 and molar 2) showed that difference between the two tissue types using Burr parameters were statistically significant (p$&lt;0.0001$). The average Burr b was reported higher in attached gingiva while the average Burr l was lower compared to mucosa. The color thresholding of these images confirmed that the percent of blue, which stains collagenous regions, was at least two times higher in gingiva compared with alveolar mucosa. It was suggested that the elevated Burr b (related to potential scatterer densities) in gingiva could be aligned with findings from histology. This study showed a promising potential of QUS for clinical assessment of periodontal soft tissues.</description>

      <title>Evaluating electrophysiological and behavioral measures of neural health in cochlear implant users: a computational simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural health refers to the condition and functionality of the auditory nerve fibers (ANFs),which are crucial for transmitting sound signals from the cochlea to the brain.However, neural health cannot be directly measured due to current technological limitations. We utilize a computational model to evaluate different indirect methods for estimating ANF neural health.Two distinct measures for estimating neural health,(i)the threshold levels for focused quadrupolar stimulation and (ii) the change in the electrically evoked compound action potential (eCAP) amplitude growth function for different inter-phase gaps (IPGs), were evaluated in a computational model of an electrically stimulated implanted cochlea. The model combined a 3D finite element method model, an ANF geometry with a realistic spatial distribution, and a neuron model, including an existing phenomenological single-ANF model and an eCAP model. Our experiments simulated different neural health conditions (healthy, shrinked, and degenerated) to model dead regions in different locations of the cochlea.The results from the computational experiments demonstrated that the threshold levels with focused quadrupolar stimulation were more sensitive to neural health deficits than thresholds with monopolar stimulation. From our data, the difference in threshold levels between quadrupolar and monopolar stimulation seems to be a promising measure of neural health status. However, the results from the eCAP IPG slope and offset effects were not consistently associated with neural health conditions.Our results suggest that the difference in threshold levels with quadrupolar and monopolar stimulation is a possible method for estimating neural health. Significance: This study enhances the understanding of neural health and dead regions through a novel computational model, contributing to new approaches for neural health estimation.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations for Speed-of-Sound Estimation in Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the speed-of-sound (SoS) is important for ultrasound (US) image reconstruction techniques and tissue characterization. Various approaches have been proposed to calculate SoS, ranging from tomography-inspired algorithms like CUTE to convolutional networks, and more recently, physics-informed optimization frameworks based on differentiable beamforming. In this work, we utilize implicit neural representations (INRs) for SoS estimation in US. INRs are a type of neural network architecture that encodes continuous functions, such as images or physical quantities, through the weights of a network. Implicit networks may overcome the current limitations of SoS estimation techniques, which mainly arise from the use of non-adaptable and oversimplified physical models of tissue. Moreover, convolutional networks for SoS estimation, usually trained using simulated data, often fail when applied to real tissues due to out-of-distribution and data-shift issues. In contrast, implicit networks do not require extensive training datasets since each implicit network is optimized for an individual data case. This adaptability makes them suitable for processing US data collected from varied tissues and across different imaging protocols.
  We evaluated the proposed SoS estimation method based on INRs using data collected from a tissue-mimicking phantom containing four cylindrical inclusions, with SoS values ranging from 1480 m/s to 1600 m/s. The inclusions were immersed in a material with an SoS value of 1540 m/s. In experiments, the proposed method achieved strong performance, clearly demonstrating the usefulness of implicit networks for quantitative US applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency content and filtering of head sensor kinematics: A method to enable field-based inter-study comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wearable head sensor systems use different kinematic signal processing approaches which limits field-based inter-study comparisons, especially when artefacts are present in the signal. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency content and characteristics of head kinematic signals from head impact reconstruction laboratory and field-based environments to develop an artefact attenuation filtering method (artefact attenuation method). Laboratory impacts (n=72) on a test-dummy headform ranging from 25-150 g were conducted and 126 elite-level rugby union players were equipped with instrumented mouthguards (iMG) for up to four matches. Power spectral density (PSD) characteristics of the laboratory impacts and on-field HAE (n=5694) such as the 95th percentile cumulative sum PSD frequency were utilised to develop the artefact attenuation method. The artefact attenuation method was compared to two other common filtering approaches (Fourth order (2x2 pole), zero-lag Butterworth filter with 200 Hz (-6 dB) cut-off frequency (Butterworth-200Hz) and CFC180 filter) through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mixed linear effects models for laboratory and on-field events, respectively. The artefact attenuation method produced an overall higher SNR than the Butterworth-200Hz and CFC180 filter and on-field peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak angular acceleration (PAA) values within the magnitude range tested in the laboratory. Median PLA and PAA were higher for the CFC180 filter than the Butterworth-200Hz (p&lt;0.01) and artefact attenuation method (p&lt;0.01), reporting values as high as 294 g and 31.2 krad/s2. The artefact attenuation method can be applied to all commercially available iMG kinematic signals with adequate sample rates to enable field-based inter-study comparisons.</description>

      <title>Haralick texture feature analysis for Monte Carlo dose distributions of permanent implant prostate brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Demonstrate quantitative characterization of 3D patient-specific absorbed dose distributions using Haralick texture analysis and interpret measures in terms of underlying physics and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Retrospective analysis is performed for 137 patients who underwent permanent implant prostate brachytherapy using two simulation conditions: ``TG186'' (realistic tissues including 0-3.8% intraprostatic calcifications; interseed attenuation) and ``TG43'' (water-model; no interseed attenuation). Haralick features (homogeneity, contrast, correlation, local homogeneity, entropy) are calculated using the original Haralick formalism, and a modified approach designed to reduce grey-level quantization sensitivity. Trends in textural features are compared to clinical dosimetric measures (D90; minimum absorbed dose to the hottest 90% of a volume) and changes in patient target volume % intraprostatic calcifications by volume (%IC). Results: Both original and modified measures quantify the spatial differences in absorbed dose distributions. Strong correlations between differences in textural measures calculated under TG43 and TG186 conditions and %IC are observed for all measures. For example, differences between measures of contrast and correlation increase and decrease respectively as patients with higher levels of %IC are evaluated, reflecting the large differences across adjacent voxels (higher dose in voxels with calcification) when calculated under TG186 conditions. Conversely, the D90 metric is relatively weakly correlated with textural measures, as it generally does not characterize the spatial distribution of absorbed dose. Conclusion: patient-specific 3D dose distributions may be quantified using Haralick analysis, and trends may be interpreted in terms of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Deep Evidential Learning for Radiotherapy Dose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel application of an uncertainty-quantification framework called Deep Evidential Learning in the domain of radiotherapy dose prediction. Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity, compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence intervals.</description>
