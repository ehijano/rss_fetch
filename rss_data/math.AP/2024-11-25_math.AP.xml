      <title>On a fractional boundary version of Talenti's inequality in the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work of Ferone and Volzone arXiv:2007.13195, we derive sufficient conditions for the validity and non-validity of a boundary version of Talenti's comparison principle in the context of Dirichlet-Poisson problems for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ in the unit ball $\Omega= B_1(0) \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, our results imply a universial failure of the classical pointwise Talenti inequality in the fractional radial context which sheds new light on the one-dimensional counterexamples given in arXiv:2007.13195.</description>

      <title>New dimensional bounds for a branched transport problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a branched transport problem with weakly imposed boundary conditions. This problem arises as a reduced model for pattern formation in type-I superconductors. For this model, it is conjectured that the dimension of the boundary measure is non-integer. We prove this conjecture in a simplified 2D setting, under the (strong) assumption of Ahlfors regularity of the irrigated measure. This work is the first rigorous proof of a singular behaviour for irrigated measures resulting from minimality.</description>

      <title>Internal waves in a 2D subcritical channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering and evolution aspects of linear internal waves in a two dimensional channel with subcritical bottom topography. We define the scattering matrix for the stationary problem and use it to show a limiting absorption principle for the internal wave operator. As a result of the limiting absorption principle, we show the leading profile of the internal wave in the long time evolution is a standing wave whose spatial component is outgoing.</description>

      <title>On Mean Field Games in Infinite Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Mean Field Games (MFG) system in a real, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The system consists of a second order parabolic type equation, called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the paper, coupled with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Both equations contain a Kolmogorov operator. Solutions to the HJB equation are interpreted in the mild solution sense and solutions to the FP equation are interpreted in an appropriate weak sense. We prove well-posedness of the considered MFG system under certain conditions. The existence of a solution to the MFG system is proved using Tikhonov's fixed point theorem in a proper space. Uniqueness of solutions is obtained under typical separability and Lasry-Lions type monotonicity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lane-Emden equation with a supercritical nonlinearity with an inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on an infinite cone. Under suitable conditions for the boundary data and the exponent of nonlinearity, we give a complete classification of the existence/nonexistence of a solution with respect to the size of boundary data. Moreover, we give a result on the multiple existence of solutions via bifurcation theory. We also state results on Hardy-H\'enon equations on infinite cones as a generalization.</description>

      <title>Higher order Schr\"odinger equations on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following higher order Schr\"odinger equation on hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$: $P_m u +a(x) u = |u|^{q - 2}u,$ where $P_m$ is the $2m$ order GJMS operator, $q=\frac{2n}{n-2m}$, $a(x) \in L^{\frac{n}{2m}}(\mathbb{H}^n)$ is a nonnegative potential function. We obtain a new concentration compactness principal for higher order problems on hyperbolic spaces. Under certain integrability assumptions on $a(x)$, we obtain the existence of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Quantized Vortex Dynamics of the Coupled Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive rigorously the reduced dynamical law for quantized vortex dynamics of the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation without Josephson junction (CNLS) when the core size of vortex $\varepsilon\to 0$. It is proved that when $\varepsilon\to 0$, the vortex motion of one component won't affect the vortex motion on the other component. Moreover, the motion of vortices of each component follows the vortex motion law for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for 2D Log Gas on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the first time for the 2D Log gas or the weakly interacting particle systems with 2D Coulomb interactions on the whole space. We resolve this problem by adapting the modulated free energy method in [BJW23] to the whole space setting and establishing the crucial logarithmic growth estimates for the mean-field Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation of single component via the parabolic maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Length-constrained, length-penalised and free elastic flows of planar curves inside cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of smooth, embedded, regular planar curves $ \alpha : \left [-1,1 \right ]\times \left [0,T \right )\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ with generalised Neumann boundary conditions inside cones, satisfying three variants of the fourth-order nonlinear $L^2$- gradient flow for the elastic energy: (1) elastic flow with a length penalisation, (2) elastic flow with fixed length and (3) the unconstrained or `free' elastic flow. Assuming neither end of the evolving curve reaches the cone tip, existence of smooth solutions for all time given quite general initial data is well known, but classification of limiting shapes is generally not known. For cone angles not too large and with suitable smallness conditions on the $L^2$-norm of the first arc length derivative of curvature of the initial curve, we prove in cases (1) and (2) smooth exponential convergence of solutions in the $C^\infty$-topology to particular circular arcs, while in case (3), we show smooth convergence to an expanding self-similar arc.</description>

      <title>Spectral regularity with respect to dilations for a class of pseudodifferential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the perturbation problem discussed in \cite{CP3} and get rid of the 'slow variation' assumption by considering symbols of the form $a\big(x+\delta\,F(x),\xi\big)$ with $a$ a real H\"{o}rmander symbol of class $S^0_{0,0}(\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $F$ a smooth function with all its derivatives globally bounded, with $|\delta|\leq1$. We prove that while the Hausdorff distance between the spectra of the Weyl quantization of the above symbols in a neighbourhood of $\delta=0$ is still of the order $\sqrt{|\delta|}$, the distance between their spectral edges behaves like $|\delta|^\nu$ with $\nu\in[1/2,1)$ depending on the rate of decay of the second derivatives of $F$ at infinity.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedness of the Free-boundary Incompressible Elastodynamics with Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the local well-posedness of the 3D free-boundary incompressible elastodynamics with surface tension describing the motion of an elastic medium in a periodic domain with a moving graphical surface. The deformation tensor is assumed to satisfy the neo-Hookean linear elasticity. We adapt the idea in arXiv:2312.11254 to generate an approximate problem with artificial viscosity indexed by $\kappa &gt; 0$ to boost the boundary regularity, which recovers the original system as $\kappa\to 0$, and the energy estimates yield no regularity loss.</description>

      <title>On a local solvability of the contact Muskat problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we discuss the two-dimensional contact Muskat problem with zero surface tension of a free boundary. The initial shape of the unknown interface is a smooth simple curve which forms acute corners $\delta_{0}$ and $\delta_{1}$ with fixed boundaries. Under suitable assumptions on the given data, the one-to-one local classical solvability of this problem is proved. We also describe the sufficient conditions on the data in the model which provide the existence of the "waiting time" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On Temporal Decay of Compressible Hookean Viscoelastic Fluids with Relatively Large Elasticity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Jiang--Jiang (J. Differential Equations 282, 2021) showed the existence of unique strong solutions in spatial periodic domain (denoted by $\mathbb{T}^3$), whenever the elasticity coefficient is larger than the initial velocity perturbation of the rest state. Motivated by Jiang--Jiang's result, we revisit the Cauchy problem of the compressible viscoelastic fluids in Lagrangian coordinates. Employing an energy method with temporal weights and an additional asymptotic stability condition of initial density in Lagrangian coordinates, we extend the Jiang--Jiang's result with exponential decay-in-time in $\mathbb{T}^3$ to the one with algebraic decay-in-time in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Thanks to the algebraic decay of solutions established by the energy method with temporal weights, we can further use the spectral analysis to improve the temporal decay rate of solutions. In particular, we find that the $k$-th order spatial derivatives of both the density and deformation perturbations converge to zero in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ at a rate of $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k+1}{2}}$, which is faster than the decay rate $(1 +t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ obtained by Hu--Wu (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 45, 2013) for $k=0$ and $ 1$. In addition, it's well-known that the decay rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ of the density perturbation is optimal in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations (A.~Matsumura, T.~Nishida, Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser-A. 55, 1979). Therefore, our faster temporal decay rates indicate that the elasticity accelerates the decay of the density perturbation after the rest state of a compressible viscoelastic fluid being perturbed.</description>

      <title>A model for heat generation by acoustic waves in piezoelectric materials: Global large-data solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the generation of heat due to mechanical losses during acoustic wave propagation in a solid is considered in a Kelvin-Voigt type framework. In contrast to previous studies on related thermoviscoelastic models, in line with recent experimental findings the present manuscript focuses on situations in which elastic parameters depend on temperature. Despite an apparent loss of mathematically favorable structural properties thereby encountered, in the framework of a suitably generalized concept of solvability a result on global existence of solutions is derived under mild assumptions which, in particular, do not involve any smallness condition on the initial data.</description>

      <title>A refined Lusin type theorem for gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a refined version of the celebrated Lusin type theorem for gradients by Alberti, stating that any Borel vector field $f$ coincides with the gradient of a $C^1$ function $g$, outside a set $E$ of arbitrarily small Lebesgue measure. We replace the Lebesgue measure with any Radon measure $\mu$, and we obtain that the estimate on the $L^p$ norm of $Dg$ does not depend on $\mu(E)$, if the value of $f$ is $\mu$-a.e. orthogonal to the decomposability bundle of $\mu$. We observe that our result implies the 1-dimensional version of the flat chain conjecture by Ambrosio and Kirchheim on the equivalence between metric currents and flat chains with finite mass in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we state a suitable generalization for $k$-forms, which would imply the validity of the conjecture in full generality.</description>

      <title>Regularity, uniqueness and the relative size of small and large scales in SQG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of regularity and uniqueness are open for the supercritically dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equations in certain classes. In this note we examine the extent to which small or large scales are necessarily active both for the temperature in a hypothetical blow-up scenario and for the error in hypothetical non-uniqueness scenarios, the latter understood within the class of Marchand's solutions. This extends prior work for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The extension is complicated by the fact that mild solution techniques are unavailable for supercritical SQG. This forces us to develop a new approach using energy methods and Littlewood-Paley theory.</description>

      <title>The 1D nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation with a top hat kernel. Part 3. The effect of perturbations in the kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the third part of this series of papers, we address the same Cauchy problem that was considered in part 1, namely the nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation in one spatial dimension, $u_t = D u_{xx} + u(1-\phi_T*u)$, where $\phi_T*u$ is a spatial convolution with the top hat kernel, $\phi_T(y) \equiv H\left(\frac{1}{4}-y^2\right)$, except that now we include a specified perturbation to this kernel, which we denote as $\overline{\phi}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$. Thus the top hat kernel $\phi_T$ is now replaced by the perturbed kernel $\phi:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\phi(x) = \phi_T(x) + \overline{\phi}(x)~~\forall~~x\in \mathbb{R}$. When the magnitude of the kernel perturbation is small in a suitable norm, the situation is shown to be generally a regular perturbation problem when the diffusivity $D$ is formally of O(1) or larger. However when $D$ becomes small, and in particular, of the same order as the magnitude of the perturbation to the kernel, this becomes a strongly singular perturbation problem, with considerable changes in overall structure. This situation is uncovered in detail In terms of its generic interest, the model forms a natural extension to the classical Fisher-KPP model, with the introduction of the simplest possible nonlocal effect into the saturation term. Nonlocal reaction-diffusion models arise naturally in a variety of (frequently biological or ecological) contexts, and as such it is of fundamental interest to examine its properties in detail, and to compare and contrast these with the well known properties of the classical Fisher-KPP model.</description>

Abstract: We utilize a modulation restricted normal form approach to establish local well-posedness of the periodic Korteweg-de Vries equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&gt; -\frac23$. This work creates an analogue of the mKdV result by Nakanishi, Takaoka, and Tsutsumi for KdV, extending the currently best-known result of $s \geq -\frac12$ without utilizing the theory of complete integrability.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of unidimensional pressureless Euler equations yields global strong solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing compressible fluids are prone to the formation of shock singularities, arising from faster upstream fluid particles catching up to slower, downstream ones. In geometric terms, this causes the deformation map to leave the manifold of diffeomorphisms. Information geometric regularization addresses this issue by changing the manifold geometry to make it geodesically complete. Empirical evidence suggests that this results in smooth solutions without adding artificial viscosity. This work makes a first step towards understanding this phenomenon rigorously, in the setting of the unidimensional pressureless Euler equations. It shows that their information geometric regularization has smooth global solutions. By establishing $\Gamma$-convergence of its variational description, it proves convergence of these solutions to entropy solutions of the nominal problem, in the limit of vanishing regularization parameter. A consequence of these results is that manifolds of unidimensional diffeomorphisms with information geometric regularization are geodesically complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a finite-time blow-up solution to the mass-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a metric star graph with an arbitrary number of edges. We show that all solutions are global if their mass is smaller than an explicit constant, called "minimal mass". We then construct a solution with minimal mass and arbitrary energy, which blows up in finite time at the vertex of the star graph. The blow-up profile and blow-up speed are explicitly characterized. The main novelty of the paper is the construction of the blow-up profile in time-dependent domains of singularly perturbed Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Geometry and analytic properties of the sliced Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein metric compares probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by taking averages of the Wasserstein distances between projections of the measures to lines. The distance has found a range of applications in statistics and machine learning, as it is easier to approximate and compute in high dimensions than the Wasserstein distance. While the geometry of the Wasserstein metric is quite well understood, and has led to important advances, very little is known about the geometry and metric properties of the sliced Wasserstein (SW) metric. Here we show that when the measures considered are "nice" (e.g. bounded above and below by positive multiples of the Lebesgue measure) then the SW metric is comparable to the (homogeneous) negative Sobolev norm $\dot H^{-(d+1)/2}$. On the other hand when the measures considered are close in the infinity transportation metric to a discrete measure, then the SW metric between them is close to a multiple of the Wasserstein metric. We characterize the tangent space of the SW space, show that the speed of curves in the space can be described by a quadratic form, but that the SW space is not a length space. We establish a number of properties of the metric given by the minimal length of curves between measures -- the SW length. Finally we highlight the consequences of these properties to the gradient flows in the SW metric.</description>

Abstract: We prove resolvent estimates for a Schr\"odinger operator with a short-range potential outside an obstacle with Dirichlet boundary conditions. As a consequence, we deduce integrability of the local energy for the wave equation, and smoothing effect for the Schr\"odinger equation. Finally, for both equations, we prove that local Strichartz estimates for the free equation outside an obstacle imply global Strichartz estimates with a short-range potential outside the same obstacle. The estimates are all global in time, after projection on the continuous spectrum of the operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical derivation of stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We consider many-particle systems with a Hamiltonian dynamics supplemented by a friction term and environmental noise. Both the interaction potential and the additional friction force are supposed to be long range in comparison with the typical distance between neighboring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of the stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations of a barotropic fluid. Moreover, we quantify the distance between particles and the limit in suitable in Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev regularity for widely degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local weak solutions to the widely degenerate parabolic PDE \[ \partial_{t}u-\mathrm{div}\left((\vert Du\vert-\lambda)_{+}^{p-1}\frac{Du}{\vert Du\vert}\right)=f\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{in}\,\,\,\Omega_{T}=\Omega\times(0,T), \] where $p\geq2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $\lambda$ is a non-negative constant and $\left(\,\cdot\,\right)_{+}$ stands for the positive part. Assuming that the datum $f$ belongs to a suitable Lebesgue-Besov parabolic space when $p&gt;2$ and that $f\in L_{loc}^{2}(\Omega_{T})$ if $p=2$, we prove the Sobolev spatial regularity of a novel nonlinear function of the spatial gradient of the weak solutions. This result, in turn, implies the existence of the weak time derivative for the solutions of the evolutionary $p$-Poisson equation. The main novelty here is that $f$ only has a Besov or Lebesgue spatial regularity, unlike the previous work [6], where $f$ was assumed to possess a Sobolev spatial regularity of integer order. We emphasize that the results obtained here can be considered, on the one hand, as the parabolic analog of some elliptic results established in [5], and on the other hand as the extension to a strongly degenerate setting of some known results for less degenerate parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layers for Stokes Systems in Periodic Homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotics of boundary layers in periodic homogenization. The analysis is focused on a Stokes system with periodic coefficients and periodic Dirichlet data posed in the half-space $\{y\in \mathbb{R}^d: y\cdot n -s&gt;0\}$. In particular, we establish the convergence of the velocity as $y\cdot n \rightarrow \infty$. We obtain this convergence for arbitrary normals $n\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Moreover, we build an asymptotic expansion of Poisson's kernel for the periodically oscillating Stokes operator in the half-space. The presence of the pressure and the incompressibility condition impose certain innovations. In particular, we provide a framework for the analysis of the boundary layers in homogenization that relies only on physical space techniques and not on techniques that rely on the quasiperiodic structure of the problem.</description>

      <title>On singular behaviour in a plane linear elastostatics problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vector field similar to those separately introduced by Artstein and Dafermos is constructed from the tangent to a monotone increasing one-parameter family of non-concentric circles that touch at the common point of intersection taken as the origin. The circles define and space-fill a lens shaped region $\Omega$ whose outer and inner boundaries are the greatest and least circles. The double cusp at the origin creates a geometric singularity at which the vector field is indeterminate and has non-unique limiting behaviour. A semi-inverse method that involves the Airy stress function then shows that the vector field corresponds to the displacement vector field for a linear plane compressible non-homogeneous isotropic elastostatic equilibrium problem in $\Omega$ whose boundaries are rigidly rotated relative to each other, possibly causing rupture or tearing at the origin. A sequence of solutions is found for which not only are the Lam\'{e} parameters strongly-elliptic, but the non-unique limiting behaviour of the displacement is preserved. Other properties of the vector field are also established.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a question of Tsai-Tsui-Wang, we consider the rigidity of map from manifolds with positive Ricci curvature to manifolds with positive sectional curvature. We show that if the Ricci curvature of the domain dominates that of the target, then distance non-increasing maps must be either Riemannian submersion or isometry. The rigidity result also holds on a wider class of manifolds with positive curvature and weaker contracting property on the map. This is based on a new long-time existence of harmonic map heat flow.</description>

Abstract: We present a full space-time numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation using a continuous Galerkin finite element method on conforming meshes. The Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a space-time continuous-Galerkin finite element method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. To ensure stability of the discrete variational problem, we apply ideas from the variational multi-scale method. The finite element problem is posed on the ``full" space-time domain, considering time as another dimension. We provide a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence of the stabilized formulation. And finally, we apply this method on two benchmark problems in computational fluid dynamics, namely, lid-driven cavity flow and flow past a circular cylinder. We validate the current method with existing results from literature and show that very large space-time blocks can be solved using our approach.</description>
