      <title>The role of the Allee effect in common-pool resource and its sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of common-pool resources is a complex challenge due to the risk of overexploitation and the tragedy of the commons. A novel framework has been introduced to address this issue, focusing on the coevolutionary relationship between human behavior and common-pool resources within a human-environment system. However, the impact of the Allee effect on the coevolution and its resource sustainability is still unexplored. The Allee effect, a biological phenomenon characterized by a correlation between resource availability and growth rate, is a fundamental attribute of numerous natural resources. In this paper, we introduce two coevolutionary models of resource and strategy under replicator dynamics and knowledge feedback by applying the Allee effect to the common-pool resources within human-environment system. These models encapsulate various facets of resource dynamics and the players' behavior, such as resource growth function, the extraction rates, and the strategy update rules. We find that the Allee effect can induce bi-stability and critical transition, leading to either sustainable or unsustainable outcomes depending on the initial condition and parameter configuration. We demonstrate that knowledge feedback enhances the resilience and sustainability of the coevolving system, and these results advances the understanding of human-environment system and management of common-pool resources.</description>

      <title>Dynamic opinion updating with endogenous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is a well-documented phenomenon across a wide range of social issues. However, prevailing theories often compartmentalize the examination of herding behavior and opinion convergence within different contexts. In this study, we delve into the micro-foundations of how individuals strategically select reference groups, offering insight into a dynamic process where both individual opinions and the network evolve simultaneously. We base our model on two parameters: people's direct benefit from connections and their adaptability in adjusting their opinions. Our research highlights which conditions impede the network from achieving complete connectivity, resulting in enduring polarization. Notably, our model also reveals that polarization can transiently emerge during the transition towards consensus. We explore the connection between these scenarios and a critical network metric: the initial diameter, under specific conditions related to the initial distribution of opinions.</description>

      <title>New characterizations of completely useful topologies in mathematical utility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an arbitrary set. Then a topology $t$ on $X$ is said to be completely useful if every upper semicontinuous linear (total) preorder $\precsim$ on $X$ can be represented by an upper semicontinuous real-valued order preserving function. In this paper, appealing, simple and new characterizations of completely useful topologies will be proved, therefore clarifying the structure of such topologies.</description>
