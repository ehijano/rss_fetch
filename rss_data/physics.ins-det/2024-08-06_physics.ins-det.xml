      <title>Feasibility of Liquid-phase Xenon Proportional Scintillation for Low-energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) detect both the scintillation photons and ionization electrons created by energy depositions within the liquid xenon (LXe) volume. The electrons are extracted from the interaction site through a gas gap, where they meet a high electric field where proportional scintillation occurs. This converts the electron signal into a light signal, and yields a high electron detection efficiency with a gain of tens of photoelectrons (PE) per electron. This technique of detecting both scintillation and ionization gives dual phase xenon TPCs the capability to distinguish between electronic and nuclear recoils, which is a key part of how these detectors are able to reach world-leading limits on Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter. However, not all electrons can be extracted through the liquid-gas interface, and a constant millimeter-scale gas gap needs to be maintained, which may be a technological challenge if dual-phase xenon TPCs are to be scaled up for future dark matter searches. Furthermore, there is a background of single-electron peaks that follow a large ionization signal (S2) of unclear origin which may be due in part to the liquid-gas interface, and limits the sensitivity of these detectors towards low mass dark matter. In this paper, we demonstrate that a purely single-phase liquid xenon TPC which produces proportional scintillation directly in the liquid is still capable of discriminating between electronic and nuclear recoils, but that the background of single-electrons following an S2 is still likely unrelated to the liquid-gas interface.</description>

      <title>Liquid Scintillators; Technology and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief review of liquid scintillators, an important technology for detection of ionizing radiation. We will first review the basic mechanisms of light production in most organic liquid scintillators. For most practical detector applications, the scintillators need to be optimized for choices of photosensors and compatibility with optical windows. A summary of important past experimental projects with liquid scintillators is provided. We will complete the review with a list of modern practices, particularly of metal doping, and development of water based hybrid materials that allow simultaneous detection of Cherenkov and scintillation light.</description>

      <title>A High-frequency, Low-power Resonant Radio-frequency Neutron Spin Flipper for High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a resonant-mode, transverse-field, radio-frequency (rf) neutron spin flipper design that uses high-temperature superconducting films to ensure sharp transitions between uniform magnetic field regions. Resonant mode allows for low power, high frequency operation but requires strict homogeneity of the magnetic fields inside the device. This design was found to efficiently flip neutrons at 96.6$\pm 0.6\%$ at an effective frequency of 4 MHz with a beam size of $2.5~\times~2.5$~cm and a wavelength of 0.4 nm. The high frequency and efficiency enable this device to perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy with comparable performance to currently implemented rf flipper designs. The limitation of the maximum frequency was found due to the field homogeneity of the device. We numerically analyze the maximum possible efficiency of this design using a Bloch solver simulation with magnetic fields generated from finite-element simulations. We also discuss future improvements of the efficiency and frequency to the design based on the experimental and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Applications of CMOS technology at the ALICE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) combine the sensing part and the front-end electronics in the same silicon layer, making use of CMOS technology. Profiting from the progresses of this commercial process, MAPS have been undergoing significant advances over the last decade in terms of integration densities, radiation hardness and readout speed. The first application of MAPS in high energy physics has been the PXL detector, installed in 2014 as the vertexer of the STAR experiment at BNL. In the same years, ALICE Collaboration started the development of a new MAPS with improved performances, to assemble a new detector to replace the Inner Tracking System used during LHC Run 1 and 2. This effort lead to the ALPIDE sensor, today successfully equipped in a large variety of systems. Starting from 2019, profiting from the experience acquired during the design of the ALPIDE sensor, the ALICE Collaboration embarked on a new development phase, the ITS3 project. Here the goal is to design the first truly cylindrical detector based on wafer-size sensors in 65 nm CMOS node. This new detector is expected to take data during LHC Run 4. ALICE Collaboration submitted a proposal for a new experiment, to be installed in place of the present detector system before the LHC Run 5. Building on the experience on MAPS acquired in the recent years, the idea is to design a compact all silicon detector, that will give unprecedented insight into the quark-gluon plasma characterization.</description>

      <title>Design and Construction of a Test-Stand for the Split and Delay Line at the European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the design and construction of a test-stand for the Split and Delay Line (SDL) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) in Hamburg, Germany. The advancements in Free Electron Laser technology have now made it possible to investigate ultra-fast dynamics in materials science, biology, chemistry, etc. In the SDL, an incident free electron laser pulse is split into two parts by a beam splitter: one half travels along the upper branch, and the other half travels along the lower branch. These two pulses can either merge again in the collinear mode or travel along different optical paths toward the sample in the inclined mode. This setup achieves a temporal separation of a few femtoseconds between the X-ray pulse pairs, which is crucial for ultra-fast X-ray pump-probe experiments investigating rapid dynamics. This report provides detailed documentation of the mechanical and electronic configuration of the test-stand, vacuum testing, the manufacturing of supporting cables, and the challenges encountered during the project. Finally, the SDL was successfully assembled and initially validated under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) operating conditions.</description>

      <title>First results on new helium based eco-gas mixtures for the Extreme Energy Events Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extreme Energy Events (EEE) Project, a joint project of the Centro Fermi (Museo Storico della Fisica e Centro Studi e Ricerche "E.Fermi") and INFN, has a dual purpose: a scientific research program on cosmic rays at ground level and an intense outreach and educational program. The project consists in a network of about 60 tracking detectors, called telescopes, mostly hosted in Italian High Schools. Each telescope is made by three Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers, operated so far with a gas mixture composed by 98% C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$ and 2% SF$_6$. Due to its high Global Warming Potential, a few years ago the EEE collaboration has started an extensive R&amp;D on alternative mixtures environmentally sustainable and compatible with the current experimental setup and operational environment. Among other gas mixtures, the one with helium and hydrofluoroolefin R1234ze gave the best result during the preliminary tests performed with two of the network telescopes. The detector has proved to reach performance levels comparable to those obtained with previous mixtures, without any modification of the hardware. We will discuss the first results obtained with the new mixture, tested with different percentages of the two components.</description>

      <title>SuperBIT Superpressure Flight Instrument Overview and Performance: Near diffraction-limited Astronomical Imaging from the Stratosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SuperBIT was a 0.5-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wide-field telescope that launched on a NASA superpressure balloon into the stratosphere from New Zealand for a 45-night flight. SuperBIT acquired multi-band images of galaxy clusters to study the properties of dark matter using weak gravitational lensing. We provide an overview of the instrument and its various subsystems. We then present the instrument performance from the flight, including the telescope and image stabilization system, the optical system, the power system, and the thermal system. SuperBIT successfully met the instrument's technical requirements, achieving a telescope pointing stability of 0.34 +/- 0.10 arcseconds, a focal plane image stability of 0.055 +/- 0.027 arcseconds, and a PSF FWHM of ~ 0.35 arcseconds over 5-minute exposures throughout the 45-night flight. The telescope achieved a near-diffraction limited point-spread function in all three science bands (u, b, and g). SuperBIT served as a pathfinder to the GigaBIT observatory, which will be a 1.34-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared balloon-borne telescope.</description>

      <title>All-optical atomic magnetometry using an elliptically polarized amplitude-modulated light wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a resonant interaction of an elliptically polarized light wave with $^{87}$Rb vapor (D$_1$ line) exposed to a transverse magnetic field. A $5$$\times$$5$$\times$$5$~mm$^3$ glass vapor cell is used for the experiments. The wave intensity is modulated at the frequency $\Omega_m$. By scanning $\Omega_m$ near the Larmor frequency $\Omega_L$, a magnetic resonance (MR) can be observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the wave polarization. This method for observing MR allows to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio compared to a classical Bell-Bloom scheme using a circularly polarized wave. The sensitivity of the magnetic field sensor is estimated to be $\approx\,$$130$~fT/$\surd$Hz in a $2$~kHz bandwidth, confidently competing with widely used Faraday-rotation Bell-Bloom schemes. The results can be used to develop a miniature all-optical magnetic field sensor for medicine and geophysics.</description>

      <title>First search for dark photon dark matter with a MADMAX prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 3.0 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.2 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Pixel Charging-up effect in Gas Micro-Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the charging-up effect on the Topmetal-II- chip in Gas Micro-Pixel Detectors(GMPD). It is found that this effect differs from the charging-up typically observed in gas detector multiplier devices and increases the relative gain of the detector. The research indicates that this effect originates from the accumulation of charges on the insulating layer of the chip's pixel surface. Iterative simulations using COMSOL and GARFIELD++ are employed to model the variation of detector relative gain with the charging-up effect, and a simple yet effective model is proposed, which aligns well with experimental data. The feasibility of validating the deposition of resistive materials and adjusting the local voltage distribution on the chip to suppress charging-up effects and enhance the relative gain is also verified.</description>

      <title>8x8 Patch-Antenna-Coupled TeraFET Detector Array for Terahertz Quantum-Cascade-Laser Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolithically integrated, antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) are rapid and sensitive detectors for the terahertz range (0.3-10~THz) that can operate at room temperature. We conducted experimental characterizations of a single patch-antenna coupled TeraFET optimized for 3.4~THz operation and its integration into an 8x8 multi-element detector configuration. In this configuration, the entire TeraFET array operates as a unified detector element, combining the output signals of all detector elements. Both detectors were realized using a mature commercial Si-CMOS 65-nm process node. Our experimental characterization employed single-mode Quantum-Cascade Lasers (QCLs) emitting at 2.85~THz and 3.4~THz. The 8x8 multi-element detector yields two major improvements for sensitive power detection experiments. First, the larger detector area simplifies alignment and enhances signal stability. Second, the reduced detector impedance enabled the implementation of a TeraFET+QCL system capable of providing a -3~dB modulation bandwidth up to 21~MHz, which is currently limited primarily by the chosen readout circuitry. Finally, we validate the system's performance by providing high resolution gas spectroscopy data for methanol vapor around 3.4~THz, where a detection limit of 1.6e-5 absorbance, or 2.6e11~molecules/cm^3 was estimated under optimal coupling conditions.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a direct current (DC) acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state radiofrequency (RF) amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

      <title>Comparative studies of plastic scintillator strips with high technical attenuation length for the total-body J-PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic scintillator strips are considered as one of the promising solutions for the cost-effective construction of total-body positron emission tomography, (PET) system. The purpose of the performed measurements is to compare the transparency of long plastic scintillators with dimensions 6 mm x 24 mm x 1000 mm and with all surfaces polished. Six different types of commercial, general purpose, blue-emitting plastic scintillators with low attenuation of visible light were tested, namely: polyvinyl toluene-based BC-408, EJ-200, RP-408, and polystyrene-based Epic, SP32 and UPS-923A. For determination of the best type of plastic scintillator for totalbody Jagiellonian positron emission tomograph (TB-J-PET) construction, emission and transmission spectra, and technical attenuation length (TAL) of blue light-emitting by the scintillators were measured and compared. The TAL values were determined with the use of UV lamp as excitation source, and photodiode as light detector. Emission spectra of investigated scintillators have maxima in the range from 420 nm to 429 nm. The BC-408 and EJ-200 have the highest transmittance values of about 90% at the maximum emission wavelength measured through a 6 mm thick scintillator strip and the highest technical attenuation length reaching about 2000 mm, allowing assembly of long detection modules for time-of-flight (TOF) J-PET scanners. Influence of the 6 mm x 6 mm, 12 mm x 6 mm, 24 mm x 6 mm cross-sections of the 1000 mm long EJ-200 plastic scintillator on the TAL and signal intensity was measured. The highest TAL value was determined for samples with 24 mm x 6 mm cross-section.</description>

      <title>Photon number resolving detectors as evidence for the corpuscular nature of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors provide compelling evidence for the discrete nature of light; i.e., whether they indicate the prior presence of a certain number of discrete photons. To answer this question, we reveal the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing PNR detectors, and propose an alternative interpretation for the analysis of PNR detector output that is consistent with a wave picture of light and does not rely on the presumption of light particles. This interpretation is based on the aggregation of correlated or accidentally coincident detections within a given detector coincidence window. Our interpretation accounts for the arbitrary character of detector coincidence windows and includes connections to established treatments of intensity interferometers. To validate our interpretation, we performed an experiment on a multiplexed PNR detector and examined the dependence of photon number on the coincidence window via post-processing. These observations were then compared to a fully classical wave model based on amplitude threshold detection, and the results were found to be in excellent agreement. We find that results from low SNR PNR detectors, such as those existing in the literature, are able to be described by classical descriptions, and therefore do not demonstrate evidence for the discrete nature of light.</description>

      <title>Performance testing of a novel short axis photomultiplier tube for the HUNT project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with large-area cathodes are increasingly being used in cosmic-ray experiments to enhance detection efficiency. The optical modules (OMs) of the High-Energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) have employed a brand new N6205 20-inch microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) developed by the North Night Vision Science &amp; Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT). In order to make the 20-inch PMT fit into the 23-inch diameter pressure-resistant glass sphere, NNVT improved the internal structure of PMT and shortened the height of PMT by more than 10~cm. The first batch of these PMTs has been delivered for preliminary research work. This paper describes a specific PMT testing platform built for the first batch of 15 MCP-PMTs, and some performance parameters of PMT, such as peak-to-valley ratio, TTS and nonliniearity, are measured. The measurement results show that the new PMT still has good performance and can meet the requirements of HUNT project.</description>

      <title>Calibration and simulation of ionization signal and electronics noise in the ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.</description>
