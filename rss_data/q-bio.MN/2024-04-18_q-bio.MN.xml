      <title>A computational scheme connecting gene regulatory network dynamics with heterogeneous stem cell regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stem cell regeneration is a vital biological process in self-renewing tissues, governing development and tissue homeostasis. Gene regulatory network dynamics are pivotal in controlling stem cell regeneration and cell type transitions. However, integrating the quantitative dynamics of gene regulatory networks at the single-cell level with stem cell regeneration at the population level poses significant challenges. This study presents a computational framework connecting gene regulatory network dynamics with stem cell regeneration through a data-driven formulation of the inheritance function. The inheritance function captures epigenetic state transitions during cell division in heterogeneous stem cell populations. Our scheme allows the derivation of the inheritance function based on a hybrid model of cross-cell-cycle gene regulation network dynamics. The proposed scheme enables us to derive the inheritance function based on the hybrid model of cross-cell-cycle gene regulation network dynamics. By explicitly incorporating gene regulatory network structure, it replicates cross-cell-cycling gene regulation dynamics through individual-cell-based modeling. The numerical scheme holds the potential for extension to diverse gene regulatory networks, facilitating a deeper understanding of the connection between gene regulation dynamics and stem cell regeneration.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for non-monotonic dose response, with an application to a kinetic proofreading model -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady state non-monotonic ("biphasic") dose responses are often observed in experimental biology, which raises the control-theoretic question of identifying which possible mechanisms might underlie such behaviors. It is well known that the presence of an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) in a network may give rise to a non-monotonic response. It has been conjectured that this condition is also necessary, i.e. that a non-monotonic response implies the existence of an IFFL. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is false, and in the process prove a weaker version: that either an IFFL must exist or both a positive loop and a negative feedback loop must exist. Towards this aim, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when minors of a symbolic matrix have mixed signs. Finally, we study in full generality when a model of immune T-cell activation could exhibit a steady state non-monotonic dose response.</description>
