      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning with PennyLane: A Comprehensive Guide for Computational Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning represents a frontier in computational research, combining the potential advantages of quantum computing with established classical optimization techniques. PennyLane provides a Python framework that seamlessly bridges quantum circuits and classical machine learning, enabling researchers to build, optimize, and deploy variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces PennyLane as a versatile tool for quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry applications. We demonstrate use cases including quantum kernel methods, variational quantum eigensolvers, portfolio optimization, and integration with classical ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Through concrete Python examples with widely used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, we show how PennyLane facilitates efficient quantum circuit construction, automatic differentiation, and hybrid optimization workflows. By situating PennyLane within the broader context of quantum computing and machine learning, we highlight its role as a methodological building block for quantum-enhanced data science. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that bridges foundational quantum computing concepts and applied machine learning practice, making PennyLane a default citation for hybrid quantum-classical workflows in Python-based research.</description>

      <title>Enabling Predictive Maintenance in District Heating Substations: A Labelled Dataset and Fault Detection Evaluation Framework based on Service Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.
  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.
  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.</description>

      <title>irace-evo: Automatic Algorithm Configuration Extended With LLM-Based Code Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve &amp; Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Generative AI for CS1 Code Grading: Direct vs Reverse Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.
  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.
  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Efficient Large-Scale Log Analysis with LLMs: An IT Software Support Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IT environments typically have logging mechanisms to monitor system health and detect issues. However, the huge volume of generated logs makes manual inspection impractical, highlighting the importance of automated log analysis in IT Software Support. In this paper, we propose a log analytics tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for log data processing and issue diagnosis, enabling the generation of automated insights and summaries. We further present a novel approach for efficiently running LLMs on CPUs to process massive log volumes in minimal time without compromising output quality. We share the insights and lessons learned from deployment of the tool - in production since March 2024 - scaled across 70 software products, processing over 2000 tickets for issue diagnosis, achieving a time savings of 300+ man hours and an estimated $15,444 per month in manpower costs compared to the traditional log analysis practices.</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous Assurance with Formal Verification and Assurance Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to explore the benefits of automatic pipeline provisioning and identify how it can be applied. Automatic pipeline provisioning can be defined as a process of quickly deploying a pipeline for a software engineering project.

      <title>MermaidSeqBench: An Evaluation Benchmark for LLM-to-Mermaid Sequence Diagram Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.</description>

      <title>FRIENDS GUI: A graphical user interface for data collection and visualization of vaping behavior from a passive vaping monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding puffing topography (PT), which includes puff duration, intra puff interval, and puff count per session, is critical for evaluating Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) use, toxicant exposure, and informing regulatory decisions. We developed FRIENDS (Flexible Robust Instrumentation of ENDS), an open-source device that records puffing and touch events of ENDS by attaching to it. This paper introduces the FRIENDS GUI that improves accessibility and interpretability of data collected by FRIENDS. The GUI is a Python-based open-source tool that extracts, decodes, and visualizes 24-hour puffing data from the FRIENDS device. Validation using 24-hour experimental data confirmed accurate timestamp conversion, reliable event decoding, and effective behavioral visualization. The software is freely available on GitHub for public use.</description>

      <title>Effective Code Membership Inference for Code Completion Models via Adversarial Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Finetuning LLMs for Automatic Form Interaction on Web-Browser in Selenium Testing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15168v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.</description>

      <title>From Code Smells to Best Practices: Tackling Resource Leaks in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.</description>

      <title>M, Toolchain and Language for Reusable Model Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.</description>

      <title>A Viable Paradigm of Software Automation: Iterative End-to-End Automated Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software development automation is a long-term goal in software engineering. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development.</description>

Abstract: In software engineering processes for machine learning (ML)-enabled systems, integrating and verifying ML components is a major challenge. A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems.</description>

      <title>MutDafny: A Mutation-Based Approach to Assess Dafny Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.
  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.</description>

      <title>EPSO: A Caching-Based Efficient Superoptimizer for BPF Bytecode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows developers to extend Linux kernel functionality without modifying its source code. To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Guided Test Case Minimization for LLM-Based Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.</description>

      <title>It's LIT! Reliability-Optimized LLMs with Inspectable Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Model-Checking a ROS2 Multi-Robot System using Timed Rebeca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based development enables quicker prototyping, earlier experimentation and validation of design intents. For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.</description>

      <title>Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.</description>

      <title>Tutorial Debriefing: Applied Statistical Causal Inference in Requirements Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As any scientific discipline, the software engineering (SE) research community strives to contribute to the betterment of the target population of our research: software producers and consumers. We will only achieve this betterment if we manage to transfer the knowledge acquired during research into practice. This transferal of knowledge may come in the form of tools, processes, and guidelines for software developers. However, the value of these contributions hinges on the assumption that applying them causes an improvement of the development process, user experience, or other performance metrics. Such a promise requires evidence of causal relationships between an exposure or intervention (i.e., the contributed tool, process or guideline) and an outcome (i.e., performance metrics). A straight-forward approach to obtaining this evidence is via controlled experiments in which a sample of a population is randomly divided into a group exposed to the new tool, process, or guideline, and a control group. However, such randomized control trials may not be legally, ethically, or logistically feasible. In these cases, we need a reliable process for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational data.</description>

      <title>Planning-Aware Code Infilling via Horizon-Length Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM), or infilling, has become integral to code language models, enabling generation of missing code given both left and right contexts. However, the current FIM training paradigm which performs next-token prediction (NTP) over reordered sequence often leads to models struggling to generate content that aligns well with the surrounding context. We hypothesize that NTP alone is insufficient for models to learn effective planning conditioned on the distant right context, a critical factor for successful code infilling. To overcome this, we propose Horizon-Length Prediction (HLP), a novel training objective that teaches models to predict the number of remaining middle tokens at each step. HLP advances FIM with lookahead planning, enabling models to inherently learn infilling boundaries for arbitrary left and right contexts without relying on dataset-specific post-processing. Our evaluation across different model families and sizes shows that HLP significantly improves FIM performance by up to 24% relatively on diverse benchmarks, across file-level and repository-level. Furthermore, the enhanced planning capability gained through HLP boosts model performance on code reasoning. Importantly, HLP incurs negligible training overhead and no additional inference cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Secrets Must Not Flow: Scaling Security Verification to Large Codebases (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security protocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because of the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon* that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data (such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in less than three person months.</description>

      <title>Catalpa: GC for a Low-Variance Software Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of an application/runtime is usually conceptualized as a continuous function where, the lower the amount of memory/time used on a given workload, then the better the compiler/runtime is. However, in practice, good performance of an application is viewed as more of a binary function - either the application responds in under, say 100 ms, and provides a good user experience, or it takes a noticeable amount of time, leaving the user waiting and potentially abandoning the task. Thus, performance really means how often the application is fast enough to meet user expectations, leading industrial developers to focus on the 95th and 99th percentile tail-latencies as heavily, or moreso, than average response time. Our vision is to create a software stack that actively supports these needs via programming language and runtime system design. In this paper we present a novel garbage-collector design, the Catalpa collector, for the Bosque programming language and runtime. This allocator is designed to minimize latency and tail-latency variability while maintaining high-throughput and incurring small memory overheads. To achieve these goals we leverage various features of the Bosque language, including immutability and reference-cycle freedom, to construct a collector that has provably bounded collection pauses, incurs a fixed-constant memory overhead, and ensures starvation freedom for the application!</description>
