      <title>Sub-critical athermal flow in disordered materials caused by periodic variations of environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yield stress materials deform irreversibly at a finite strain-rate if loaded with a fixed stress $\sigma$ larger than some critical yield stress $\sigma_c$. When $\sigma&lt;\sigma_c$ deformation is only transient, unless thermal activation plays a role, in which case persistent deformation occurs as a creep activated process. Yet in subcritical athermal conditions we observe that cyclic time variation of system parameters can induce a steady-state flow, with a total deformation that scales linearly with the number of cycles applied. We characterize this phenomenon using well established models in the fields of depinning and yielding transitions. Interestingly, there is an endurance limit $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ for this process to occur, below which the advance is totally suppressed. We discuss implications of our findings to the study of sub-critical evolution of landforms in which periodic variations of external conditions (as for instance daily/seasonal cycles of temperature, humidity, etc.) are expected.</description>

      <title>Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in one-dimensional exactly solvable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of exactly solvable flat-band quasiperiodic lattice models that encompass a variety of multifractal-enriched mobility edges and multi-state coexisting quantum phases. Utilizing Avila's global theory, we derive exact expressions of the Lyapunov exponents in both lattice and dual spaces, providing an analytical expression and phase diagram for the multifractal-enriched mobility edges. Additionally, we numerically compute the inverse participation ratios of the eigenstates in both real and dual spaces to further characterize these phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models can be realized using Rydberg atomic arrays, enabling the observation of Lyapunov exponents and inverse participation ratios through a powerful spectroscopy approach.</description>

      <title>Mean-squared Energy Difference for Exploring Potential Energy Landscapes of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By extending the concept of diffusion to the potential energy landscapes (PELs), we introduce the mean-squared energy difference (MSED) as a novel quantity to investigate the intrinsic properties of glass. MSED can provide a clear description of the "energy relaxation" process on a PEL. Through MSED analysis, we can obtain characteristic timescale similar to those from structure analysis, namely $\tau_\alpha^*$. We establish a connection between MSED and the properties of PELs, providing a concise and quantitative description of the PEL. We find that the roughness of the accessible PEL has changed significantly after the glass transition. And we also find that one of the PEL parameters is closely related to the Adam-Gibbs configurational entropy. The present research, which directly links the PEL to the relaxation process, provides avenues for further research of the glass.</description>

      <title>Some observations on the ambivalent role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect in this note some observations on the role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems, that can be useful or detrimental depending on the way they act on the signal and on the observations. We emphasize in particular the need to gauge away unobservable invariances in the definition of a distance between a signal and its estimator, and the consequences this implies for the statistical mechanics treatment of such models, taking as a motivating example the extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Problem hardness of diluted Ising models: Population Annealing vs Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.</description>

      <title>In-situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of Darcy's law of yield stress fluids on a deep tree-like network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the flow dynamics of yield stress fluids in porous media presents a substantial challenge. Both experiments and extensive numerical simulations frequently show a non-linear relationship between the flow rate and the pressure gradient, deviating from the traditional Darcy law. In this article, we consider a tree-like porous structure and utilize an exact mapping with the directed polymer (DP) with disordered bond energies on the Cayley tree. Specifically, we adapt an algorithm recently introduced by Brunet et al. [Europhys. Lett. 131, 40002 (2020)] to simulate exactly the tip region of branching random walks with the help of a spinal decomposition, to accurately compute the flow on extensive trees with several thousand generations. Our results confirm the asymptotic predictions proposed by Schimmenti et al. [Phys. Rev. E 108, L023102 (2023)], tested therein only for moderate trees of about 20 generations.</description>

      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remain (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0002 $ (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Block Hypergraph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is widely used to generate graphs with a community structure, but no simple alternative currently exists for hypergraphs, in which more than two nodes can be connected together through a hyperedge. We discuss here such a hypergraph generalization, based on the clustering connection probability $P_{ij}$ between nodes of communities $i$ and $j$, and that uses an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process. We focus on the standard case where $P_{ij}=p\delta_{ij}+q(1-\delta_{ij})$ when $0\leq q\leq p$. We propose a simple model that satisfies three criteria: it should be as simple as possible, when $p = q$ the model should be equivalent to the standard hypergraph random model, and it should use an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process so that the model is intuitive and can easily express different real-world formation processes. We first show that for such a model the degree distribution and hyperedge size distribution can be approximated by binomial distributions with effective parameters that depend on the number of communities and $q/p$. Also, the composition of hyperedges goes for $q=0$ from `pure' hyperedges (comprising nodes belonging to the same community) to `mixed' hyperedges that comprise nodes from different communities for $q=p$. We test various formation processes and our results suggest that when they depend on the composition of the hyperedge, they tend to favor the dominant community and lead to hyperedges with a smaller diversity. In contrast, for formation processes that are independent from the hyperedge structure, we obtain hyperedges comprising a larger diversity of communities. The advantages of the model proposed here are its simplicity and flexibility that make it a good candidate for testing community-related problems, such as their detection, impact on various dynamics, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>
