      <title>Predissociation dynamics of the hydroxyl radical (OH) based on a five-state spectroscopic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) potential energy curves (PECs) and spin-orbit couplings for the X $^2\Pi$, A $^2 \Sigma^+$, 1 $^2 \Sigma^-$, 1 $^4 \Sigma^-$, and 1 $^4 \Pi$ states of OH are computed and refined against empirical energy levels and transitions to produce a spectroscopic model. Predissociation lifetimes are determined by discretising continuum states in the variational method nuclear motion calculation by restricting the calculation to finite range of internuclear separations. Varying this range give a series of avoided crossings between quasi-bound states associated with the A $^2 \Sigma^+$ and continuum states, from which predissociation lifetimes are extracted. 424 quasi-bound A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state rovibronic energy levels are analysed and 374 predissociation lifetimes are produced, offering good coverage of the predissociation region. Agreement with measured lifetimes is satisfactory and a majority of computed results were within experimental uncertainty. A previously unreported A $^2 \Sigma^+$ state predissociation channel which goes via the X $^2\Pi$ is identified in the calculations. A python package, binslt, is produced to calculate predissociation lifetimes, associated line broadening parameters, and uncertainties from Duo *.states files is made available. The PECs and other curves from this work will be used to produce a rovibronic ExoMol linelist and temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections for the hydroxyl radical.</description>

      <title>Expanding Chemical Representation with k-mers and Fragment-based Fingerprints for Molecular Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach, combining substruct counting, $k$-mers, and Daylight-like fingerprints, to expand the representation of chemical structures in SMILES strings. The integrated method generates comprehensive molecular embeddings that enhance discriminative power and information content. Experimental evaluations demonstrate its superiority over traditional Morgan fingerprinting, MACCS, and Daylight fingerprint alone, improving chemoinformatics tasks such as drug classification. The proposed method offers a more informative representation of chemical structures, advancing molecular similarity analysis and facilitating applications in molecular design and drug discovery. It presents a promising avenue for molecular structure analysis and design, with significant potential for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>A microstructure-sensitive electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model of pitting and stress corrosion cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field formulation is developed to simulate pitting and stress corrosion in polycrystalline materials. The formulation incorporates dependencies of mechanical properties and corrosion potential on crystallographic orientation. The model considers the formation and charging dynamics of an electric double layer through a new general boundary condition for the solution potential. The potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating corrosion in polycrystalline materials with various grain morphology distributions. The results show that incorporating the underlying microstructure yields more extensive defects, faster defect kinetics, and irregular pit and crack shapes relative to a microstructurally-insensitive homogeneous material scenario.</description>

      <title>Interoperable Workflows by Exchanging Grid-Based Data between Quantum-Chemical Program Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-chemical subsystem and embedding methods require complex workflows that may involve multiple quantum-chemical program packages. Moreover, such workflows require the exchange of voluminous data that goes beyond simple quantities such as molecular structures and energies. Here, we describe our approach for addressing this interoperability challenge by exchanging electron densities and embedding potentials as grid-based data. We describe the approach that we have implemented to this end in a dedicated code, PyEmbed, currently part of a Python scripting framework. We discuss how it has facilitated the development of quantum-chemical subsystem and embedding methods, and highlight several applications that have been enabled by PyEmbed, including WFT-in-DFT embedding schemes mixing non-relativistic and relativistic electronic structure methods, real-time time-dependent DFT-in-DFT approaches, the density-based many-body expansion, and workflows including real-space data analysis and visualization. Our approach demonstrates in particular the merits of exchanging (complex) grid-based data, and in general the potential of modular software development in quantum chemistry, which hinges upon libraries that facilitate interoperability.</description>

      <title>The M{\o}ller-Plesset Adiabatic Connection at Large Coupling Strengths for Open-shell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the adiabatic connection that has as weak-coupling expansion the M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation series, generalizing to the open-shell case previous closed-shell results for the large-coupling limit. We first focus on the hydrogen atom with fractional spins, providing results along the adiabatic connection, from small to large coupling strengths. We reveal an intriguing phase diagram, and an equation for the large-coupling leading order that has closed-form solutions for specific choices of its relevant quantum numbers. We then show that the hydrogen atom results provide variational estimates for the large-coupling leading terms for the general many-electron open-shell case in terms of functionals of the Hartree-Fock {\alpha}-spin and {\beta}-spin densities.</description>

      <title>Diatomic molecules of alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal atoms: interaction potentials, dipole moments, and polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold diatomic molecules find application in quantum studies ranging from controlled chemistry and precision measurement physics to quantum many-body simulation and potentially quantum computing. Accurate knowledge of molecular properties is required to guide and explain ongoing experiments. Here, in an extensive and comparative study, we theoretically investigate the electronic properties of the ground-state diatomic molecules composed of alkali-metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and alkaline-earth-metal (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra) atoms. We study 78 hetero- and homonuclear diatomic combinations, including 21 alkali-metal molecules in the $X^1\Sigma^+$ and $a^3\Sigma^+$ electronic states, 36 alkali-metal--alkaline-earth-metal molecules in the $X^2\Sigma^+$ electronic state, and 21 alkaline-earth-metal molecules in the $X^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state. We calculate potential energy curves, permanent electric dipole moments, and polarizabilities using the hierarchy of coupled cluster methods upto CCSDTQ with large Gaussian basis sets and small-core relativistic energy-consistent pseudopotentials. We collect and analyze corresponding spectroscopic constants. We estimate computational uncertainties and compare the present values with previous experimental and theoretical data to establish a new theoretical benchmark. The presented results should be useful for further application of the studied molecules in modern ultracold physics and chemistry experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Local Structures In Critical Supercooled Water Through Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of a second critical point in water has been a topic of intense investigation for the last few decades. The molecular origins underlying this phenomenon are typically rationalized in terms of the competition between local high-density (HD) and low-density (LD) structures. Their identification often require designing parameters that are subject to human intervention. Herein, we use unsupervised learning to discover structures in atomistic simulations of water close to the Liquid-Liquid Critical point (LLCP). Encoding the information of the environment using local descriptors, we do not find evidence for two distinct thermodynamic structures. In contrast, when we deploy non-local descriptors that probe instead heterogeneities on the nanometer length scale, this leads to the emergence of LD and HD domains rationalizing the microscopic origins of the density fluctuations close to criticality.</description>
