      <title>Mechanical Evidence of the impossibility of directed motion of Trypanosoma cruzi towards preferred organs in the Human Body, a simulation 2D model within a laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of the infective form of the T. Cruzi parasite within the human blood is not completely understood. Video microscopy observations confirm forward motility of the protozoa and relate it to the deformation of the body, nonetheless there are open questions relating the deformation of the protozoan with its motion in blood, for which a computational model would be very helpful. Hereby we introduce a simple computational 2D model to test whether it is mechanistically possible for the parasite to direct its movement through the blood stream towards preferred organs in the bloodstream.
  We model the infective form of the T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease; by means of a network of harmonic springs that represents its body, without explicitly modeling the flagellum. We coupled this with a particle model of a laminar fluid flow, which we implemented using the Dissipative Particles Dynamics method.
  Our parasite model swims on still fluid, its center of mass displacement being larger than the end to end deformation. Laminar flow dragged the model parasite of the order of 5 $\mu m$; having minor effects on its structure.
  The parasite model does not exhibit directed motion in a moving fluid, suggesting that the large-scale displacement of the real parasite is not attributable to its own motility but is instead caused by it being dragged by the flow. We highlight two potential improvements for the model: incorporating the capacity to describe 3D motion and including a specific depiction of the flagellum.</description>

      <title>Kramers rate for Brownian particles in excitable media with deformable double-well substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the Kramers escape problem for Brownian particles in bistable substrates with deformable double-well shapes. The shape deformability is considered of three distinct forms: in one, the positions of the two degenerate minima can be shifted continuously without affecting the barrier height. In the second the minima positions are kept fix while the barrier height is continuously shifted. In the third the minima positions and barrier height can be tuned simultaneously by changing a single real parameter that we refer to as deformability parameter. We obtain the analytical expression of the Kramers escape rate for the three different double-well models, and identify a critical value of the deformability parameter above which non-Gaussian corrections become relevant. Remarkable enough in the latter region, statistical mechanics predicts a first-order transition in quantum tunneling using the functional action associated with the family of deformable double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Cell Competition Driven by Secreted Ligands: Modeling Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell competition in multicellular organisms has been shown to play a critical role during the development of organisms, cancer progression, and in the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Various mechanisms of cell competition have been identified, including active elimination via mechanical forces or induced apoptosis, as well as competition for nutrients and other beneficial factors. A recent experiment demonstrated hallmarks of cell competition, associated with cell cycle dynamics, between liver progenitor cells and colorectal cancer cells [Krotenberg Garcia et al., iScience 27, 109718 (2024)]. However, a mechanistic explanation for this form of competition remains lacking. Here, we present a mean-field model of competition for signaling ligands, coupled with cell cycle dynamics, to provide such an understanding. Our model captures the salient features of the experiment, including population dynamics and cell cycle variations. We demonstrate that secretion of a beneficial factor by cells, coupled with the enhanced uptake efficiency of cancer cells, suffices to reproduce the experimental outcome. Our model, reminiscent of competition for secreted growth factors, provides insight into the minimal level of complexity required to achieve the observed competitive outcome as well as its link to cell cycle dynamics. It can also serve as a general framework for studying biological populations with growth-stage-dependent competition over consumer-produced products.</description>

      <title>Tracking phase synchronization between flagella in the time-frequency domain resolves photophobic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CR) is well known for its bi-flagellated swimming in response to light stimuli. This work aims to study the resynchronization of CR flagella after a high light intensity stimulus, known as photoshock. The synchronization is estimated thanks to a quantity defined as the Phase Synchronization Index (PSI). The originality of this approach is to perform a time-frequency computation of a complex PSI based on continuous wavelet transform. Thanks to this analysis, we distinguish three swimming stages involving different frequency bands and phase shifts: normal breaststroke, escaping, and resynchronization. This approach also reveals the presence of signal harmonics that set the photoshock response, independently of cell variability. Our results suggest that CR modulates the balance between fundamental and harmonic beating modes, providing a mechanism for robust adaptation to sudden environmental stresses.</description>

      <title>Spatial self-organization of enzymes in complex reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems contain intricate biochemical networks whose structure is closely related to their function and allows them to exhibit robust behavior in the presence of external stimuli. Such networks typically involve catalytic enzymes, which can have non-trivial transport properties, in particular chemotaxis-like directed motion along gradients of substrates and products. Here, we find that taking into account enzyme chemotaxis in models of catalyzed reaction networks can lead to their spatial self-organization in a process similar to biomolecular condensate formation. We develop a general theory for arbitrary reaction networks, and systematically study all closed unimolecular reaction networks involving up to six chemicals. Importantly, we find that network-wide propagation of concentration perturbations can be key to enabling self-organization. The ability to self-organize is highly dependent on the relative signs of the chemotactic mobilities of the enzymes to their substrate and product and on the global network structure. We find that spontaneous self-organization through chemotaxis can provide an avenue for the self-regulation of metabolic activity in complex catalyzed reaction networks. The network-induced interaction mechanism we uncover operates in the regime where the substrate molecules are diffusion-limited, suggesting that signaling molecules could take advantage of this scenario towards their functionality.</description>

      <title>Probing and modeling cell-cell communication in 2D biomimetic tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In tissues, cells in direct physical contact with each other can exchange ions or molecules via protein clusters called gap junctions that form channels across the membranes of adjacent cells. Here, we use a simplified biomimetic approach, coupled with theoretical modeling, to unravel the physical mechanisms controlling such transport. Tissues are mimicked with 2D hexagonal networks of monodisperse aqueous droplets connected by lipid membranes called Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs), decorated with $\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) transmembrane proteins forming nanopores through heptamerization in the membrane. The diffusion of calcein across 2D DIB networks is thoroughly studied using epifluorescence microscopy at various $\alpha$HL concentrations. The results are successfully confronted with a Continuous Time Random Walk model in hexagonal networks, with an average waiting time increasing nonlinearly with the concentration of pore monomers.</description>

      <title>Swimming patterns of a multi-mode bacterial swimmer in fluid shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial swimming is well characterized in uniform liquids at rest. The natural habitat of bacterial swimmers, however, is often dominated by moving fluids and interfaces, resulting in shear flows that may strongly alter bacterial navigation strategies. Here, we study how fluid shear flow affects the swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, a bacterial swimmer that moves in a versatile pattern composed of three different swimming modes, where the flagella may push, pull, or wrap around the cell body (multi-mode swimmer). We introduce a computer automated cell tracking and swimming mode detection tool to show that shear induced alignment depends on the swimming mode, while motility and proximity to surfaces counteract the alignment effect. Moreover, filament wrapping becomes less efficient with increasing shear stress. Numerical simulations of realistic swimmer geometries complement our experimental results, providing more detailed mechanistic insights into movement patterns of bacterial swimmers in a shear flow.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of emulsions with matter supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a theory for the kinetics of emulsions in which a continuous supply of matter feeds droplet growth. We consider cases where growth is either limited by bulk diffusion or the transport through the droplets' interfaces. Our theory extends the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory by two types of matter supply, where either the supersaturation is maintained or the supply rate is constant. In emulsions with maintained supersaturation, we find a decoupling of droplets at all times, with the droplet size distribution narrowing in the diffusion-limited regime and a drifting distribution of a fixed shape in the interface-resistance-limited case. In emulsions with a constant matter supply, there is a transition between narrowing and broadening in the diffusion-limited regime, and the distribution is non-universal. For the interface-resistance-limited regime, there is no transition to narrowing, and we find a universal law governing coarsening kinetics that is valid for any constant matter supply. The average radius evolves according to a power law that is independent of the matter supply, and we find a closed-form expression for the droplet size distribution function. Our theory is relevant to biological systems, such as biomolecular condensates in living cells, since droplet material is not conserved and the growth of small droplets is proposed to be interface-resistance-limited.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. Specifically, longer chains show lower error rates, significantly distinct from the chain-growth polymerization where errors typically accumulate with chain length. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Slow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that synaptic weights in the brain follow heavy-tailed distributions, yet most theoretical analyses of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) assume Gaussian connectivity. We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable -- implying ubiquitous chaos -- our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader parameter regime near the edge of chaos, namely a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks -- where mean-field theory breaks down -- we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Multivalent linkers mediated ultra-sensitive bio-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>
