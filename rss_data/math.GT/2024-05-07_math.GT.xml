      <title>Immersions of 3-manifolds into the 5-space, almost contact structures, and complex tangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wu invariant is a regular homotopy invariant for immersions of oriented 3-manifolds into the 5-space. In this paper, we present new expressions and vanishing theorems for the invariant, from the viewpoint of almost contact structures and complex tangents. As an application, we determine the regular homotopy classes of inclusion maps of the surface singularity links of type ADE into the 5-sphere.</description>

      <title>On Manolescu's $\kappa$-invariants of rational homology 3-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an estimate for Manolescu's $\kappa$-invariant of a rational homology 3-sphere $Y$ by the data of a spin 4-orbifold bounded by $Y$. By an appropriate choice of a 4-orbifold, sometimes we can restrict and determine the value of $\kappa$. We give such examples in case of Dehn surgeries along knots in $S^3$.</description>

      <title>Morse properties in convex projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of "hyperbolic directions" in groups acting cocompactly on properly convex domains in real projective space, from three different perspectives simultaneously: the (coarse) metric geometry of the Hilbert metric, the projective geometry of the boundary of the domain, and the singular value gaps of projective automorphisms. We describe the relationship between different definitions of "Morse" and "regular" quasi-geodesics arising in these three different contexts. This generalizes several results of Benoist and Guichard to the non-Gromov hyperbolic setting.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Connecting essential triangulations I: via 2-3 and 0-2 moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $M$ is a compact, connected three-manifold with boundary. We show that if the universal cover has infinitely many boundary components then $M$ has an ideal triangulation which is essential: no edge can be homotoped into the boundary. Under the same hypotheses, we show that the set of essential triangulations of $M$ is connected via 2-3, 3-2, 0-2, and 2-0 moves.
  The above results are special cases of our general theory. We introduce $L$-essential triangulations: boundary components of the universal cover receive labels and no edge has the same label at both ends. As an application, under mild conditions on a representation, we construct an ideal triangulation for which a solution to Thurston's gluing equations recovers the given representation.
  Our results also imply that such triangulations are connected via 2-3, 3-2, 0-2, and 2-0 moves. Together with results of Pandey and Wong, this proves that Dimofte and Garoufalidis' 1-loop invariant is independent of the choice of essential triangulation.</description>

      <title>A topological model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first known topological model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. More precisely, we prove that this invariant is given by a set of graded intersections between explicit Lagrangian submanifolds in a fixed configuration space on a Heegaard surface for the link exterior. The submanifolds are supported on arcs and ovals on the surface.
  The construction also leads to a topological model for the Jones polynomial constructed from Heegaard surfaces associated directly to the link diagram. In particular, it does not rely on a choice of a braid representative for the link. This opens up new avenues for investigation of the geometry of these invariants, as well as categorifications of geometric nature.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing 2-knots admitting circle actions by fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere invariant under a circle action is called a branched twist spin. A branched twist spin is constructed from a 1-knot in the 3-sphere and a pair of coprime integers uniquely. In this paper, we study, for each pair of coprime integers, if two different 1-knots yield the same branched twist spin, and prove that such a pair of 1-knots does not exist in most cases. Fundamental groups of 3-orbifolds of cyclic type are obtained as quotient groups of the fundamental groups of the complements of branched twist spins. We use these groups for distinguishing branched twist spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $d\geq4$ we construct explicit classes in homotopy groups of spaces of embeddings of either an arc or a circle into $M$, in every degree that is a multiple of $d-3$, and show that they are detected in the Taylor tower of Goodwillie and Weiss. The classes are obtained from families of string links constructed in the $d$-ball.</description>

      <title>Obstruction Complexes in Grid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. In doing so, they produced an obstruction chain complex of the grid diagram with that square removed. We define the obstruction chain complex of the full grid, without the square removed, and compute its homology. Though this homology is too complicated to immediately extend the Manolescu-Sarkar construction, we give results about the existence of sign assignments in grid homology.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma)&lt;\mathcal{A} &lt; C(X)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A}=C(Y)\rtimes_{r}\Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu)\rtimes\Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>
