      <title>Rumor Mitigation in Social Media Platforms with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become one of the main channels where people disseminate and acquire information, of which the reliability is severely threatened by rumors widespread in the network. Existing approaches such as suspending users or broadcasting real information to combat rumors are either with high cost or disturbing users. In this paper, we introduce a novel rumor mitigation paradigm, where only a minimal set of links in the social network are intervened to decelerate the propagation of rumors, countering misinformation with low business cost and user awareness. A knowledge-informed agent embodying rumor propagation mechanisms is developed, which intervenes the social network with a graph neural network for capturing information flow in the social media platforms and a policy network for selecting links. Experiments on real social media platforms demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate the influence of rumors, substantially reducing the affected populations by over 25%.

      <title>Gun Culture in Fringe Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of mass shootings in the United States has, unfortunately, become a norm. While the issue of gun control in the US involves complex legal concerns, there are also societal issues at play. One such social issue is so-called "gun culture," i.e., a general set of beliefs and actions related to gun ownership. However relatively little is known about gun culture, and even less is known when it comes to fringe online communities. This is especially worrying considering the aforementioned rise in mass shootings and numerous instances of shooters being radicalized online.
  To address this gap, we explore gun culture on /k/, 4chan's weapons board. More specifically, using a variety of quantitative techniques, we examine over 4M posts on /k/ and position their discussion within the larger body of theoretical understanding of gun culture. Among other things, our findings suggest that gun culture on /k/ covers a relatively diverse set of topics (with a particular focus on legal discussion), some of which are signals of fetishism.</description>

      <title>Belief and Persuasion in Scientific Discourse on Social Media: A Study of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research into COVID-19 has been rapidly evolving since the onset of the pandemic. This occasionally results in contradictory recommendations by credible sources of scientific opinion, public health authorities, and medical professionals. In this study, we examine whether this has resulted in a lack of trust in scientific opinion, by examining the belief patterns of social media users and their reactions to statements related to scientific facts. We devise models to mine belief and persuasion in Twitter discourse using semi-supervised approaches, and show the relationship between lack of belief and insurgence of paranoia and conspiracy theories. By investigating these belief patterns, we explore the best persuasion tactics for communicating information related to COVID-19.</description>

      <title>From Pro, Anti to Informative and Hesitant: An Infoveillance study of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination discourse on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the world, and vaccination has been a key strategy to combat the disease. Since Twitter is one of the most widely used public microblogging platforms, researchers have analysed COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination Twitter discourse to explore the conversational dynamics around the topic. While contributing to the crisis informatics literature, we curate a large-scale geotagged Twitter dataset, GeoCovaxTweets Extended, and explore the discourse through multiple spatiotemporal analyses. This dataset covers a longer time span of 38 months, from the announcement of the first vaccine to the availability of booster doses. Results show that 43.4% of the collected tweets, although containing phrases and keywords related to vaccines and vaccinations, were unrelated to the COVID-19 context. In total, 23.1% of the discussions on vaccines and vaccinations were classified as Pro, 16% as Hesitant, 11.4% as Anti, and 6.1% as Informative. The trend shifted towards Pro and Informative tweets globally as vaccination programs progressed, indicating a change in the public's perception of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination. Furthermore, we explored the discourse based on account attributes, i.e., followers counts and tweet counts. Results show a significant pattern of discourse differences. Our findings highlight the potential of harnessing a large-scale geotagged Twitter dataset to understand global public health communication and to inform targeted interventions aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy.</description>

      <title>From Skepticism to Acceptance: Simulating the Attitude Dynamics Toward Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital era, the rapid propagation of fake news and rumors via social networks brings notable societal challenges and impacts public opinion regulation. Traditional fake news modeling typically forecasts the general popularity trends of different groups or numerically represents opinions shift. However, these methods often oversimplify real-world complexities and overlook the rich semantic information of news text. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides the possibility of modeling subtle dynamics of opinion. Consequently, in this work, we introduce a Fake news Propagation Simulation framework (FPS) based on LLM, which studies the trends and control of fake news propagation in detail. Specifically, each agent in the simulation represents an individual with a distinct personality. They are equipped with both short-term and long-term memory, as well as a reflective mechanism to mimic human-like thinking. Every day, they engage in random opinion exchanges, reflect on their thinking, and update their opinions. Our simulation results uncover patterns in fake news propagation related to topic relevance, and individual traits, aligning with real-world observations. Additionally, we evaluate various intervention strategies and demonstrate that early and appropriately frequent interventions strike a balance between governance cost and effectiveness, offering valuable insights for practical applications. Our study underscores the significant utility and potential of LLMs in combating fake news.</description>

      <title>Diet-ODIN: A Novel Framework for Opioid Misuse Detection with Interpretable Dietary Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opioid crisis has been one of the most critical society concerns in the United States. Although the medication assisted treatment (MAT) is recognized as the most effective treatment for opioid misuse and addiction, the various side effects can trigger opioid relapse. In addition to MAT, the dietary nutrition intervention has been demonstrated its importance in opioid misuse prevention and recovery. However, research on the alarming connections between dietary patterns and opioid misuse remain under-explored. In response to this gap, in this paper, we first establish a large-scale multifaceted dietary benchmark dataset related to opioid users at the first attempt and then develop a novel framework - i.e., namely Opioid Misuse Detection with Interpretable Dietary Patterns (Diet-ODIN) - to bridge heterogeneous graph (HG) and large language model (LLM) for the identification of users with opioid misuse and the interpretation of their associated dietary patterns. Specifically, in Diet-ODIN, we first construct an HG to comprehensively incorporate both dietary and health-related information, and then we devise a holistic graph learning framework with noise reduction to fully capitalize both users' individual dietary habits and shared dietary patterns for the detection of users with opioid misuse. To further delve into the intricate correlations between dietary patterns and opioid misuse, we exploit an LLM by utilizing the knowledge obtained from the graph learning model for interpretation. The extensive experimental results based on our established benchmark with quantitative and qualitative measures demonstrate the outstanding performance of Diet-ODIN in exploring the complex interplay between opioid misuse and dietary patterns, by comparison with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Biases in Collective Decision-Making: Enhancing Performance in the Face of Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual and social biases undermine the effectiveness of human advisers by inducing judgment errors which can disadvantage protected groups. In this paper, we study the influence these biases can have in the pervasive problem of fake news by evaluating human participants' capacity to identify false headlines. By focusing on headlines involving sensitive characteristics, we gather a comprehensive dataset to explore how human responses are shaped by their biases. Our analysis reveals recurring individual biases and their permeation into collective decisions. We show that demographic factors, headline categories, and the manner in which information is presented significantly influence errors in human judgment. We then use our collected data as a benchmark problem on which we evaluate the efficacy of adaptive aggregation algorithms. In addition to their improved accuracy, our results highlight the interactions between the emergence of collective intelligence and the mitigation of participant biases.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport distances for directed, weighted graphs: a case study with cell-cell communication networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing graphs by means of optimal transport has recently gained significant attention, as the distances induced by optimal transport provide both a principled metric between graphs as well as an interpretable description of the associated changes between graphs in terms of a transport plan. As the lack of symmetry introduces challenges in the typically considered formulations, optimal transport distances for graphs have mostly been developed for undirected graphs. Here, we propose two distance measures to compare directed graphs based on variants of optimal transport: (i) an earth movers distance (Wasserstein) and (ii) a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. We evaluate these two distances and discuss their relative performance for both simulated graph data and real-world directed cell-cell communication graphs, inferred from single-cell RNA-seq data.</description>

      <title>Which Modality should I use -- Text, Motif, or Image? : Understanding Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research integrates graph data with Large Language Models (LLMs), which, despite their advancements in various fields using large text corpora, face limitations in encoding entire graphs due to context size constraints. This paper introduces a new approach to encoding a graph with diverse modalities, such as text, image, and motif, coupled with prompts to approximate a graph's global connectivity, thereby enhancing LLMs' efficiency in processing complex graph structures. The study also presents GraphTMI, a novel benchmark for evaluating LLMs in graph structure analysis, focusing on homophily, motif presence, and graph difficulty. Key findings indicate that the image modality, especially with vision-language models like GPT-4V, is superior to text in balancing token limits and preserving essential information and outperforms prior graph neural net (GNN) encoders. Furthermore, the research assesses how various factors affect the performance of each encoding modality and outlines the existing challenges and potential future developments for LLMs in graph understanding and reasoning tasks. All data will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Regional inflation analysis using social network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators that have a great impact on the population of any country and region. Inflation is influenced by range of factors, one of which is inflation expectations. Many central banks take this factor into consideration while implementing monetary policy within the inflation targeting regime. Nowadays, a lot of people are active users of the Internet, especially social networks. There is a hypothesis that people search, read, and discuss mainly only those issues that are of particular interest to them. It is logical to assume that the dynamics of prices may also be in the focus of user discussions. So, such discussions could be regarded as an alternative source of more rapid information about inflation expectations. This study is based on unstructured data from Vkontakte social network to analyze upward and downward inflationary trends (on the example of the Omsk region). The sample of more than 8.5 million posts was collected between January 2010 and May 2022. The authors used BERT neural networks to solve the problem. These models demonstrated better results than the benchmarks (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree classifier, etc.). It makes possible to define pro-inflationary and disinflationary types of keywords in different contexts and get their visualization with SHAP method. This analysis provides additional operational information about inflationary processes at the regional level The proposed approach can be scaled for other regions. At the same time the limitation of the work is the time and power costs for the initial training of similar models for all regions of Russia.</description>

      <title>Criminal organizations exhibit hysteresis, resilience, and robustness by balancing security and efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between criminal organizations and law enforcement disruption strategies is crucial in criminology. Criminal enterprises, like legitimate businesses, balance visibility and security to thrive. This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions. We find strong hysteresis effects, challenging traditional deterrence-focused strategies. Optimal thresholds for organization formation or dissolution are defined by these effects. Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability. These insights advocate for adaptive policy-making and strategic law enforcement to effectively disrupt criminal networks.</description>
