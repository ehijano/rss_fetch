      <title>Rotation quenches in trapped bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.</description>

      <title>Polarons and bipolarons in Rydberg-dressed extended Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities immersed in hard-core Bose gases offer exciting opportunities to explore polaron and bipolaron physics. We investigate the ground state properties of a single and a pair of impurities throughout the superfluid and insulating (charge density wave) phases of the bosonic environment. In the superfluid phase, we demonstrate that the impurity undergoes a polaron-like transition, shifting from behaving as an individual particle to becoming a dressed quasiparticle as the coupling with the bath increases. However, in the insulating phase, the impurity can maintain its individual character, moving through a potential landscape shaped by the charge density wave order. Moreover, we show that two impurities can form a bound state even in the absence of an explicit impurity-impurity coupling. Furthermore, we establish the stability of this bound state within both the superfluid and insulating phases. Our results offer valuable insights for ongoing lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Quench Dynamics in an Optical Lattice: sine-Gordon and Bose-Hubbard Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional interacting bosons in an optical lattice after a sudden quench in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) and sine-Gordon (SG) regimes. While in higher dimension, the Mott-superfluid phase transition is observed for weakly interacting bosons in deep lattices, in 1D an instability is generated also for shallow lattices with a commensurate periodic potential pinning the atoms to the Mott state through a transition described by the SG model. The present work aims at identifying the SG and BH regimes. We study them by dynamical measures of several key quantities. We numerically exactly solve the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for small number of atoms and investigate the corresponding quantum many-body dynamics. In both cases, correlation dynamics exhibits collapse revival phenomena, though with different time scales. We argue that the dynamical fragmentation is a convenient quantity to distinguish the dynamics specially near the pinning zone. To understand the relaxation process we measure the many-body information entropy. BH dynamics clearly establishes the possible relaxation to the maximum entropy state determined by the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices (GOE). In contrast, the SG dynamics is so fast that it does not exhibit any signature of relaxation in the present time scale of computation.</description>

      <title>Double-target BEC atomtronic rotation sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept design for an atomtronic rotation sensor consisting of an array of ``double-target'' Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). A ``target'' BEC is a disk-shaped condensate surrounded by a concentric ring-shaped condensate. A ``double-target'' BEC is two adjacent target BECs whose ring condensates partially overlap. The sensor consists of an $n\times m$ array of these double-target BECs. The measurement of the frame rotation speed, $\Omega_{R}$, is carried out by creating the array of double-target BECs (setup step), inducing one unit of quantized flow in the top ring of each member of the array (initialization step), applying potential barriers in the overlap region of each member (measurement step), and observing whether the induced flow is transferred from the top to the bottom ring in each member (readout step). We describe a set of simulations showing that a single instance of a double-target BEC behaves in a way that enables the efficient operation of an $n\times m$ array for measuring $\Omega_{R}$. As an example of sensor operation we present a simulation showing that a 2$\times$2 array can be designed to measure $\Omega_{R}$ in a user-specified range.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ponderomotive Potential for Realizing $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ Bosonic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Ro-vibrational Dynamics of the Neon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short intense laser pulses are routinely used to induce rotational wave packet dynamics of molecules. Ro-vibrational wave packet dynamics has been explored comparatively infrequently, focusing predominantly on extremely light and rigid molecules such as H$_2^+$, H$_2$, and D$_2$. This work presents quantum mechanical calculations that account for the rotational {\em{and}} the vibrational degrees of freedom for a heavier and rather floppy diatomic molecule, namely the neon dimer. For pumping by a strong and short non-resonant pump pulse, we identify several phenomena that depend critically on the vibrational (i.e., radial) degree of freedom. Our calculations show (i) fingerprints of the radial dynamics in the alignment signal; (ii) laser-kick induced dissociative dynamics on very short time scales (ejection of highly structured "jets"); and (iii) tunneling dynamics that signifies the existence of resonance states, which are supported by the effective potential curves for selected finite relative angular momenta. Our theory predictions can be explored by existing state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state of composite bosonic trions, where paired fermions further pair with bosons, in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi system featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction and pair hopping of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that the quasi-condensation of the composite trions is established by algebraic decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed correlations of fermion pairs. Negative binding energy also indicates a strong tendency to form trions. Furthermore, we conduct a phenomenological analysis based on a mean-field variational ansatz to interpret the emergence of composite trions. Additionally, We discuss feasible experimental methods for realizing this novel phase of matter in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality in Degenerate Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the multicomponent Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation describes the low-energy theory for phase fluctuations in a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ degenerate non-equilibrium driven-dissipative condensate with global $U(1)\times U(1)$ symmetry. Using dynamical renormalisation group in spatial dimension $d=1$, we demonstrate that coupled stochastic complex Ginsburg-Landau equations exhibit an emergent stationary distribution, enforcing KPZ dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ and static roughness exponent $\chi=1/2$ for both components. By tuning intercomponent interactions, the system can access other regimes, including a fragmented condensate regime from a dynamical instability in the phase fluctuations, as well as a spacetime vortex regime driven by the non-linear terms in the coupled KPZ equations. In stable regimes, we show that in specific submanifolds relevant to polaritons, the RG fixed point offers a transformation to decoupled KPZ equations. Our findings have broad implications for understanding multicomponent KPZ systems in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Magnetization induced skyrmion dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spinor condensate under sinusoidally varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the spin texture dynamics of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions under a sinusoidally varying magnetic field along the $x$-direction. This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture in the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the saddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely evolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system exhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange between the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is observed, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the skyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion chain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with the temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the oscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems from the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the orbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked to the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts for the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of scissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and analytic results for one-dimensional strongly interacting spinor gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of quantum physics' fundamental, but largely unsolved, problems is the computation of the correlation functions in many-body systems. In this paper we address this problem in the case of one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions in the presence of a confining potential. We take advantage of the fact that in the strong coupling limit, the wavefunction factorizes with the charge degrees of freedom expressed as a Slater determinant of spinless fermions and the spin sector described by a spin chain of Sutherland type with exchange coefficients that depend only on the trapping potential. This factorization is also present in the expressions for the correlation functions. Still, analytical and numerical investigations were hindered by the fact that the local exchange coefficients and the charge component of the correlators are expressed as $N-1$ multidimensional integrals, with $N$ the number of particles, which are notoriously hard to compute using conventional methods. We introduce a new approach to calculating these integrals that is extremely simple, scales polynomially with the number of particles, and is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods reported in the literature. This allows us to investigate the static and dynamic properties, temperature dependence, and nonequilibrium dynamics for systems with a larger number of particles than previously considered and discover new phenomena. We show that, contrary to natural expectations, the momentum distribution of strongly interacting trapped spinor gases becomes narrower as we increase the temperature and derive simple determinant representations for the correlators in the spin incoherent regime valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <title>Squeezing atomic $p$-orbital condensates for detecting gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision gravitational wave measurement transforms research beyond general relativity and cosmology. Advances are made by applying quantum enhanced interferometry into the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors. Here, we develop an atomic sensor that employs a $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice to project gravitational wave signals into an orbital squeezed state. This entangled state couples linearly to the spacetime distortion signals received via a Michelson interferometer. Simulation data show that this sensor improves sensitivity over LIGO's quantum noise by approximately one order of magnitude and detection volume by $\sim 10^3$ in key frequency regimes. Additionally, it reduces the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. These results suggest that atomic orbital squeezing offers a compelling alternative to conventional techniques, offering a qualitatively different avenue for gravitational wave-based detection of dark matter, black holes, and the equation of state in neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact mapping between identical particles in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics, including bosons, anyons and fermions, provided they share the same scattering length. This boson-anyon-fermion mapping facilitates the construction of anyons from a linear superposition of spatially symmetric and anti-symmetric states. We demonstrate this in a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with coexistent s- and p-wave interactions, where both types of bound states can be supported by manipulating spin channels. With a suitable symmetry-breaking field, these bound states are hybridized to form an anyonic molecule. The condensation of these molecules in a many-body system leads to anyonic superfluidity, characterized by fractional statistics upon spin exchange within a Cooper pair. These anyonic states can be detected through asymmetric momentum distributions with a chiral $k^{-3}$ tail for each spin at high momentum. Our results propose a convenient route for engineering fractional statistics and associated intriguing phases in the platform of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>

Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral function and nonequilibrium dynamics of the strongly interacting Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>
