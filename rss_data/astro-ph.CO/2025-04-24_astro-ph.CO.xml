      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</description>

      <title>Outer regions of galaxy clusters as a new probe to test modifications to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the caustic technique to samples of galaxy clusters stacked in redshift space to estimate the gravitational potential in the cluster's outer region and test modifications to the standard theory of gravity. We separate 122 galaxy clusters from the HeCS-SZ, HeCS-redMapper, and HeCS samples into four samples with increasing mass; we estimate four robust, highly constraining caustic profiles for these samples. The caustic masses of the four stacked clusters agree within $ 10\%$ with the corresponding median values of each cluster sample. By adopting the NFW density profile to model the gravitational potential, we recover the caustic profile $\mathcal{A}(r)$ up to radius $r_{\rm p} \sim 4.0\, {\rm Mpc}$. This comparison is a first-order validation of the mass-concentration relation for galaxy clusters expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We thus impose this correlation as a prior in our analysis. Based on our stacked clusters, we estimate the value of the filling factor, which enters the caustic technique, $\mathcal{F}_{\beta} = 0.59\pm 0.05$; we derive this value using real data alone and find it consistent with the value usually adopted in the literature. We then use the caustic profiles $\mathcal{A}(r)$ of the stacked clusters to constrain the chameleon gravity model. We find that the caustic profiles provide a stringent upper limit of $|f_{\rm R0}| \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-6}$ at $95\%$ C.L. limits in the $f(\mathcal{R})$ scenario. The formalism developed here shall be further refined to test modifications to gravity in the extended outer weak gravitational regions of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Constant-Roll Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant-roll inflation is a distinctive class of phenomenological inflationary models in which the inflaton's rate of roll remains constant. It provides an exact solution that is compatible with the latest observational constraints and offers a natural framework for enhancing the curvature power spectrum, which is relevant to the formation of primordial black holes. In this paper, I review constant-roll inflation in memory of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>Hint towards inconsistency between BAO and Supernovae Dataset: The Evidence of Redshift Evolving Dark Energy from DESI DR2 is Absent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of independent cosmological datasets is a route towards precision and accurate inference of the cosmological parameters if these observations are not contaminated by systematic effects. However, the presence of unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased inference of the cosmological parameters. In this work, we test the consistency of the two independent tracers of the low-redshift cosmic expansion, namely the supernovae dataset from Pantheon$+$ and the BAO dataset from DESI DR2 using the distance duality relation which is a cornerstone relation in cosmology under the framework of General Relativity. We find that these datasets violate the distance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution, hinting toward unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts. Coincidentally this effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae dataset and DESI datasets are combined without accounting for this inconsistency. Accounting for this effect in the likelihood refutes the previous claim of evidence of non-cosmological constant as dark energy model from DESI DR2, and shows a result consistent with cosmological constant with $w_0= -0.92\pm 0.08$ and $w_a= -0.49^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$. This indicates that the current conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due to the combination of two inconsistent datasets resulting in precise but inaccurate inference of cosmological parameters. In the future, tests of this kind for the consistency between different cosmological datasets will be essential for robust inference of cosmological parameters and for deciphering unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts from supernovae and BAO datasets.</description>

      <title>Dispu$\tau$able: the high cost of a low optical depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\tau\sim0.09)$ also reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3\sigma$ to $\simeq1.5\sigma$. Conversely, within $\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\tau = 0.090 \pm 0.012$. The required increase in $\tau$ is in $\simeq3-5\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. The importance of $\tau$ for several cosmological measurements strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT L-band observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster. Detection of synchrotron threads and jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations with modern radio interferometers are uncovering the intricate morphology of synchrotron sources in galaxy clusters, both those arising from the intracluster medium (ICM) and those associated with member galaxies. Moreover, in addition to the well-known radio tails from active galactic nuclei, radio continuum tails from jellyfish galaxies are being efficiently detected in nearby clusters and groups. Our goal is to investigate the radio emission from the Ophiuchus cluster, a massive, sloshing cluster in the local Universe ($z=0.0296$) that hosts a diffuse mini halo at its center. To achieve this, we analyzed a 7.25 h MeerKAT L-band observation, producing sensitive images at 1.28 GHz with multiple resolutions. A catalog of spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies was used to identify and study the member galaxies detected in radio. We discover thin threads of synchrotron emission embedded in the mini halo, two of which may be connected to the brightest cluster galaxy. We also report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in Ophiuchus, detecting six galaxies with radio continuum tails, one of which extending for $\sim$64 kpc at 1.28 GHz, making it one of the longest detected at such a high frequency. Finally, we propose an alternative scenario to explain the origin of a bright amorphous radio source, previously classified as a radio phoenix, aided by the comparison with recent simulations of radio jets undergoing kink instability. In Ophiuchus thin threads have been observed within the diffuse emission; a similar result was obtained in Perseus, another nearby cluster hosting a mini halo, suggesting that these structures may be a common feature in this kind of sources. Moreover, radio continuum observations have proven effective in detecting the first jellyfish galaxies in both systems.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the Detectability of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies and Outer-Halo Star Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to faint, resolved Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters. We characterize the expected sensitivity using simulated LSST data from the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2 (DC2) accessed and analyzed with the Rubin Science Platform as part of the Rubin Early Science Program. We simulate resolved stellar populations of Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters over a wide range of sizes, luminosities, and heliocentric distances, which are broadly consistent with expectations for the Milky Way satellite system. We inject simulated stars into the DC2 catalog with realistic photometric uncertainties and star/galaxy separation derived from the DC2 data itself. We assess the probability that each simulated system would be detected by LSST using a conventional isochrone matched-filter technique. We find that assuming perfect star/galaxy separation enables the detection of resolved stellar systems with $M_V$ = 0 mag and $r_{1/2}$ = 10 pc with &gt;50% efficiency out to a heliocentric distance of ~250 kpc. Similar detection efficiency is possible with a simple star/galaxy separation criterion based on measured quantities, although the false positive rate is higher due to leakage of background galaxies into the stellar sample. When assuming perfect star/galaxy classification and a model for the galaxy-halo connection fit to current data, we predict that 89 +/- 20 Milky Way satellite galaxies will be detectable with a simple matched-filter algorithm applied to the LSST wide-fast-deep data set. Different assumptions about the performance of star/galaxy classification efficiency can decrease this estimate by ~75-25%, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality star/galaxy separation for studies of the Milky Way satellite population with LSST.</description>

      <title>LTDE: The Lens Time Delay Experiment I. From pixels to light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars offer a unique opportunity to study cosmological and extragalactic phenomena, using reliable light curves of the lensed images. This requires accurate deblending of the quasar images, which is not trivial due to the small separation between the lensed images (typically $\sim1$ arcsec) and because there is light contamination by the lensing galaxy and the quasar host galaxy. We propose a series of experiments aimed at testing our ability to extract precise and accurate photometry of lensed quasars. In this first paper, we focus on evaluating our ability to extract light curves from simulated CCD images of lensed quasars spanning a broad range of configurations and assuming different observational/instrumental conditions. Specifically, the experiment proposes to go from pixels to light curves and to evaluate the limits of current photometric algorithms. Our experiment has several steps, from data with known point spread function (PSF), to an unknown spatially-variable PSF field that the user has to take into account. This paper is the release of our simulated images. Anyone can extract the light curves and submit their results by the deadline. These will be evaluated with the metrics described below. Our set of simulations will be public and it is meant to be a benchmark for time-domain surveys like Rubin-LSST or other follow-up time-domain observations at higher temporal cadence. It is also meant to be a test set to help develop new algorithms in the future.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16751v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Radiometer Calibration using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A radiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However, impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter with observable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a GeV-scale self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) candidate within a dark $U(1)_D$ gauged extension of the Standard Model (SM), addressing small-scale structure issues in $\Lambda$CDM while predicting an observable contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in the form of dark radiation. The model introduces a fermionic DM candidate $\chi$ and a scalar $\phi$, both charged under an unbroken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The self-interactions of $\chi$ are mediated by a light vector boson $X^\mu$, whose mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism. The relic abundance of $\chi$ is determined by thermal freeze-out through annihilations into $X^\mu$, supplemented by a non-thermal component from the late decay of $\phi$. Crucially, $\phi$ decays after the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) but before the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) epoch, producing additional $\chi$ and a dark radiation species ($\nu_S$). This late-time production compensates for thermal underabundance due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, while remaining consistent with structure formation constraints. The accompanying dark radiation yields a detectable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, compatible with Planck 2018 bounds and within reach of next-generation experiments such as SPT-3G, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on primordial magnetic fields from spectral distortions of cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: The magneto-hydrodynamic decay of primordial magnetic fields can distort the black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by draining magnetic energy into thermal plasmas and photons. The current limits on CMB distortion place constraints on small-scale primordial magnetic fields. The constraints crucially depend on the decay laws of primordial magnetic fields. Recent numerical simulations reveal that non-linear effects play a significant role in the magnetic field decay although these effects are neglected in previous works. In this paper, by adopting a reconnection-driven turbulent decay as a non-linear evolution model, we demonstrate the potential impact of non-linear effects on CMB spectral distortions. The reconnection-driven turbulent decay model is an analytical description which provides the consistent results with numerical simulation. Our results rule out magnetic fields with shorter coherence lengths. While the result is independent of the spectral index of the magnetic energy spectrum, it is influenced by the magnetic helicity fraction.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on dark energy-dark matter interaction from DESI DR2 in a field-theoretic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important issues both in particle physics and cosmology relates to whether dark energy is a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, or is dynamical in nature such as quintessence. In this work, we discuss a model of quintessence interacting with dark matter and analyze the resulting phenomenology of the dark energy equation of state. We identify two regions where the equation of state behaves differently depending on the size of the dark matter-dark energy interaction strength. We show that the strong coupling region induces a transmutation of quintessence from thawing to freezing. Using the recent data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we rule out this possibility of transmutation and investigate the weak coupling region to derive upper limits on the interaction strength. The interacting dark energy model is able to explain DESI's results without the equation of state crossing the phantom divide.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>Understanding acoustic scale observations: the one-sided fight against $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history through the comoving acoustic scale. The CMB angular scale measurement $\theta_*$ is particularly robust, constraining the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance to last scattering independently of the late-time cosmological model. For models with standard early-universe physics, this measurement strongly constrains possible deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We show that the null energy condition imposes strict inequalities on the BAO observables $D_H(z)$, $D_M(z)$, $D_V(z)$ and $F_{\rm AP}(z)$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These inequalities demonstrate that certain deviations from $\Lambda$CDM are impossible for any physical non-interacting dark energy model that respects the null energy condition within the context of FRW cosmological models. We also identify the regions of parameter space in the CPL parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ that can give predictions consistent with both the null energy condition and the observed CMB scale. While current DESI DR2 BAO measurements exhibit some joint-constraint parameter tensions with $\Lambda$CDM, this tension arises primarily in directions that are inconsistent with the null-energy condition, so $\Lambda$CDM is favoured by current acoustic scale measurements unless the null-energy condition is violated.</description>

      <title>Effect of Peak Absolute Magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae and Sound Horizon Values on Hubble Tension using DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply data-motivated priors on the peak absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae ($M$) and the sound horizon at the drag epoch ($r_d$), to study how the $M-r_d$ degeneracy affects low redshift measurements of the Hubble constant, and then compare these estimates to the Planck estimated value of the Hubble constant. We use the data from Pantheon$+$, Cosmic Chronometers, and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) results for this purpose. We reaffirm the fact that there is a degeneracy between $M$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to reconcile the discrepancy in Hubble constant values also requires a change in the peak absolute magnitude $M$. For certain $M$ and $r_d$ priors, the discrepancy is found to reduce to be as low as (1.2-2) $\sigma$ when considering the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We also notice that for our datasets considered, the Gaussian prior combination of $M \in \mathcal{N} (-19.253,0.027)$ (obtained from SH0ES) and $r_d \in \mathcal{N} (147.05,0.3)$ Mpc (determined from Planck CMB measurements) is least favored as compared to other prior combinations for the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Are quasars reliable standard candles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question whether the non-linear relation between the X-ray and UV emission of quasars can be used to derive their distances. In previous works of our group, we demonstrated that such a relation does not show any redshift evolution in its slope. The derived distances are in agreement with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model up to $z$$\sim$1.5, but they show significant deviations at higher redshifts. Yet, several authors suggested that this discrepancy is due to inconsistencies between the low- and high-redshift sources within the parent sample, or to a redshift evolution of the relation. Here, we discuss these issues through a quantitative comparison with supernova-derived distances in the common redshift range, complemented by simulations showing that all the claimed inconsistencies would naturally arise from any limitation of the cosmological model adopted for the data analysis, that is, from our ignorance of the true cosmology. We argue that the reliability of the method can only be based on a cosmology-independent evaluation of the hypothesis of non-evolution of the X-ray to UV relation at $z$&gt;1.5, subsequent to a careful check of the sample selection and of the flux measurements for possible redshift-dependent systematic effects. Since we do not conceive any physical reason for a sudden change of the normalization of the relation at $z$&gt;1.5, and we can exclude any severe systematic effect in the data selection and flux measurements, we conclude that the application of the X-ray to UV relation to cosmology is well motivated. To further strengthen this point, we need to achieve a better understanding of the physical process behind the observed relation and/or an independent observational proof possibly confirming the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM found with quasars, such as future supernova measurements at $z$$\sim$2 or higher.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency (at the time of emission) $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Impact of theoretical uncertainties on model parameter reconstruction from GW signals sourced by cosmological phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different computational techniques for cosmological phase transition parameters can impact the Gravitational Wave (GW) spectra predicted in a given particle physics model. To scrutinize the importance of this effect, we perform large-scale parameter scans of the dynamical real-singlet extended Standard Model using three perturbative approximations for the effective potential: the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes at leading order, and three-dimensional thermal effective theory (3D EFT) at next-to-leading order. While predictions of GW amplitudes are typically unreliable in the absence of higher-order corrections, we show that the reconstructed model parameter spaces are robust up to a few percent in uncertainty. While 3D EFT is accurate from one loop order, theoretical uncertainties of reconstructed model parameters, using four-dimensional standard techniques, remain dominant over the experimental ones even for signals merely strong enough to claim a detection by LISA.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW host-galaxy probability as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the host-galaxy probability function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the GW host-galaxy probability function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the host-galaxy probability function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic reverberations on a constrained $ f(Q,T) $-model of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an isotropic cosmological model in the $ f(Q, T) $ theory of gravity in the frame of a flat FLRW spacetime being $ Q $ the non-metricity tensor and $ T $ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The gravity function is taken to be a quadratic equation, $ f(Q, T)=\zeta Q^2 + \gamma T $, where $ \zeta&lt;0 $ and $ \gamma $ are the arbitrary constants. We constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $ and $ H_0 $ using the recent observational datasets: the Hubble dataset (OHD), the $ Pantheon $ dataset of $ 1048 $ points, and the joint dataset (OHD + $ Pantheon $). The universe model transitions from an early deceleration state to an acceleration in late times. This model also provides the ekpyrotic phase of the universe on the redshift $ z&gt;12.32 $. In this model, the Big Bang is described as a collision of branes, and thus, the Big Bang is not the beginning of time. Before the Big Bang, there is an ekpyrotic phase with the equation of state $ \omega &gt;&gt; 1 $. In late times, the undeviating Hubble measurements reduce the $ H_0 $ tension in the reconstructed $ f(Q, T) $ function. Additionally, we study various physical parameters of the model. Finally, our model describes a quintessence dark energy model at later times.</description>

Abstract: The dwarf galaxies comparable to the LMC and SMC, with stellar masses $7.5 &lt;{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})&lt;9.5$, are found in a diversity of environments and have long quenching timescales. We need to understand how this phenomenon is connected to the dwarfs' halo properties and their locations in the large-scale structure of the universe. We study the star-formation rates of dwarfs in the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project across different environments, focusing on field dwarfs in host halos with virial masses of $9 &lt; {\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.5$, in contrast to dwarf satellites in hosts with ${\rm log}(M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \geq 11.5$. Our field dwarf sample is heterogeneous, consisting of primary (central) galaxies, with smaller numbers of secondaries and dwarf galaxies that are on backsplash orbits around massive galaxies. We study how the quenched fraction and star-formation histories depend on the dwarfs' large-scale environment and find that only $\sim 1\%$ of the most isolated dwarfs are quenched. The vast majority of the quenched field dwarfs are backsplash dwarfs located in the neighborhood of cluster-scale halos. We discover a two-halo galactic conformity signal that arises from the tendency of the quenched dwarfs, particularly the backsplash sample, to have a quenched massive galaxy as a neighbor. We attribute the low quenched fractions of the simulated LMC/SMC analogs in the field to the locations of their low-mass hosts in the sparse large-scale environment, which predominate over the relatively small number of backsplash and quenched primary dwarfs in denser environments.</description>
