      <title>ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Data-Agnostic Robotic Long-Horizon Manipulation with Vision-Language-Guided Closed-Loop Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language-conditioned robotic manipulation have leveraged imitation and reinforcement learning to enable robots to execute tasks from human commands. However, these methods often suffer from limited generalization, adaptability, and the lack of large-scale specialized datasets, unlike data-rich domains such as computer vision, making long-horizon task execution challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce DAHLIA, a data-agnostic framework for language-conditioned long-horizon robotic manipulation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for real-time task planning and execution. DAHLIA employs a dual-tunnel architecture, where an LLM-powered planner collaborates with co-planners to decompose tasks and generate executable plans, while a reporter LLM provides closed-loop feedback, enabling adaptive re-planning and ensuring task recovery from potential failures. Moreover, DAHLIA integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) in task reasoning and temporal abstraction for efficient action execution, enhancing traceability and robustness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-horizon tasks, achieving strong generalization in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

      <title>Pretrained Bayesian Non-parametric Knowledge Prior in Robotic Long-Horizon Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically learn new tasks from scratch, often disregarding prior knowledge that could accelerate the learning process. While some methods incorporate previously learned skills, they usually rely on a fixed structure, such as a single Gaussian distribution, to define skill priors. This rigid assumption can restrict the diversity and flexibility of skills, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a method that models potential primitive skill motions as having non-parametric properties with an unknown number of underlying features. We utilize a Bayesian non-parametric model, specifically Dirichlet Process Mixtures, enhanced with birth and merge heuristics, to pre-train a skill prior that effectively captures the diverse nature of skills. Additionally, the learned skills are explicitly trackable within the prior space, enhancing interpretability and control. By integrating this flexible skill prior into an RL framework, our approach surpasses existing methods in long-horizon manipulation tasks, enabling more efficient skill transfer and task success in complex environments. Our findings show that a richer, non-parametric representation of skill priors significantly improves both the learning and execution of challenging robotic tasks.

      <title>Bresa: Bio-inspired Reflexive Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL)-based robotic systems is a critical challenge, especially in contact-rich tasks within unstructured environments. While the state-of-the-art safe RL approaches mitigate risks through safe exploration or high-level recovery mechanisms, they often overlook low-level execution safety, where reflexive responses to potential hazards are crucial. Similarly, variable impedance control (VIC) enhances safety by adjusting the robot's mechanical response, yet lacks a systematic way to adapt parameters, such as stiffness and damping throughout the task. In this paper, we propose Bresa, a Bio-inspired Reflexive Hierarchical Safe RL method inspired by biological reflexes. Our method decouples task learning from safety learning, incorporating a safety critic network that evaluates action risks and operates at a higher frequency than the task solver. Unlike existing recovery-based methods, our safety critic functions at a low-level control layer, allowing real-time intervention when unsafe conditions arise. The task-solving RL policy, running at a lower frequency, focuses on high-level planning (decision-making), while the safety critic ensures instantaneous safety corrections. We validate Bresa on multiple tasks including a contact-rich robotic task, demonstrating its reflexive ability to enhance safety, and adaptability in unforeseen dynamic environments. Our results show that Bresa outperforms the baseline, providing a robust and reflexive safety mechanism that bridges the gap between high-level planning and low-level execution.

      <title>Bayesian Inferential Motion Planning Using Heavy-Tailed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots rely on motion planning to navigate safely and efficiently while performing various tasks. In this paper, we investigate motion planning through Bayesian inference, where motion plans are inferred based on planning objectives and constraints. However, existing Bayesian motion planning methods often struggle to explore low-probability regions of the planning space, where high-quality plans may reside. To address this limitation, we propose the use of heavy-tailed distributions -- specifically, Student's-$t$ distributions -- to enhance probabilistic inferential search for motion plans. We develop a novel sequential single-pass smoothing approach that integrates Student's-$t$ distribution with Monte Carlo sampling. A special case of this approach is ensemble Kalman smoothing, which depends on short-tailed Gaussian distributions. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating its superior performance in planning, sampling efficiency, and constraint satisfaction compared to ensemble Kalman smoothing. While focused on motion planning, this work points to the broader potential of heavy-tailed distributions in enhancing probabilistic decision-making in robotics.</description>

      <title>REMAC: Self-Reflective and Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Collaboration for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic understanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods typically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed task-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or unexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the microwave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two critical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we propose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables efficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution through continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key modules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition checks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement module dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers several appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about the environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on potential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific insights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks in parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's effectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot manipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with 27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark state-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and Grok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by 40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Hybrid Multi-Agent Pathfinding Based on Shared Exploration Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding is used in areas including multi-robot formations, warehouse logistics, and intelligent vehicles. However, many environments are incomplete or frequently change, making it difficult for standard centralized planning or pure reinforcement learning to maintain both global solution quality and local flexibility. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that integrates D* Lite global search with multi-agent reinforcement learning, using a switching mechanism and a freeze-prevention strategy to handle dynamic conditions and crowded settings. We evaluate the framework in the discrete POGEMA environment and compare it with baseline methods. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed framework substantially improves success rate, collision rate, and path efficiency. The model is further tested on the EyeSim platform, where it maintains feasible Pathfinding under frequent changes and large-scale robot deployments.</description>

      <title>3D Acetabular Surface Reconstruction from 2D Pre-operative X-ray Images using SRVF Elastic Registration and Deformation Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable selection of the appropriate acetabular cup size is crucial for restoring joint biomechanics in total hip arthroplasty (THA). This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates square-root velocity function (SRVF)-based elastic shape registration technique with an embedded deformation (ED) graph approach to reconstruct the 3D articular surface of the acetabulum by fusing multiple views of 2D pre-operative pelvic X-ray images and a hemispherical surface model. The SRVF-based elastic registration establishes 2D-3D correspondences between the parametric hemispherical model and X-ray images, and the ED framework incorporates the SRVF-derived correspondences as constraints to optimize the 3D acetabular surface reconstruction using nonlinear least-squares optimization. Validations using both simulation and real patient datasets are performed to demonstrate the robustness and the potential clinical value of the proposed algorithm. The reconstruction result can assist surgeons in selecting the correct acetabular cup on the first attempt in primary THA, minimising the need for revision surgery.</description>

      <title>IKSel: Selecting Good Seed Joint Values for Fast Numerical Inverse Kinematics Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the numerical inverse kinematics (IK) problem, leveraging modern computational resources and refining the seed selection process to develop a solver that is competitive with analytical-based methods. The proposed seed selection strategy consists of three key stages: (1) utilizing a K-Dimensional Tree (KDTree) to identify seed candidates based on workspace proximity, (2) sorting candidates by joint space adjustment and attempting numerical iterations with the one requiring minimal adjustment, and (3) re-selecting the most distant joint configurations for new attempts in case of failures. The joint space adjustment-based seed selection increases the likelihood of rapid convergence, while the re-attempt strategy effectively helps circumvent local minima and joint limit constraints. Comparison results with both traditional numerical solvers and learning-based methods demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach in terms of success rate, time efficiency, and accuracy. Additionally, we conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze the effects of various parameters and solver settings, providing practical insights for customization and optimization. The proposed method consistently exhibits high success rates and computational efficiency. It is suitable for time-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Bimanual Regrasp Planning and Control for Eliminating Object Pose Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely grasping an object is a challenging task due to pose uncertainties. Conventional methods have used cameras and fixtures to reduce object uncertainty. They are effective but require intensive preparation, such as designing jigs based on the object geometry and calibrating cameras with high-precision tools fabricated using lasers. In this study, we propose a method to reduce the uncertainty of the position and orientation of a grasped object without using a fixture or a camera. Our method is based on the concept that the flat finger pads of a parallel gripper can reduce uncertainty along its opening/closing direction through flat surface contact. Three orthogonal grasps by parallel grippers with flat finger pads collectively constrain an object's position and orientation to a unique state. Guided by the concepts, we develop a regrasp planning and admittance control approach that sequentially finds and leverages three orthogonal grasps of two robotic arms to eliminate uncertainties in the object pose. We evaluated the proposed method on different initial object uncertainties and verified that the method has satisfactory repeatability accuracy. It outperforms an AR marker detection method implemented using cameras and laser jet printers under standard laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>FLAM: Foundation Model-Based Body Stabilization for Humanoid Locomotion and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots have attracted significant attention in recent years. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the main ways to control the whole body of humanoid robots. RL enables agents to complete tasks by learning from environment interactions, guided by task rewards. However, existing RL methods rarely explicitly consider the impact of body stability on humanoid locomotion and manipulation. Achieving high performance in whole-body control remains a challenge for RL methods that rely solely on task rewards. In this paper, we propose a Foundation model-based method for humanoid Locomotion And Manipulation (FLAM for short). FLAM integrates a stabilizing reward function with a basic policy. The stabilizing reward function is designed to encourage the robot to learn stable postures, thereby accelerating the learning process and facilitating task completion. Specifically, the robot pose is first mapped to the 3D virtual human model. Then, the human pose is stabilized and reconstructed through a human motion reconstruction model. Finally, the pose before and after reconstruction is used to compute the stabilizing reward. By combining this stabilizing reward with the task reward, FLAM effectively guides policy learning. Experimental results on a humanoid robot benchmark demonstrate that FLAM outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving stability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Robust simultaneous UWB-anchor calibration and robot localization for emergency situations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework. The supplementary video and codes can be accessed via https://github.com/LiuxhRobotAI/Simultaneous_calibration_localization.</description>

      <title>Grasping a Handful: Sequential Multi-Object Dexterous Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the sequential multi-object robotic grasp sampling algorithm SeqGrasp that can robustly synthesize stable grasps on diverse objects using the robotic hand's partial Degrees of Freedom (DoF). We use SeqGrasp to construct the large-scale Allegro Hand sequential grasping dataset SeqDataset and use it for training the diffusion-based sequential grasp generator SeqDiffuser. We experimentally evaluate SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser against the state-of-the-art non-sequential multi-object grasp generation method MultiGrasp in simulation and on a real robot. The experimental results demonstrate that SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser reach an 8.71%-43.33% higher grasp success rate than MultiGrasp. Furthermore, SeqDiffuser is approximately 1000 times faster at generating grasps than SeqGrasp and MultiGrasp.</description>

      <title>Collapse and Collision Aware Grasping for Cluttered Shelf Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and safe retrieval of stacked objects in warehouse environments is a significant challenge due to complex spatial dependencies and structural inter-dependencies. Traditional vision-based methods excel at object localization but often lack the physical reasoning required to predict the consequences of extraction, leading to unintended collisions and collapses. This paper proposes a collapse and collision aware grasp planner that integrates dynamic physics simulations for robotic decision-making. Using a single image and depth map, an approximate 3D representation of the scene is reconstructed in a simulation environment, enabling the robot to evaluate different retrieval strategies before execution. Two approaches 1) heuristic-based and 2) physics-based are proposed for both single-box extraction and shelf clearance tasks. Extensive real-world experiments on structured and unstructured box stacks, along with validation using datasets from existing databases, show that our physics-aware method significantly improves efficiency and success rates compared to baseline heuristics.</description>

      <title>Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Kinematic Actuation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, several recently released humanoid robots are using actuator configuration in which the motor is displaced from the joint location to optimize the leg inertia. This in turn induces a non linearity in the reduction ratio of the transmission which is often neglected when computing the robot motion (e.g. by trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning) and only accounted for at control time. This paper proposes an analytical method to efficiently handle this non-linearity. Using this actuation model, we demonstrate that we can leverage the dynamic abilities of the non-linear transmission while only modeling the inertia of the main serial chain of the leg, without approximating the motor capabilities nor the joint range. Based on analytical inverse kinematics, our method does not need any numerical routines dedicated to the closed-kinematics actuation, hence leading to very efficient computations. Our study focuses on two mechanisms widely used in recent humanoid robots; the four bar knee linkage as well as a parallel 2 DoF ankle mechanism. We integrate these models inside optimization based (DDP) and learning (PPO) control approaches. A comparison of our model against a simplified model that completely neglects closed chains is then shown in simulation.</description>

      <title>Scenario Dreamer: Vectorized Latent Diffusion for Generating Driving Simulation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene - comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature has inspired humans in different ways. The formation behavior of animals can perform tasks that exceed individual capability. For example, army ants could transverse gaps by forming bridges, and fishes could group up to protect themselves from predators. The pattern formation task is essential in a multiagent robotic system because it usually serves as the initial configuration of downstream tasks, such as collective manipulation and adaptation to various environments. The formation of complex shapes, especially hollow shapes, remains an open question. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to close the hole due to accumulated localization errors. Inspired by the ribbon idea introduced in the additive self-assembly algorithm by the Kilobot team, we develop a two-stage algorithm that does not require global coordinates information and effectively forms shapes with holes. In this paper, we investigate the partitioning of the shape using ribbons in a hexagonal lattice setting and propose the add-subtract algorithm based on the movement sequence induced by the ribbon structure. This advancement opens the door to tasks requiring complex pattern formations, such as the assembly of nanobots for medical applications involving intricate structures and the deployment of robots along the boundaries of areas of interest. We also provide simulation results on complex shapes, an analysis of the robustness as well as a proof of correctness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</description>

      <title>SafeCast: Risk-Responsive Motion Forecasting for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous driving (AD) systems. While existing methods have made significant progress, they often overlook explicit safety constraints and struggle to capture the complex interactions among traffic agents, environmental factors, and motion dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SafeCast, a risk-responsive motion forecasting model that integrates safety-aware decision-making with uncertainty-aware adaptability. SafeCast is the first to incorporate the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework into motion forecasting, encoding interpretable safety rules--such as safe distances and collision avoidance--based on traffic norms and physical principles. To further enhance robustness, we introduce the Graph Uncertainty Feature (GUF), a graph-based module that injects learnable noise into Graph Attention Networks, capturing real-world uncertainties and enhancing generalization across diverse scenarios. We evaluate SafeCast on four real-world benchmark datasets--Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), ApolloScape, and the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD)--covering highway, urban, and mixed-autonomy traffic environments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy while maintaining a lightweight architecture and low inference latency, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in safety-critical AD systems.</description>

      <title>Task Hierarchical Control via Null-Space Projection and Path Integral Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of hierarchical task control, where a robotic system must perform multiple subtasks with varying levels of priority. A commonly used approach for hierarchical control is the null-space projection technique, which ensures that higher-priority tasks are executed without interference from lower-priority ones. While effective, the state-of-the-art implementations of this method rely on low-level controllers, such as PID controllers, which can be prone to suboptimal solutions in complex tasks. This paper presents a novel framework for hierarchical task control, integrating the null-space projection technique with the path integral control method. Our approach leverages Monte Carlo simulations for real-time computation of optimal control inputs, allowing for the seamless integration of simpler PID-like controllers with a more sophisticated optimal control technique. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined approach, showing how it overcomes the limitations of traditional</description>

      <title>Next-Best-Trajectory Planning of Robot Manipulators for Effective Observation and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual observation of objects is essential for many robotic applications, such as object reconstruction and manipulation, navigation, and scene understanding. Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Sim-and-Real Cotraining Of Diffusion Policies For Planar Pushing from Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In imitation learning for robotics, cotraining with demonstration data generated both in simulation and on real hardware has emerged as a powerful recipe to overcome the sim2real gap. This work seeks to elucidate basic principles of this sim-and-real cotraining to help inform simulation design, sim-and-real dataset creation, and policy training. Focusing narrowly on the canonical task of planar pushing from camera inputs enabled us to be thorough in our study. These experiments confirm that cotraining with simulated data \emph{can} dramatically improve performance in real, especially when real data is limited. Performance gains scale with simulated data, but eventually plateau; real-world data increases this performance ceiling. The results also suggest that reducing the domain gap in physics may be more important than visual fidelity for non-prehensile manipulation tasks. Perhaps surprisingly, having some visual domain gap actually helps the cotrained policy -- binary probes reveal that high-performing policies learn to distinguish simulated domains from real. We conclude by investigating this nuance and mechanisms that facilitate positive transfer between sim-and-real. In total, our experiments span over 40 real-world policies (evaluated on 800+ trials) and 200 simulated policies (evaluated on 40,000+ trials).</description>

      <title>Threshold Adaptation in Spiking Networks Enables Shortest Path Finding and Place Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient spatial navigation is a hallmark of the mammalian brain, inspiring the development of neuromorphic systems that mimic biological principles. Despite progress, implementing key operations like back-tracing and handling ambiguity in bio-inspired spiking neural networks remains an open challenge. This work proposes a mechanism for activity back-tracing in arbitrary, uni-directional spiking neuron graphs. We extend the existing replay mechanism of the spiking hierarchical temporal memory (S-HTM) by our spike timing-dependent threshold adaptation (STDTA), which enables us to perform path planning in networks of spiking neurons. We further present an ambiguity dependent threshold adaptation (ADTA) for identifying places in an environment with less ambiguity, enhancing the localization estimate of an agent. Combined, these methods enable efficient identification of the shortest path to an unambiguous target. Our experiments show that a network trained on sequences reliably computes shortest paths with fewer replays than the steps required to reach the target. We further show that we can identify places with reduced ambiguity in multiple, similar environments. These contributions advance the practical application of biologically inspired sequential learning algorithms like the S-HTM towards neuromorphic localization and navigation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Omakase: Designing Shared Control for Navigation Robots with Blind People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation robots can increase the independence of blind people but often limit user control, following what is called in Japanese an "omakase" approach where decisions are left to the robot. This research investigates ways to enhance user control in social robot navigation, based on two studies conducted with blind participants. The first study, involving structured interviews (N=14), identified crowded spaces as key areas with significant social challenges. The second study (N=13) explored navigation tasks with an autonomous robot in these environments and identified design strategies across different modes of autonomy. Participants preferred an active role, termed the "boss" mode, where they managed crowd interactions, while the "monitor" mode helped them assess the environment, negotiate movements, and interact with the robot. These findings highlight the importance of shared control and user involvement for blind users, offering valuable insights for designing future social navigation robots.</description>

      <title>CoT-VLA: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown potential in leveraging pretrained vision-language models and diverse robot demonstrations for learning generalizable sensorimotor control. While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. We introduce CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

      <title>Deep Depth Estimation from Thermal Image: Dataset, Benchmark, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust and accurate spatial perception under adverse weather and lighting conditions is crucial for the high-level autonomy of self-driving vehicles and robots. However, existing perception algorithms relying on the visible spectrum are highly affected by weather and lighting conditions. A long-wave infrared camera (i.e., thermal imaging camera) can be a potential solution to achieve high-level robustness. However, the absence of large-scale datasets and standardized benchmarks remains a significant bottleneck to progress in active research for robust visual perception from thermal images. To this end, this manuscript provides a large-scale Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS$^2$) dataset that consists of stereo RGB, stereo NIR, stereo thermal, stereo LiDAR data, and GNSS/IMU information along with semi-dense depth ground truth. MS$^2$ dataset includes 162K synchronized multi-modal data pairs captured across diverse locations (e.g., urban city, residential area, campus, and high-way road) at different times (e.g., morning, daytime, and nighttime) and under various weather conditions (e.g., clear-sky, cloudy, and rainy). Secondly, we conduct a thorough evaluation of monocular and stereo depth estimation networks across RGB, NIR, and thermal modalities to establish standardized benchmark results on MS$^2$ depth test sets (e.g., day, night, and rainy). Lastly, we provide in-depth analyses and discuss the challenges revealed by the benchmark results, such as the performance variability for each modality under adverse conditions, domain shift between different sensor modalities, and potential research direction for thermal perception. Our dataset and source code are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/multi-spectral-stereo-dataset and https://github.com/UkcheolShin/SupDepth4Thermal.</description>

Abstract: Lane keeping in autonomous driving systems requires scenario-specific weight tuning for different objectives. We formulate lane-keeping as a constrained reinforcement learning problem, where weight coefficients are automatically learned along with the policy, eliminating the need for scenario-specific tuning. Empirically, our approach outperforms traditional RL in efficiency and reliability. Additionally, real-world demonstrations validate its practical value for real-world autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific inquiry highlights an urgent need for groundbreaking methodologies that transcend the limitations of traditional research. Conventional approaches, bogged down by manual processes and siloed expertise, struggle to keep pace with the demands of modern discovery. We envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) system-a fusion of agentic AI and embodied robotics-that redefines the research lifecycle. This system promises to autonomously navigate physical and digital realms, weaving together insights from disparate disciplines with unprecedented efficiency. By embedding advanced AI and robot technologies into every phase-from hypothesis formulation to peer-ready manuscripts-AGS could slash the time and resources needed for scientific research in diverse field. We foresee a future where scientific discovery follows new scaling laws, driven by the proliferation and sophistication of such systems. As these autonomous agents and robots adapt to extreme environments and leverage a growing reservoir of knowledge, they could spark a paradigm shift, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and ushering in an era of relentless innovation.</description>

Abstract: We present Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model (DGDM), a data-driven framework for generating task-specific manipulator designs without task-specific training. Given object shapes and task specifications, DGDM generates sensor-less manipulator designs that can blindly manipulate objects towards desired motions and poses using an open-loop parallel motion. This framework 1) flexibly represents manipulation tasks as interaction profiles, 2) represents the design space using a geometric diffusion model, and 3) efficiently searches this design space using the gradients provided by a dynamics network trained without any task information. We evaluate DGDM on various manipulation tasks ranging from shifting/rotating objects to converging objects to a specific pose. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based and unguided diffusion baselines relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average success rate. With the ability to generate a new design within 0.8s, DGDM facilitates rapid design iteration and enhances the adoption of data-driven approaches for robot mechanism design.

      <title>Dynamic Motion/Force Control of Mobile Manipulators via Extended-UDE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators are known for their superior mobility over manipulators on fixed bases, offering promising applications in smart industry and housekeeping scenarios. The dynamic coupling nature between the mobile base and the manipulator presents challenges for force interactive tasks of the mobile manipulator. However, current strategies often fail to account for this coupling in such scenarios. To address this, this paper presents a dynamic coupling-integrated manipulator model that requires only the manipulator dynamics and the mobile base kinematics, which simplifies the modeling process. In addition, embedding the dynamic model, an extended uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE) is proposed for the mobile manipulator, which separately estimates the dynamic coupling terms and other unmodeled uncertainties, incorporating them into the feedforward and feedback control loops, respectively. The proposed approach increases the speed of response of the system and improves the dynamic robot-environment interaction (REI) performance of the mobile manipulator. A series of simulations and experiments of a wall-cleaning task are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the motion/force tracking performance when the mobile base is in dynamic motion.</description>

      <title>Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies for Dynamic Bipedal Loco-Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic loco-manipulation calls for effective whole-body control and contact-rich interactions with the object and the environment. Existing learning-based control synthesis relies on training low-level skill policies and explicitly switching with a high-level policy or a hand-designed finite state machine, leading to quasi-static behaviors. In contrast, dynamic tasks such as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an optimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal - a continuum of smooth motion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies (OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred sequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design hybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics and discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded exploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we present a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The proposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like soccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In soccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to contact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops. Leveraging the oracle's abstraction, we solve each loco-manipulation task on robots with varying morphologies, including HECTOR V1, Berkeley Humanoid, Unitree G1, and H1, using the same reward definition and weights.</description>

      <title>LoRD: Adapting Differentiable Driving Policies to Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between operational domains can severely affect the performance of learned models in self-driving vehicles (SDVs). While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time State Estimation Methods in Robotics: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate, efficient, and robust state estimation is more important than ever in robotics as the variety of platforms and complexity of tasks continue to grow. Historically, discrete-time filters and smoothers have been the dominant approach, in which the estimated variables are states at discrete sample times. The paradigm of continuous-time state estimation proposes an alternative strategy by estimating variables that express the state as a continuous function of time, which can be evaluated at any query time. Not only can this benefit downstream tasks such as planning and control, but it also significantly increases estimator performance and flexibility, as well as reduces sensor preprocessing and interfacing complexity. Despite this, continuous-time methods remain underutilized, potentially because they are less well-known within robotics. To remedy this, this work presents a unifying formulation of these methods and the most exhaustive literature review to date, systematically categorizing prior work by methodology, application, state variables, historical context, and theoretical contribution to the field. By surveying splines and Gaussian processes together and contextualizing works from other research domains, this work identifies and analyzes open problems in continuous-time state estimation and suggests new research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Map-based LiDAR localization, while widely used in autonomous systems, faces significant challenges in degraded environments due to lacking distinct geometric features. This paper introduces SuperLoc, a robust LiDAR localization package that addresses key limitations in existing methods. SuperLoc features a novel predictive alignment risk assessment technique, enabling early detection and mitigation of potential failures before optimization. This approach significantly improves performance in challenging scenarios such as corridors, tunnels, and caves. Unlike existing degeneracy mitigation algorithms that rely on post-optimization analysis and heuristic thresholds, SuperLoc evaluates the localizability of raw sensor measurements. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various degraded environments. Our approach achieves a 54% increase in accuracy and exhibits the highest robustness. To facilitate further research, we release our implementation along with datasets from eight challenging scenarios</description>

      <title>Non-Prehensile Tool-Object Manipulation by Integrating LLM-Based Planning and Manoeuvrability-Driven Controls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to wield tools was once considered exclusive to human intelligence, but it's now known that many other animals, like crows, possess this capability. Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert the human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</description>

      <title>VidBot: Learning Generalizable 3D Actions from In-the-Wild 2D Human Videos for Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future robots are envisioned as versatile systems capable of performing a variety of household tasks. The big question remains, how can we bridge the embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human videos to make robot learning more scalable.</description>

      <title>LaMOuR: Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17125v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle.

      <title>Learning Multi-Robot Coordination through Locality-Based Factorized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning method called \textbf{Loc}ality based \textbf{Fac}torized \textbf{M}ulti-Agent \textbf{A}ctor-\textbf{C}ritic (Loc-FACMAC). Existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as FACMAC, rely on global reward information, which may not accurately reflect the quality of individual robots' actions in decentralized systems. We integrate the concept of locality into critic learning, where strongly related robots form partitions during training. Robots within the same partition have a greater impact on each other, leading to more precise policy evaluation. Additionally, we construct a dependency graph to capture the relationships between robots, facilitating the partitioning process. This approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality and prevents robots from using irrelevant information. Our method improves existing algorithms by focusing on local rewards and leveraging partition-based learning to enhance training efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of Loc-FACMAC in three environments: Hallway, Multi-cartpole, and Bounded-Cooperative-Navigation. We explore the impact of partition sizes on the performance and compare the result with baseline MARL algorithms such as LOMAQ, FACMAC, and QMIX. The experiments reveal that, if the locality structure is defined properly, Loc-FACMAC outperforms these baseline algorithms up to 108\%, indicating that exploiting the locality structure in the actor-critic framework improves the MARL performance.</description>

      <title>AcL: Action Learner for Fault-Tolerant Quadruped Locomotion Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots can learn versatile locomotion skills but remain vulnerable when one or more joints lose power. In contrast, dogs and cats can adopt limping gaits when injured, demonstrating their remarkable ability to adapt to physical conditions. Inspired by such adaptability, this paper presents Action Learner (AcL), a novel teacher-student reinforcement learning framework that enables quadrupeds to autonomously adapt their gait for stable walking under multiple joint faults. Unlike conventional teacher-student approaches that enforce strict imitation, AcL leverages teacher policies to generate style rewards, guiding the student policy without requiring precise replication. We train multiple teacher policies, each corresponding to a different fault condition, and subsequently distill them into a single student policy with an encoder-decoder architecture. While prior works primarily address single-joint faults, AcL enables quadrupeds to walk with up to four faulty joints across one or two legs, autonomously switching between different limping gaits when faults occur. We validate AcL on a real Go2 quadruped robot under single- and double-joint faults, demonstrating fault-tolerant, stable walking, smooth gait transitions between normal and lamb gaits, and robustness against external disturbances.</description>

      <title>SkillMimic: Learning Basketball Interaction Skills from Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning methods for human-object interaction (HOI) rely on labor-intensive, manually designed skill rewards that do not generalize well across different interactions. We introduce SkillMimic, a unified data-driven framework that fundamentally changes how agents learn interaction skills by eliminating the need for skill-specific rewards. Our key insight is that a unified HOI imitation reward can effectively capture the essence of diverse interaction patterns from HOI datasets. This enables SkillMimic to learn a single policy that not only masters multiple interaction skills but also facilitates skill transitions, with both diversity and generalization improving as the HOI dataset grows. For evaluation, we collect and introduce two basketball datasets containing approximately 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Extensive experiments show that SkillMimic successfully masters a wide range of basketball skills including stylistic variations in dribbling, layup, and shooting. Moreover, these learned skills can be effectively composed by a high-level controller to accomplish complex and long-horizon tasks such as consecutive scoring, opening new possibilities for scalable and generalizable interaction skill learning.

      <title>Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</description>
