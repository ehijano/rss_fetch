      <title>Progress in Chromatic Calorimetry Concept: Improved Techniques for Energy Resolution and Particle Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces chromatic calorimetry, a novel particle detection method that uses strategically layered scintillators with different emission wavelengths. This approach aims to enhance energy measurement by capturing particle interactions at different shower depths through wavelength-based discrimination. Our experimental validation of this novel method utilizes an arrangement of scintillator materials to improve energy resolution and particle identification. The stacking arrangement of scintillators is organized by their emission wavelengths to track the development of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. By testing electrons and pions with energies up to 100 GeV, the setup demonstrated better discrimination and provided detailed measurements of shower profiles. The results indicate that our experimental validation significantly aims to enhance particle identification and energy resolution, highlighting its potential value in high-energy particle detection. Future work will explore the integration of Quantum Dots (QD) technology to advance these capabilities in chromatic calorimetry further.</description>

      <title>In-situ high voltage generation with Cockcroft-Walton multiplier for xenon gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08554v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used in a gas time projection chamber (TPC). TPC requires a high voltage to form an electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage from outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough. An alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure vessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. CW multiplier can convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it suitable for this purpose.
  We have integrated the CW multiplier into a high-pressure xenon gas TPC, called AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence detector), which have been developed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. It detects ionization electrons by detecting electroluminescence with silicon photomultipliers, making it strong against electrical noises. An operation with the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC was operated for 77 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67 $\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.</description>

      <title>First-Ever Deployment of a SiPM-on-Tile Calorimeter in a Collider: A Parasitic Test with 200 GeV $pp$ Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the testing of a prototype SiPM-on-tile iron-scintillator calorimeter at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) during its 200 GeV $pp$ run in 2024. The prototype, measuring $20 \times 20 \, \text{cm}^{2}$ and 24 radiation lengths in depth, was positioned in the STAR experimental hall, approximately 8 m from the interaction point and 65 cm from the beam line, covering a pseudorapidity range of about $3.1&lt;\eta&lt;3.4$. By using the dark current of a reference SiPM as a radiation monitor, we estimate that the prototype was exposed to a fluence of about $10^{10}$ 1-MeV $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$. Channel-by-channel calibration was performed in a data-driven way with the signature from minimum-ionizing particles during beam-on conditions. A Geant4 detector simulation, with inputs from the Pythia8 event generator, describes measurements of energy spectra and hit multiplicities reasonably well. These results mark the first deployment, commissioning, calibration, and long-term operation of a SiPM-on-tile calorimeter in a collider environment. This experimental campaign will guide detector designs and operational strategies for the ePIC detector at the future EIC, as well as other applications.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Manipulation of Rydberg States for Very Low Frequency Fields Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very low frequency(VLF) band is widely used in submarine communication and geophysical exploration for its strong penetration and long-distance propagation. This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates Rydberg EIT in 133Cs vapor under VLF and DC fields. A model is established to describe the EIT spectral response under dual-field conditions, with theoretical predictions showing agreement with experimental results. We propose a novel calibration-free method to measure VLF electric fields, bypassing traditional Stark shift measurements. This method detects additional splitting intervals of Stark sublevels, separated from the degenerate energy level under a DC field. This phenomenon arises from the averaging effect of sublevel sinusoidal oscillations in the spectrum induced by the VLF field. The splitting interval is proportionally dependent on the VLF field amplitude. The VLF electric field sensor is enhanced by increasing the strength of the DC field, extending the traceable measurement limit for weak VLF electric fields by more than an order of magnitude. This work highlights the potential for precise VLF electric field measurements, significantly advancing the calibration-free detection capabilities of Rydberg atom sensors for low-frequency applications.</description>

      <title>First experimental results and optimization study of the portable neutron-gamma imager GN-Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GN-Vision is a compact, dual-modality imaging device designed to simultaneously localize the spatial origin of $\gamma$-ray and slow neutron sources, with potential applications in nuclear safety, security, and hadron therapy. The system utilizes two position-sensitive detection planes, combining Compton imaging techniques for $\gamma$-ray visualization with passive collimation for imaging slow and thermal neutrons (energies below 100 eV). This paper presents the first experimental outcomes from the initial GN-Vision prototype, focused on the development of its neutron imaging capabilities. Following this experimental assessment, we explore the device$'$s performance potential and discuss several Monte Carlo simulation-based optimizations aimed at refining the neutron collimation system. These optimizations seek to improve real-time imaging efficiency and cost-effectiveness, enhancing GN-Vision$'$s applicability for future practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Applications of the All-Sky Camera at the Ali Observatory in Tibet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-precision calibration method for all-sky cameras has been realized using images from the Ali observatory in Tibet, providing application results for atmospheric extinction, night sky brightness, and known variable stars. This method achieves high-precision calibration for individual all-sky images, with the calibration process introducing deviations of less than 0.5pixels. Within a 70-degree zenith angle, the calibration deviation of the images is less than 0.25pixels. Beyond this angle, the calibration deviation increases significantly due to the sparser distribution of stars. Increasing the number of stars with zenith angles greater than 70degrees used for calibration can improve the calibration accuracy for areas beyond the 70-degree zenith angle, reducing the calibration deviation at an 85-degree zenith angle to 0.2pixels. Analysis of the all-sky images indicates that the atmospheric extinction coefficient at the Ali Observatory is approximately 0.20, and the night sky background brightness is about 21 magnitudes per square arcsecond, suggesting the presence of urban light pollution.</description>

      <title>2p-2h Cross-Section Systematics in DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the operation of precision neutrino experiments, the understanding of neutrino interactions with matter is a preconditioned requirement for all detections and measurements of neutrinos. The largest uncertainties in estimating neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections arise from the incomplete understanding of nuclear effects. In the study of neutrino oscillations and nuclear scattering processes, obtaining an interaction model with associated uncertainties is of substantial interest for the neutrino physics community. This report presents studies of simulated CC 2p-2h interactions, in which a neutrino interacts with a bound pair of nucleons. This interaction mode is very poorly constrained by current data. A comparison of three leading CC 2p-2h models is presented, along with a number of uncertainty parameters that have been implemented to account for model-to-model discrepancies in the DUNE oscillation analysis.</description>

      <title>DMCpy: A powder and single crystal neutron diffraction software for DMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently upgraded DMC diffractometer at SINQ, equipped with a state-of-the-art 2D He detector, enables high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments optimized for both powder and single-crystal studies. To address the increased complexity and volume of data produced by this instrument, we developed DMCPy, a Python-based software package tailored specifically for DMC data analysis. DMCPy facilitates seamless data reduction and visualization, supporting conversion to reciprocal space, normalization, and masking of detector artifacts. Its modular architecture integrates tools for analyzing both powder diffraction patterns and single-crystal datasets, including advanced visualization features like 3D reciprocal space mapping and interactive scan inspection. By streamlining workflows and enhancing data interpretation, DMCPy empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of the DMC instrument for probing nuclear and magnetic structures in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Time-of-Flight Detector Values of Angular Streaking Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular streaking experiments enable for experimentation in the attosecond regions. However, the deployed Time-of-flight detectors are susceptible to noise and failure. These shortcomings make the outputs of the Time-of-flight detectors hard to understand for humans and further processing, such as for example the extraction of beam properties. In this article, we present an approach to remove high noise levels and reconstruct up to three failed Time-of-flight detectors from an arrangement of 16 Time-of-flight detectors. Due to its fast evaluation time, the presented method is applicable online during a running experiment. It is trained with simulation data, and we show the results of denoising and reconstruction of our method on real-world experiment data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will replace the current CMS Endcap Calorimeter during Long-Shutdown 3. The Endcap Concentrator (ECON) ASICs represent key elements in the readout chain, processing trigger (ECON-T) and data (ECON-D) streams from the HGCROC to the lpGBT. The ECONs will operate in a radiation environment with a High-Energy Hadron (${E\geq20MeV}$) flux up to $2\cdot10^{7} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. This contribution describes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)-based functional verification of the ECON ASICs focusing on the re-use of existing components to manage the complexity of the verification environment.</description>

      <title>Optimum filter-based analysis for the characterization of a high-resolution magnetic microcalorimeter towards the DELight experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-sensitive cryogenic calorimeters have become a favored technology with widespread application where eV-scale energy resolutions are needed. In this article, we characterize the performance of an X-ray magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) using a Fe-55 source. Employing an optimum filter-based amplitude estimation and energy reconstruction, we demonstrate that an unprecedented FWHM resolution of $\Delta E_\mathrm{FWHM} = \left(1.25\pm0.17\mathrm{\scriptsize{(stat)}}^{+0.05}_{-0.07}\mathrm{\scriptsize{(syst)}}\right)\,\text{eV}$ can be achieved. We also derive the best possible resolution and discuss limiting factors affecting the measurement. The analysis pipeline for the MMC data developed in this paper is furthermore an important step for the realization of the proposed superfluid helium-based experiment DELight, which will search for direct interaction of dark matter with masses below 100 MeV/c$^2$.</description>

      <title>Contribution of the light-collection non-uniformity to the energy resolution for the spaghetti-type calorimeter modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spaghetti-type calorimeters (SpaCal) are being considered as a potential solution for experiments at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).
  SpaCal modules consist of an absorber block with a matrix of holes filled with scintillating fibres. This geometry offers a flexible granularity. However, the total number of scintillating fibres per channel could exceed the available photocathode surface area, necessitating a light guide to efficiently collect and register the scintillating light from the scintillating fibres to a photomultiplier. The non-uniformities in the light collection would impact the energy resolution of the detector.
  In this study, the impact of the light collection non-uniformity on the energy resolution is estimated for the various geometries of light guides using optical simulations~(Geant4 simulation with optical photons). The study performed assuming a SpaCal prototype with $30\times 30$~mm$^2$ cell size and different photomultipliers with the following entrance windows: $18\times 18$~mm$^2$ (e.g. R7600), $9\times 9$~mm$^2$ (multi-anode version, e.g. R7600-M4), and a round photocathode $\oslash 8$~mm (e.g. R9880).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verification is a critical aspect of designing front-end (FE) readout ASICs for High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. These ASICs share several similar functional features, resulting in similar verification objectives, which can be addressed using comparable verification strategies. This contribution presents a set of re-usable verification components for addressing common verification tasks, such as clock generation, reset handling, configuration, as well as hit and fault injections. The components were developed as part of the CHIPS initiative and they have been successfully used in the verification of multiple HEP ASICs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of differential length oscillations of Fabry-Perot cavities provide a sensitive and promising approach to searching for scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM). The initial demonstration sets direct lower bounds that are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo, and a relaxion star bound to Earth -- ranging over a decade of ULDM mass and Compton frequency. The demonstration suggests how a much higher sensitivity to a much larger ULDM mass range can be obtained.</description>

Flux predictions for the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab were first published in 2009 by the MiniBooNE collaboration. It is no longer possible to run the simulation used to create these predictions due to outdated software versions. In this exciting period for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermilab, with both the far detector (ICARUS) and the near detector (SBND) operating, an updated flux model for the BNB is necessary. For the purpose of using a dynamic, up-to-date beam model, the SBN program has created a new simulation named G4BNB. This framework contains new features, such as a full neutrino ancestry to handle hadron production systematics with more precision, and the inclusion of neutral mesons from the proton-beryllium scatter to allow the study of exotic BSM scenarios.</description>
