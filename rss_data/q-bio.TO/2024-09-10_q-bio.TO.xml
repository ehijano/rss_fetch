      <title>Histopathological study on goldfish (Carassius auratus) gonads exposed to tobacco smoke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ornamental fish have various positive effects in human life. Due to the effect and importance of aesthetics and artificial reproduction of these fish, which may be enclosed in aquarium environments and come in contact with cigarette smoke, the effects of tobacco smoke on the gonad tissue of goldfish were investigated. For this purpose, 60 goldfish randomly (weight 100gr) divided in 3 groups and were released in tanks containing 10 liters of water (temperature: 20, hardness: 14 ppt, pH: 7/8). After adaptation, in treatment 1, 1gr of tobacco was heated daily with a direct flame, and the resulting smoke was collected and injected into water with an air pump, in treatment 2, this process was done twice a day. After 3 months, fish gonads tissue were sampled and histopathological slides were investigated. The results showed that in the treatment 2, there were early and immature oocytes in the ovarian tissue in comparison to other groups. Also, in the testes of fish of treatment 2, the reduction of spermatozoids and the higher number of spermatogonia were observed. In the treatment 3, these changes were more. A significant difference between the groups in both female and male was observed at the sexual maturation stages (P&lt;0.001). Based on this study, the dissolution of tobacco smoke can have a negative effect on the process of sexual reproduction and fish exposed to more smoke are more likely to be sterile, and these changes were observed in both males and female.</description>

      <title>Celcomen: spatial causal disentanglement for single-cell and tissue perturbation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celcomen leverages a mathematical causality framework to disentangle intra- and inter- cellular gene regulation programs in spatial transcriptomics and single-cell data through a generative graph neural network. It can learn gene-gene interactions, as well as generate post-perturbation counterfactual spatial transcriptomics, thereby offering access to experimentally inaccessible samples. We validated its disentanglement, identifiability, and counterfactual prediction capabilities through simulations and in clinically relevant human glioblastoma, human fetal spleen, and mouse lung cancer samples. Celcomen provides the means to model disease and therapy induced changes allowing for new insights into single-cell spatially resolved tissue responses relevant to human health.</description>
