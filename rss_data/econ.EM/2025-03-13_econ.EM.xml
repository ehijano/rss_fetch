      <title>On the Wisdom of Crowds (of Economists)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of macroeconomic survey forecast response averages as the number of survey respondents grows. Such averages are "portfolios" of forecasts. We characterize the speed and pattern of the gains from diversification and their eventual decrease with portfolio size (the number of survey respondents) in both (1) the key real-world data-based environment of the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), and (2) the theoretical model-based environment of equicorrelated forecast errors. We proceed by proposing and comparing various direct and model-based "crowd size signature plots," which summarize the forecasting performance of k-average forecasts as a function of k, where k is the number of forecasts in the average. We then estimate the equicorrelation model for growth and inflation forecast errors by choosing model parameters to minimize the divergence between direct and model-based signature plots. The results indicate near-perfect equicorrelation model fit for both growth and inflation, which we explicate by showing analytically that, under conditions, the direct and fitted equicorrelation model-based signature plots are identical at a particular model parameter configuration, which we characterize. We find that the gains from diversification are greater for inflation forecasts than for growth forecasts, but that both gains nevertheless decrease quite quickly, so that fewer SPF respondents than currently used may be adequate.</description>

      <title>A nested nonparametric logit model for microtransit revenue management supplemented with citywide synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an IT-enabled multi-passenger mobility service, microtransit can improve accessibility, reduce congestion, and enhance flexibility. However, its heterogeneous impacts across travelers necessitate better tools for microtransit forecasting and revenue management, especially when actual usage data are limited. We propose a nested nonparametric model for joint travel mode and ride pass subscription choice, estimated using marginal subscription data and synthetic populations. The model improves microtransit choice modeling by (1) leveraging citywide synthetic data for greater spatiotemporal granularity, (2) employing an agent-based estimation approach to capture heterogeneous user preferences, and (3) integrating mode choice parameters into subscription choice modeling. We apply our methodology to a case study in Arlington, TX, using synthetic data from Replica Inc. and microtransit data from Via. Our model accurately predicts the number of subscribers in the upper branch and achieves a high McFadden R2 in the lower branch (0.603 for weekday trips and 0.576 for weekend trips), while also retrieving interpretable elasticities and consumer surplus. We further integrate the model into a simulation-based framework for microtransit revenue management. For the ride pass pricing policy, our simulation results show that reducing the price of the weekly pass ($25 -&gt; $18.9) and monthly pass ($80 -&gt; $71.5) would surprisingly increase total revenue by $127 per day. For the subsidy policy, our simulation results show that a 100% fare discount would reduce 61 car trips to AT&amp;T Stadium for a game event, and increase 82 microtransit trips to Medical City Arlington, but require subsidies of $533 per event and $483 per day, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Counterfactuals and the Epistemology of Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics recognized an epistemology of causal inference based on the Rubin causal model (Rubin 1974), which merits broader attention in philosophy. This model, in fact, presupposes a logical principle of counterfactuals, Conditional Excluded Middle (CEM), the locus of a pivotal debate between Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973) on the semantics of counterfactuals. Proponents of CEM should recognize that this connection points to a new argument for CEM -- a Quine-Putnam indispensability argument grounded in the Nobel-winning applications of the Rubin model in health and social sciences. To advance the dialectic, I challenge this argument with an updated Rubin causal model that retains its successes while dispensing with CEM. This novel approach combines the strengths of the Rubin causal model and a causal model familiar in philosophy, the causal Bayes net. The takeaway: deductive logic and inductive inference, often studied in isolation, are deeply interconnected.</description>
