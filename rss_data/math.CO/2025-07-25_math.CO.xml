      <title>New results on the Wiener index of trees with a given diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Wiener index of a class of trees with fixed diameter and order. A double broom is a tree such that there exist two vertices $u$ and $v$, such that each leaf of $T$ is adjacent to $u$ or $v$. We prove that for a tree $T$ of diameter $d$ and (sufficiently large) order $n$ such that $n\leq d-2+4 \left\lfloor \sqrt{ \frac{d-1}{2}} \right\rfloor$, $T$ has maximum Wiener index (in the class of trees of diameter $d$ and order $n$) if and only if $T$ is a double broom. Our results are sharp up to a small constant.</description>

      <title>A complete $t$-intersection theorem for families of spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal T_n$ denote the set of all labelled spanning trees of $K_n$. A family $\mathcal F \subset \mathcal T_n$ is $t$-intersecting if for all $A, B \in \mathcal F$ the trees $A$ and $B$ share at least $t$ edges. In this paper, we determine for $n&gt;n_0$ the size of the largest $t$-intersecting family $\mathcal F\subset \mathcal T_n$ for all meaningful values of $t$ ($t\le n-1$). This result is a rare instance when a complete $t$-intersection theorem for a given type of structures is known.</description>

      <title>On ascent sequences avoiding 021 and a pattern of length four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ascent sequences of length $n$ avoiding the pattern $021$ are enumerated by the $n$-th Catalan number $C_n=\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$. In this paper, we extend this result and enumerate ascent sequences avoiding $\{021,\tau\}$, where $\tau$ is a pattern of length four. We in turn identify all of the corresponding Wilf-equivalence classes and find generating function formulas corresponding to each class. In a couple of cases, we make use of an auxiliary statistic and the kernel method to ascertain the generating function. In several cases, our work of enumeration is shortened by establishing the equivalence of $\{021,\tau\}$- and $\{021,\tau'\}$-avoiders of a given length through an explicit bijection. As a consequence of our results, one obtains new combinatorial interpretations in terms of ascent sequences for several of the entries in the OEIS.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic construction of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of near-factorizations of finite groups dates back to the 1950s. Recently, this topic has attracted renewed attention, and the concept has been extended to $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, in which each non-identity group element appears exactly $\lambda \ge 1$ times. This paper presents a cyclotomic construction of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations in the cyclic group $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p = 4n^4 + 12n^2 + 1$ is prime for $n \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Counting $k$-cycles in $5$-connected planar triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex $5$-connected planar triangulation has at most $9n-50$ many cycles of length $5$ for all $n\ge 20$ and this upper bound is tight. We also show that for every $k\geq 6$, there exists some constant $C(k)$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex $5$-connected planar graph has at most $C(k) \cdot n^{\lfloor{k/3}\rfloor}$ many cycles of length $k$. This upper bound is asymptotically tight for all $k\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Ordered trees and the Geode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work of Wildberger and Rubine, it is shown that the formal power series $\mathbf{S}$ in the variables $t_1,t_2,\dots$ satisfying $\mathbf{S}=1+\sum_{n\geq 1} t_n\mathbf{S}^n$ has a factorisation $\mathbf{S}=1+(t_1+t_2+\cdots)\mathbf{G}$, where $\mathbf{G}$ is a power series with nonnegative coefficients called the Geode. In this note we give a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients of $\mathbf{G}$ based on ordered trees. This amends the statement of a disproved conjecture of Wildberger and Rubine which suggests a similar (but incorrect) interpretation.</description>

      <title>Edge-connectivity of graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature and amply regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sharp edge-connectivity estimate for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature. This leads to a geometric criterion for the existence of a perfect matching. Precisely, we show that any regular graph with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature and an even or infinite number of vertices has a perfect matching. Through a synthesis of combinatorial and curvature-related techniques, we determine the edge-connectivity of (possibly infinite) amply regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Rowmotion and Echelonmotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a linear extension $\sigma$ of a finite poset $R$, we consider the permutation matrix indexing the Schubert cell containing the Cartan matrix of $R$ with respect to $\sigma$. This yields a bijection $\mathrm{Ech}_\sigma\colon R\to R$ that we call echelonmotion; it is the inverse of the Coxeter permutation studied by Kl\'asz, Marczinzik, and Thomas. Those authors proved that echelonmotion agrees with rowmotion when $R$ is a distributive lattice. We generalize this result to semidistributive lattices. In addition, we prove that every trim lattice has a linear extension with respect to which echelonmotion agrees with rowmotion. We also show that echelonmotion on an Eulerian poset (with respect to any linear extension) is an involution. Finally, we initiate the study of echelon-independent posets, which are posets for which echelonmotion is independent of the chosen linear extension. We prove that a lattice is echelon-independent if and only if it is semidistributive. Moreover, we show that echelon-independent connected posets are bounded and have semidistributive MacNeille completions.</description>

      <title>The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number: complexity and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices $X\subseteq V(G)$ is a $d$-distance dominating set if for every $u\in V(G)\setminus X$ there exists $x\in X$ such that $d(u,x) \le d$, and $X$ is a $p$-packing if $d(u,v) \ge p+1$ for every different $u,v\in X$. The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number $\gamma_d^p(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ which is both a $d$-distance dominating set and a $p$-packing. It is proved that for every two fixed integers $d$ and $p$ with $2 \le d$ and $0 \le p \leq 2d-1$, the decision problem whether $\gamma_d^p(G) \leq k$ holds is NP-complete for bipartite planar graphs. For a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices with $\ell$ leaves and $s$ support vertices it is proved that (i) $\gamma_2^0(T) \geq \frac{n-\ell-s+4}{5}$, (ii) $\left \lceil \frac{n-\ell-s+4}{5} \right \rceil \leq \gamma_2^2(T) \leq \left \lfloor \frac{n+3s-1}{5} \right \rfloor$, and if $d \geq 2$, then (iii) $\gamma_d^2(T) \leq \frac{n-2\sqrt{n}+d+1}{d}$. Inequality (i) improves an earlier bound due to Meierling and Volkmann, and independently Raczek, Lema\'nska, and Cyman, while (iii) extends an earlier result for $\gamma_2^2(T)$ due to Henning. Sharpness of the bounds are discussed and established in most cases. It is also proved that every connected graph $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ such that $\gamma_2^2(T) \leq \gamma_2^2(G)$.</description>

      <title>On $k$-coalition in graphs: bounds and exact values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=\big{(}V(G),E(G)\big{)}$, a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a $k$-dominating set if every vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\subset V(G)$ form a $k$-coalition in $G$ if neither set is a $k$-dominating set in $G$ but their union $A\cup B$ is a $k$-dominating set. A partition $\Omega$ of $V(G)$ is a $k$-coalition partition if each set in $\Omega$ is either a $k$-dominating set of cardinality $k$ or forms a $k$-coalition with another set in $\Omega$. The $k$-coalition number $C_{k}(G)$ equals the maximum cardinality of a $k$-coalition partition of $G$. In this work, we give general upper and lower bounds on this parameter. In particular, we show that if $G$ has minimum degree $\delta \ge 2$ and maximum degree $\Delta \ge 4 \lfloor \delta/2 \rfloor$, then $C_{2}(G) \leq (\Delta-2\lfloor \delta/2 \rfloor+1)(\lfloor \delta/2 \rfloor+1) + \lceil \delta/2 \rceil+1$, and this bound is sharp. If $T$ is a tree of order~$n \ge 2$, then we prove the upper bound $C_{2}(T) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\big\rfloor+1$ and we characterize the extremal trees achieving equality in this bound. We determine the exact value of $C_{k}(G)$ for any cubic graph $G$ and $k\geq2$. Finally, we give the exact value of $C_{k}$ for any complete bipartite graph, which completes a partial result and resolves an issue from an earlier paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaetz, Pechenik, Pfannerer, Striker, and Swanson introduced the concept of hourglass plabic graphs and provided a method for computing web diagrams and invariants corresponding to $4\times n$ Young tableaux, while Elkin, Musiker, and Wright applied Lam's method to explicitly compute the webs compatible with cluster variables in Gr(3,n) and their twists, namely, the preimages of the immanant map introduced by Fraser, Lam, and Le. In this paper, we use these two methods to compute both the web diagrams and the dual webs corresponding to quadratic and cubic cluster variables in the Grassmannian cluster algebra C[Gr(4,8)].</description>

      <title>Guessing sequences of eigenvectors for LMPs defining spectrahedral relaxations of Eulerian rigidly convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable multivariate Eulerian polynomials were introduced by Br\"and\'en. Particularizing some variables, it is possible to extract real zero multivariate Eulerian polynomials from them. These real zero multivariate Eulerian polynomials can be fed into constructions of spectrahedral relaxations providing therefore approximations to the (Eulerian) rigidly convex sets defined by these polynomials. The accuracy of these approximations is measured through the behaviour in the diagonal, where the usual univariate Eulerian polynomials sit. In particular, in this sense, the accuracy of the global spectrahedral approximation produced by the spectrahedral relaxation can be measured in terms of bounds for the extreme roots of univariate Eulerian polynomials. The bounds thus obtained beat the previous bounds found in the literature. However, the bound explicitly studied and obtained before beat the previously known bounds by a quantity going to $0$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Here we use numerical experiments to construct a sequence of vectors providing a (linearized) bound whose difference with the previous known bounds is a growing exponential function (going therefore fast to infinity when $n$ grows). This allows us to establish a better (diagonal) measure of accuracy for the spectrahedral relaxation of the Eulerian rigidly convex sets. In particular, we will achieve this by linearizing through the sequence of vectors $\{(y,(-2^{m-i})_{i=3}^{m},(0,\frac{1}{2}),(1)_{i=1}^{m})\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ for even $n=2m$.</description>

      <title>Perfect divisibility of $(P_2\cup P_4,\mbox{bull})$-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, the vertex set $V(H)$ admits a partition $(A, B)$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. We prove that every ($P_2\cup P_4$, bull)-free graph $G$ with $\omega(G)\geq3$ is perfectly divisible hence the chromatic number satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\binom{\omega(G)+1}{2}$. The clique-number condition is tight: counterexamples exist for $\omega(G)=2$. Additionally, we provide a short proof of the perfect divisibility of ($P_5$, bull)-free graphs, originally established by Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019), 54-60.].</description>

      <title>Stability of $2$-domination number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the stability of the $2$-domination number in simple undirected graphs. The $2$-domination number of a graph $G$, $\gamma_2(G)$, represents the minimum size of a vertex subset where every other vertex in the graph is adjacent to at least two members of the subset. We define the $2$-domination stability, $st_{\gamma_2}(G)$, as the smallest number of vertices whose removal causes a change in $\gamma_2(G)$. Our primary contributions include computing this parameter for specific graphs, establishing various bounds for this stability and determining its behavior under certain graph operations combining two graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for all integers $2\leq t\leq cn$, if $\calA$ is a collection of spanning trees in $K_n$ such that any two intersect at at least $t$ edges, then $|\calA|\leq 2^tn^{n-t-2}$. This bound is tight; the equality is achieved when $\calA$ is a collection of spanning trees containing a fixed $t$ disjoint edges. This is an improvement of a result by Frankl, Hurlbert, Ihringer, Kupavskii, Lindzey, Meagher, and Pantagi, who proved such a result for $t=O\left(\frac n{\log n}\right)$.</description>

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated conjecturing system \texttt{TxGraffiti}. Each conjecture is concise, grounded in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of mathematical thought.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of $q$-deformed unitary ensembles with the Al-Salam--Carlitz weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformed random unitary ensembles associated with the weight function of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials, indexed by a parameter $a &lt; 0$. In the special case $a = -1$, the model reduces to the $q$-deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble. Employing the Flajolet--Viennot theory together with the combinatorics of matchings, we derive an explicit positive-sum expression for the spectral moments. In the double-scaling regime $q = e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ denotes the ensemble size and $\lambda &gt; 0$ is fixed, we derive the first two terms in the large-$N$ expansion of the spectral moments. As a consequence, we obtain a closed-form expression for the limiting spectral density. Notably, this density exhibits two successive phase transitions as $\lambda$ increases, characterised by a reduction in the number of soft edges from two, to one, and eventually to none. Furthermore, we show that the limiting density coincides with the limiting zero distribution of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials under the same scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of properties of a statistical physics model to slight perturbations in the exact local interactions of the model is a very relevant philosophical question, considering real-life measurements on which we base some models can only ever reach a finite precision. In this article, we will discuss this topic in a formal mathematical setting, and notably exhibit a family of models for which the low-temperature behaviour is highly non-robust.</description>

Abstract: Permutative automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$ are in bijection with the stable permutations of $[n]^t$. They are also the elements of the reduced Weyl group of $Aut(\mathcal{O}_n)$. In this paper, we characterize the stability of transpositions in $S([n]^3)$, and thus providing a new family (with $6$ degrees of freedom) of automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$ for any $n&gt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</description>

Abstract: We offer a new structural basis for the theory of 3-connected graphs, providing a unique decomposition of every such graph into parts that are either quasi 4-connected, wheels, or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and has the following applications: we obtain a new theorem characterising all finite Cayley graphs as either essentially 4-connected, cycles, or complete graphs on at most four vertices, and we provide an automatic proof of Tutte's wheel theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we define a novel edit distance for trees considered with some abstract weights on the edges. The metric is driven by the idea of considering trees as topological summaries in the context of persistence and topological data analysis. Several examples related to persistent sets are presented. The metric can be computed with a dynamical binary linear programming approach. This framework is applied and further studied in other works focused on merge trees, where the problems of stability and merge trees estimation are also assessed.</description>

Abstract: For an $n$-tuple $s$ of non-negative integers, the $s$-weak order is a lattice structure on $s$-trees, generalizing the weak order on permutations. We first describe the join irreducible elements, the canonical join representations, and the forcing order of the $s$-weak order in terms of combinatorial objects, generalizing the arcs, the non-crossing arc diagrams, and the subarc order for the weak order. We then extend the theory of shards and shard polytopes to construct geometric realizations of the $s$-weak order and all its lattice quotients as polyhedral complexes, generalizing the quotient fans and quotientopes of the weak order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i &lt; 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k &gt; 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</description>

Abstract: We study the topological persistence of the (path) configuration spaces and the (path) independence complexes for digraphs as well as for their underlying graphs. We prove some canonical embeddings from the (path) independence complexes of the underlying graphs to the (path) independence complexes of the digraphs as well as some canonical embeddings between the (path) independence complexes induced by strong totally geodesic immersions and strong totally geodesic embeddings of (di)graphs. We apply the path complexes and the path homology to the path independence complexes of (di)graphs. As by-products, we derive some consequences about the Shannon capacities.</description>

Abstract: We describe an explicit geometric construction of a vast family of graphs without $m$-cliques with bounded independence number generalizing triangle-free Ramsey graphs described by Codenotti, Pudl\'ak and Resta and provide a new combinatorial proof for the upper bound on the independence number of the latter. We focus on triangle-free graphs and describe some families of such graphs with $n$ vertices and independence number $O(n^{\frac{2}{3}})$ which give us a constructive asymptotic lower bound $\Omega(t^{\frac{3}{2}})$ for Ramsey numbers $R(3, t)$ which achieves the best-known constructive lower bound. We describe an additional family of graphs that don't match the best-known bound but still have a polynomial independence number with regards to the number of vertices and are based on Euclidean geometry. We also present a linear $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for finding the largest independent set that works for a significant subset of our family of graphs.</description>

Abstract: For a tree $T$, let $lp(T)$ be the number of different lengths of leaf to leaf paths in $T$. For a degree sequence $s$ of a tree, let ${\rm rad}(s)$ be the minimum radius of a tree with degree sequence $s$. Recently, Di Braccio, Katsamaktsis, Ma, Malekshahian, and Zhao provided a lower bound on $lp(T)$ in terms of the number of leaves and the maximum degree of $T$, answering a related question posed by Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szab\'o. Here we show $lp(T)\geq {\rm rad}(s)-\log_2\left({\rm rad}(s)\right)$ for a tree $T$ with no vertex of degree $2$ and degree sequence $s$, and discuss possible improvements and variants.</description>

Abstract: The theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies is a generalization of that of Newton polytopes for toric varieties, and it gives a systematic method of constructing toric degenerations of projective varieties. In this paper, we study Newton-Okounkov bodies of Schubert varieties from the theory of cluster algebras. We construct Newton-Okounkov bodies using specific valuations which generalize extended g-vectors in cluster theory, and discuss how these bodies are related to string polytopes and Nakashima-Zelevinsky polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algebra of elliptic commuting variables involving a base $q$, nome $p$, and $2r$ noncommuting variables. This algebra, which for $r=1$ reduces to an algebra considered earlier by the author, is an elliptic extension of the well-known algebra of $r$ $q$-commuting variables. We present a multinomial theorem valid as an identity in this algebra, hereby extending the author's previously obtained elliptic binomial theorem to higher rank. Two essential ingredients are a consistency relation satisfied by the elliptic weights and the Weierstrass type $\mathsf A$ elliptic partial fraction decomposition. From the elliptic multinomial theorem we obtain, by convolution, an identity equivalent to Rosengren's type $\mathsf A$ extension of the Frenkel-Turaev ${}_{10}V_9$ summation. Interpreted in terms of a weighted counting of lattice paths in the integer lattice $\mathbb Z^r$, this derivation of Rosengren's $\mathsf A_r$ Frenkel-Turaev summation constitutes the first combinatorial proof of that fundamental identity.</description>

      <title>On the Alexander polynomial of special alternating links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Alexander polynomial (1928) is the first polynomial invariant of links devised to help distinguish links up to isotopy. Fox's conjecture (1962) -- stating that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial for any alternating link are trapezoidal -- was settled for special alternating links by the present authors (2023); K\'alm\'an, the second author, and Postnikov gave an alternative proof (2025). The present paper is a study of the special combinatorial and discrete geometric properties that Alexander polynomials of special alternating links possess along with a generalization to all Eulerian graphs, introduced by Murasugi and Stoimenow (2003). We prove that the Murasugi and Stoimenow generalized Alexander polynomials can be expressed in terms of volumes of root polytopes of unimodular matrices. The latter generalizes a result regarding the Alexander polynomials of special alternating links that follows by putting together the work of Li and Postnikov (2013) and K\'alm\'an, the second author, and Postnikov (2025). Furthermore, we conjecture a generalization of Fox's conjecture to the generalized Alexander polynomials of Murasugi and Stoimenow and bijectively relate two longstanding combinatorial models for the Alexander polynomials of special alternating links: Crowell's state model (1959) and Kauffman's state model (1982, 2006).</description>

      <title>The pinning ideal of a multiloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multiloop $\gamma\colon \sqcup_1^s \mathbb{S}^1 \looparrowright \mathbb{F}$ is a generic immersion of a finite union of circles into an oriented surface, considered up to homeomorphisms. A pinning set is a set of points $P\subset \mathbb{F}\setminus \operatorname{im}(\gamma)$, such that in the punctured surface $\mathbb{F} \setminus P$, the immersion $\gamma$ has the minimal number of double points in its homotopy class. The collection of pinning sets of $\gamma$ forms a poset under inclusion called the pinning ideal $\mathcal{PI}(\gamma)$ which is endowed with the cardinal function whose minimum defines the pinning number $\varpi(\gamma)$.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a multiloop is \textsf{NP}-complete, even for loops in the sphere. We give two proofs that it is \textsf{NP}: First, we implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a point-set is pinning, adapting methods of Birman--Series and Cohen--Lustig for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. Second, for loops in the sphere we reduce the problem in polynomial time to a variant of boolean satisfiability by applying a theorem of Hass--Scott characterizing taut loops, and adapting algorithms of Blank and Shor--Van Wyk which decide when a curve in the plane bounds an immersed disc. To show that it is \textsf{NP}-hard we reduce the vertex cover problem for graphs to the pinning problem for plane loops.
  We use our algorithms to compute the pinning ideals for $\approx 1000$ of the smallest multiloops in the sphere, available in the online catalog LooPindex.</description>

      <title>Limit profile for the transpose top-2 with random shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians -- spherical and hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete Laplacian on Euclidean triangulated surfaces is a well-established notion. We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and hyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to the Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain combinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is Delaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in several respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written in terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose expression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the usual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete conformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \in \{-1,1\}$ are $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth setting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of the vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the $-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron inscribed into corresponding quadrics.</description>

      <title>Topographs for binary quadratic forms and class numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, in greater detail than before, J.H. Conway's topographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane with regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can display the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of forms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence class representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction for complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative, square or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class number formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three squares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give evaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a topograph.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Supersimplicity and arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main motivation for this article is to explore the connections between the existence of certain combinatorial patterns (as in van der Corputs's theorem on arithmetic progressions of length $3$) with well-known tools and theorems for definable groups in simple theories. In the last sections of this article, we apply our model-theoretic results to bound the number of initial points starting few arithmetic progression of length $3$ in the structure of the additive group of integers with a predicate for the prime integers, assuming Dickson's conjecture, or with a predicate for the square-free integers, as well as for asymptotic limits of finite fields. Our techniques yield similar results for the elements appearing as distances in skew-corners and for S\'ark\"ozy's theorem.</description>
