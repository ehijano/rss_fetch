      <title>An AI Implementation Science Study to Improve Trustworthy Data in a Large Healthcare System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked interest in Trustworthy AI and AI Implementation Science, both of which are essential for accelerating clinical adoption. However, strict regulations, gaps between research and clinical settings, and challenges in evaluating AI systems continue to hinder real-world implementation. This study presents an AI implementation case study within Shriners Childrens (SC), a large multisite pediatric system, showcasing the modernization of SCs Research Data Warehouse (RDW) to OMOP CDM v5.4 within a secure Microsoft Fabric environment. We introduce a Python-based data quality assessment tool compatible with SCs infrastructure, extending OHDsi's R/Java-based Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) and integrating Trustworthy AI principles using the METRIC framework. This extension enhances data quality evaluation by addressing informative missingness, redundancy, timeliness, and distributional consistency. We also compare systematic and case-specific AI implementation strategies for Craniofacial Microsomia (CFM) using the FHIR standard. Our contributions include a real-world evaluation of AI implementations, integration of Trustworthy AI principles into data quality assessment, and insights into hybrid implementation strategies that blend systematic infrastructure with use-case-driven approaches to advance AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>The BEAT-CF Causal Model: A model for guiding the design of trials and observational analyses of cystic fibrosis exacerbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) occurs progressively, punctuated by acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in which abrupt declines in lung function are not fully recovered. A key component of CF management over the past half century has been the treatment of PEx to slow lung function decline. This has been credited with improvements in survival for people with CF (PwCF), but there is no consensus on the optimal approach to PEx management. BEAT-CF (Bayesian evidence-adaptive treatment of CF) was established to build an evidence-informed knowledge base for CF management. The BEAT-CF causal model is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and Bayesian network (BN) for PEx that aims to inform the design and analysis of clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of alternative approaches to PEx management. The causal model describes relationships between background risk factors, treatments, and pathogen colonisation of the airways that affect the outcome of an individual PEx episode. The key factors, outcomes, and causal relationships were elicited from CF clinical experts and together represent current expert understanding of the pathophysiology of a PEx episode, guiding the design of data collection and studies and enabling causal inference. Here, we present the DAG that documents this understanding, along with the processes used in its development, providing transparency around our trial design and study processes, as well as a reusable framework for others.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bayesian Inference: The Correlation Integral Likelihood Framework and Gradient Flow Methods for Deterministic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating mathematical models of biological processes is essential for achieving predictive accuracy and gaining mechanistic insight. However, this task remains challenging due to limited and noisy data, significant biological variability, and the computational complexity of the models themselves. In this method's article, we explore a range of approaches for parameter inference in partial differential equation (PDE) models of biological systems. We introduce a unified mathematical framework, the Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL) method, for parameter estimation in systems exhibiting heterogeneous or chaotic dynamics, encompassing both pattern formation models and individual-based models. Departing from classical Bayesian inverse problem methodologies, we motivate the development of the CIL method, demonstrate its versatility, and highlight illustrative applications within mathematical biology. Furthermore, we compare stochastic sampling strategies, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with deterministic gradient flow approaches, highlighting how these methods can be integrated within the proposed framework to enhance inference performance. Our work provides a practical and theoretically grounded toolbox for researchers seeking to calibrate complex biological models using incomplete, noisy, or heterogeneous data, thereby advancing both the predictive capability and mechanistic understanding of such systems.</description>

      <title>SpikGPT: A High-Accuracy and Interpretable Spiking Attention Framework for Single-Cell Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable cell type annotation remains a challenge in single-cell transcriptomics, especially when datasets exhibit strong batch effects or contain previously unseen cell populations. Here we introduce SpikGPT, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates scGPT-derived cell embeddings with a spiking Transformer architecture to achieve efficient and robust annotation. scGPT provides biologically informed dense representations of each cell, which are further processed by a multi-head Spiking Self-Attention mechanism for energy-efficient feature extraction. Across multiple benchmark datasets, SpikGPT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of leading annotation tools. Notably, SpikGPT uniquely identifies unseen cell types by assigning low-confidence predictions to an "Unknown" category, allowing accurate rejection of cell states absent from the training reference. Together, these results demonstrate that SpikGPT is a versatile and reliable annotation tool capable of generalizing across datasets, resolving complex cellular heterogeneity, and facilitating discovery of novel or disease-associated cell populations.</description>

      <title>Learning From Limited Data and Feedback for Cell Culture Process Monitoring: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cell culture bioprocessing, real-time batch process monitoring (BPM) refers to the continuous tracking and analysis of key process variables such as viable cell density, nutrient levels, metabolite concentrations, and product titer throughout the duration of a batch run. This enables early detection of deviations and supports timely control actions to ensure optimal cell growth and product quality. BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability. The results also suggest that integrating Raman-based predictions with lagged offline measurements enhances monitoring accuracy, offering a promising direction for future bioprocess soft sensor development.</description>

      <title>Cell-cell communication inference and analysis: biological mechanisms, computational approaches, and future opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multicellular organisms, cells coordinate their activities through cell-cell communication (CCC), which are crucial for development, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial omics technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to systematically infer and analyze CCC from these omics data, either by integrating prior knowledge of ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs) or through de novo approaches. A variety of computational methods have been developed, focusing on methodological innovations, accurate modeling of complex signaling mechanisms, and investigation of broader biological questions. These advances have greatly enhanced our ability to analyze CCC and generate biological hypotheses. Here, we introduce the biological mechanisms and modeling strategies of CCC, and provide a focused overview of more than 140 computational methods for inferring CCC from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, emphasizing the diversity in methodological frameworks and biological questions. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Leveraging topological data analysis to estimate bone strength from micro-CT as a surrogate for advanced imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate bone strength prediction is essential for assessing fracture risk, particularly in aging populations and individuals with osteoporosis. Bone imaging has evolved from X-rays and DXA to clinical computed tomography (CT), and now to advanced modalities such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT and synchrotron radiation CT, which offer unprecedented resolution of bone microarchitecture. However, analytical methods have not kept pace with these imaging advances. This study applied topological data analysis (TDA) to extract biomechanically relevant features from high-resolution bone images, offering a new framework for bone strength prediction. We extracted topological features, specifically those derived from persistent homology, and combined them with standard bone morphometric descriptors to train machine learning models for apparent strength prediction. Models based solely on topological features outperformed those using traditional morphometrics, highlighting TDA's ability to capture biomechanically relevant structure. In particular, internal voids, often dismissed as imaging noise, proved to be the most predictive. While limited by dataset size and class imbalance, these results suggest that TDA offers a promising approach for advancing osteoporosis risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Inference on Mechanisms of Network Growth and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic models can provide an intuitive and interpretable explanation of network growth by specifying a set of generative rules. These rules can be defined by domain knowledge about real-world mechanisms governing network growth or may be designed to facilitate the appearance of certain network motifs. In the formation of real-world networks, multiple mechanisms may be simultaneously involved; it is then important to understand the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the use of a conditional density estimator, augmented with a graph neural network, to perform inference on a flexible mixture of network-forming mechanisms. This event-wise mixture-of-mechanisms model assigns mechanisms to each edge formation event rather than stipulating node-level mechanisms, thus allowing for an explanation of the network generation process, as well as the dynamic evolution of the network over time. We demonstrate that our approximate Bayesian approach yields valid inferences for the relative weights of the mechanisms in our model, and we utilize this method to investigate the mechanisms behind the formation of a variety of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>In Silico Functional Profiling of Engineered Small Molecules: A Machine Learning Approach Leveraging PubChem Identifiers (CID_SID ML model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article introduces a concept for a time- and cost-effective methodological framework leveraging machine learning (ML) models for both early-stage drug development and clinical trial support. The rationale for this approach is the inherent scalability and speed enabled by using pre-calculated data embedded in existing PubChem identifiers (CID and SID), thereby eliminating the computationally intensive step of on-the-fly molecular descriptor generation. The approach was effectively demonstrated across four diverse bioassays: antagonists of the human D3 dopamine receptor, Rab9 promoter activators, small-molecule inhibitors of CHOP, and antagonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor. A comparison, based on Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), was conducted between the CID_SID ML model, the MORGAN2-based ML model, and the RDKit-transformed SMILES model for these four case studies, revealing that no method is universally superior in terms of performance. Furthermore, the CID_SID model averaged a rapid execution time of only 3.3 seconds; the ML models relying on explicit structural descriptors, such as MORGAN2 and RDKit-transformed SMILES, demonstrated high computational costs, with processing times averaging 106.0 and 109.6 seconds, respectively. While negligible for a single ML model, these times would cause a significant difference in computational resource consumption when scaled across a framework involving over a million buildings. Moreover, the CID_SID ML model achieved strong average performance metrics: Accuracy of 83.52%, Precision of 89.62%, Recall of 75.65%, F1-Score of 81.93% and ROC of 83.53%.</description>

      <title>Look mom, no experimental data! Learning to score protein-ligand interactions from simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in protein-ligand structure prediction, deep learning methods remain limited in their ability to accurately predict binding affinities, particularly for novel protein targets dissimilar from the training set. In contrast, physics-based binding free energy calculations offer high accuracy across chemical space but are computationally prohibitive for large-scale screening. We propose a hybrid approach that approximates the accuracy of physics-based methods by training target-specific neural networks on molecular dynamics simulations of the protein in complex with random small molecules. Our method uses force matching to learn an implicit free energy landscape of ligand binding for each target. Evaluated on six proteins, our approach achieves competitive virtual screening performance using 100-500 $\mu$s of MD simulations per target. Notably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art early enrichment when using the true pose for active compounds. These results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning for virtual screening on novel targets.

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

      <title>ConfRover: Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.

      <title>PixCell: A generative foundation model for digital histopathology images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, there are unique problems in pathology, such as annotated data scarcity, privacy regulations in data sharing, and inherently generative tasks like virtual staining. Generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address these problems through image synthesis. We introduce PixCell, the first generative foundation model for histopathology images. PixCell is a diffusion model trained on PanCan-30M, a large, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H&amp;E-stained whole slide images of various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any human-annotated data. By conditioning on real slides, the synthetic images capture the properties of the real data and can be used as data augmentation for small-scale datasets to boost classification performance. We prove the foundational versatility of PixCell by applying it to two generative downstream tasks: privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and virtual IHC staining. PixCell's high-fidelity conditional generation enables institutions to use their private data to synthesize highly realistic, site-specific surrogate images that can be shared in place of raw patient data. Furthermore, using datasets of roughly paired H&amp;E-IHC tiles, we learn to translate PixCell's conditioning from H&amp;E to multiple IHC stains, allowing the generation of IHC images from H&amp;E inputs. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</description>
