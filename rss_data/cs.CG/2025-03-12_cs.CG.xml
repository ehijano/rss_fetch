      <title>Algorithms for Distance Problems in Continuous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing the diameter and the mean distance of a continuous graph, i.e., a connected graph where all points along the edges, instead of only the vertices, must be taken into account. It is known that for continuous graphs with $m$ edges these values can be computed in roughly $O(m^2)$ time. In this paper, we use geometric techniques to obtain subquadratic time algorithms to compute the diameter and the mean distance of a continuous graph for two well-established classes of sparse graphs. We show that the diameter and the mean distance of a continuous graph of treewidth at most $k$ can be computed in $O(n\log^{O(k)} n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. We also show that computing the diameter and mean distance of a continuous planar graph with $n$ vertices and $F$ faces takes $O(n F \log n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Crossing Number of 3-Plane Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 3-plane drawings, that is, drawings of graphs in which every edge has at most three crossings. We show how the recently developed Density Formula for topological drawings of graphs (KKKRSU GD 2024) can be used to count the crossings in terms of the number $n$ of vertices. As a main result, we show that every 3-plane drawing has at most $5.5(n-2)$ crossings, which is tight. In particular, it follows that every 3-planar graph on $n$ vertices has crossing number at most $5.5n$, which improves upon a recent bound (BBBDHKMOW GD 2024) of $6.6n$. To apply the Density Formula, we carefully analyze the interplay between certain configurations of cells in a 3-plane drawing. As a by-product, we also obtain an alternative proof for the known statement that every 3-planar graph has at most $5.5(n-2)$ edges.</description>
