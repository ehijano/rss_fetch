      <title>Optimising task allocation to balance business goals and worker well-being for financial service workforces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Financial service companies manage huge volumes of data which requires timely error identification and resolution. The associated tasks to resolve these errors frequently put financial analyst workforces under significant pressure leading to resourcing challenges and increased business risk. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal task allocation model which considers both business orientated goals and analyst well-being.
  Methodology: We use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise our formal model to allocate and schedule tasks to analysts. The proposed solution is able to allocate tasks to analysts with appropriate skills and experience, while taking into account staff well-being objectives.
  Findings: We demonstrate our GA model outperforms baseline heuristics, current working practice, and is applicable to a range of single and multi-objective real-world scenarios. We discuss the potential for metaheuristics (such as GAs) to efficiently find sufficiently good allocations which can provide recommendations for financial service managers in-the-loop.
  Originality: A key gap in existing allocation and scheduling models, is fully considering worker well-being. This paper presents an allocation model which explicitly optimises for well-being while still improving on current working practice for efficiency.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Explaining Customer Data Sharing in the Open Banking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors, providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models in Financial Investments and Market Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in financial decision making, enhancing analytical capabilities for investment strategies. Traditional investment strategies often utilize quantitative models, fundamental analysis, and technical indicators. However, LLMs have introduced new capabilities to process and analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured data, extract meaningful insights, and enhance decision-making in real-time. This survey provides a structured overview of recent research on LLMs within the financial domain, categorizing research contributions into four main frameworks: LLM-based Frameworks and Pipelines, Hybrid Integration Methods, Fine-Tuning and Adaptation Approaches, and Agent-Based Architectures. This study provides a structured review of recent LLMs research on applications in stock selection, risk assessment, sentiment analysis, trading, and financial forecasting. By reviewing the existing literature, this study highlights the capabilities, challenges, and potential directions of LLMs in financial markets.</description>

      <title>A unified model of horizontal differentiation with general spaces and irrational consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new microeconomic model of horizontal differentiation that unifies and extends previous developments inspired by the seminal work of Hotelling (1929). Our framework incorporates boundedly rational consumers, an unlimited number of firms, and arbitrary differentiation spaces with Riemannian manifolds. We argue that Riemannian geometry provides a natural and powerful tool for analyzing such models, offering fresh insights into firm behavior and market structure with complex products.</description>

      <title>FinAI-BERT: A Transformer-Based Model for Sentence-Level Detection of AI Disclosures in Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity, interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669 annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993), outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures. Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts, regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI across financial institutions.</description>

      <title>Fair sharing ratios of Profit and Loss sharing contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider islamic Profit and Loss (PL) sharing contract, possibly combined with an agency contract, and introduce the notion of {\em $c$-fair} profit sharing ratios ($c = (c_1, \ldots,c_d) \in (\mathbb R^{\star})^d$, where $d$ is the number of partners) which aims to determining both the profit sharing ratios and the induced expected maturity payoffs of each partner $\ell$ according to its contribution, determined by the rate component $c_{\ell}$ of the vector $c$, to the global success of the project. We show several new results that elucidate the relation between these profit sharing ratios and various important economic factors as the investment risk, the labor and the capital, giving accordingly a way of choosing them in connection with the real economy. The design of our approach allows the use of all the range of econometrics models or more general stochastic diffusion models to compute or approximate the quantities of interest.</description>
