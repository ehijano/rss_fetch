      <title>Improved Total Domination and Total Roman Domination in Unit Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph with no isolated vertex. A set $D_t\subseteq V$ is a total dominating set of $G$ if $(i)$ $D_t$ is a dominating set, and $(ii)$ the set $D_t$ induces a subgraph with no isolated vertex. The total dominating set of minimum cardinality is called the minimum total dominating set, and the size of the minimum total dominating set is called the total domination number ($\gamma_t(G)$). Given a graph $G$, the total dominating set (TDS) problem is to find a total dominating set of minimum cardinality. A Roman dominating function (RDF) on a graph $G$ is a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that each vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $u\in V$ with $f(u)=2$. A RDF $f$ of a graph $G$ is said to be a total Roman dominating function (TRDF) if the induced subgraph of $V_1\cup V_2$ does not contain any isolated vertex, where $V_i=\{u\in V|f(u)=i\}$. Given a graph $G$, the total Roman dominating set (TRDS) problem is to minimize the weight, $W(f)=\sum_{u\in V} f(u)$, called the total Roman domination number ($\gamma_{tR}(G)$). In this paper, we are the first to show that the TRDS problem is NP-complete in unit disk graphs (UDGs). Furthermore, we propose a $7.17\operatorname{-}$ factor approximation algorithm for the TDS problem and a $6.03\operatorname{-}$ factor approximation algorithm for the TRDS problem in geometric unit disk graphs. The running time for both algorithms is notably bounded by $O(n\log{k})$, where $n$ represents the number of vertices in the given UDG and $k$ represents the size of the independent set in (i.e., $D$ and $V_2$ in TDS and TRDS problems, respectively) the given UDG.</description>

      <title>On the Theoretical Expressive Power and the Design Space of Higher-Order Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph transformers have recently received significant attention in graph learning, partly due to their ability to capture more global interaction via self-attention. Nevertheless, while higher-order graph neural networks have been reasonably well studied, the exploration of extending graph transformers to higher-order variants is just starting. Both theoretical understanding and empirical results are limited. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of the theoretical expressive power of order-$k$ graph transformers and sparse variants. We first show that, an order-$k$ graph transformer without additional structural information is less expressive than the $k$-Weisfeiler Lehman ($k$-WL) test despite its high computational cost. We then explore strategies to both sparsify and enhance the higher-order graph transformers, aiming to improve both their efficiency and expressiveness. Indeed, sparsification based on neighborhood information can enhance the expressive power, as it provides additional information about input graph structures. In particular, we show that a natural neighborhood-based sparse order-$k$ transformer model is not only computationally efficient, but also expressive -- as expressive as $k$-WL test. We further study several other sparse graph attention models that are computationally efficient and provide their expressiveness analysis. Finally, we provide experimental results to show the effectiveness of the different sparsification strategies.</description>

      <title>Terrain Point Cloud Inpainting via Signal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of 3D acquisition technology has made it possible to obtain point clouds of real-world terrains. However, due to limitations in sensor acquisition technology or specific requirements, point clouds often contain defects such as holes with missing data. Inpainting algorithms are widely used to patch these holes. However, existing traditional inpainting algorithms rely on precise hole boundaries, which limits their ability to handle cases where the boundaries are not well-defined. On the other hand, learning-based completion methods often prioritize reconstructing the entire point cloud instead of solely focusing on hole filling. Based on the fact that real-world terrain exhibits both global smoothness and rich local detail, we propose a novel representation for terrain point clouds. This representation can help to repair the holes without clear boundaries. Specifically, it decomposes terrains into low-frequency and high-frequency components, which are represented by B-spline surfaces and relative height maps respectively. In this way, the terrain point cloud inpainting problem is transformed into a B-spline surface fitting and 2D image inpainting problem. By solving the two problems, the highly complex and irregular holes on the terrain point clouds can be well-filled, which not only satisfies the global terrain undulation but also exhibits rich geometric details. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Minimal Arrangements of Spherical Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03255v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study arrangements of geodesic arcs on a sphere, where all arcs are internally disjoint and each arc has its endpoints located within the interior of other arcs. We establish fundamental results concerning the minimum number of arcs in such arrangements, depending on local geometric constraints such as "one-sidedness" and "k-orientation".
  En route to these results, we generalize and settle an open problem from CCCG 2022, proving that any such arrangement has at least two "clockwise swirls" and at least two "counterclockwise swirls".</description>

      <title>On the $\ell_0$ Isoperimetric Coefficient of Measurable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the $\ell_0$ isoperimetric coefficient for any axis-aligned cubes, $\psi_{\mathcal{C}}$, is $\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ and that the isoperimetric coefficient for any measurable body $K$, $\psi_K$, is of order $O(n^{-1/2})$. As a corollary we deduce that axis-aligned cubes essentially "maximize" the $\ell_0$ isoperimetric coefficient: There exists a positive constant $q &gt; 0$ such that $\psi_K \leq q \cdot \psi_{\mathcal{C}}$, whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is an axis-aligned cube and $K$ is any measurable set. Lastly, we give immediate applications of our results to the mixing time of Coordinate-Hit-and-Run for sampling points uniformly from convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Computing Generalized Ranks of Persistence Modules via Unfolding to Zigzag Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a $P$-indexed persistence module ${\sf M}$, the (generalized) rank of ${\sf M}$ is defined as the rank of the limit-to-colimit map for the diagram of vector spaces of ${\sf M}$ over the poset $P$. For $2$-parameter persistence modules, recently a zigzag persistence based algorithm has been proposed that takes advantage of the fact that generalized rank for $2$-parameter modules is equal to the number of full intervals in a zigzag module defined on the boundary of the poset. Analogous definition of boundary for $d$-parameter persistence modules or general $P$-indexed persistence modules does not seem plausible. To overcome this difficulty, we first unfold a given $P$-indexed module ${\sf M}$ into a zigzag module ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ and then check how many full interval modules in a decomposition of ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ can be folded back to remain full in a decomposition of ${\sf M}$. This number determines the generalized rank of ${\sf M}$. For special cases of degree-$d$ homology for $d$-complexes, we obtain a more efficient algorithm including a linear time algorithm for degree-$1$ homology in graphs.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal Gr\"unbaum partition problem in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gr\"unbaum's equipartition problem asked if for any measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$ there are always $d$ hyperplanes which divide $\mathbb{R}^d$ into $2^d$ $\mu$-equal parts. This problem is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 3$ and a negative one for $d\ge 5$. A variant of this question is to require the hyperplanes to be mutually orthogonal. This variant is known to have a positive answer for $d\le 2$ and there is reason to expect it to have a negative answer for $d\ge 3$. In this note we exhibit measures that prove this. Additionally, we describe an algorithm that checks if a set of $8n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be split evenly by $3$ mutually orthogonal planes. To our surprise, it seems the probability that a random set of $8$ points chosen uniformly and independently in the unit cube does not admit such a partition is less than $0.001$.</description>
