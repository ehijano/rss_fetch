      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection using Maximum Entropy Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a default distribution $P$ and a set of test data $x^M=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_M\}$ this paper seeks to answer the question if it was likely that $x^M$ was generated by $P$. For discrete distributions, the definitive answer is in principle given by Kolmogorov-Martin-L\"{o}f randomness. In this paper we seek to generalize this to continuous distributions. We consider a set of statistics $T_1(x^M),T_2(x^M),\ldots$. To each statistic we associate its maximum entropy distribution and with this a universal source coder. The maximum entropy distributions are subsequently combined to give a total codelength, which is compared with $-\log P(x^M)$. We show that this approach satisfied a number of theoretical properties.
  For real world data $P$ usually is unknown. We transform data into a standard distribution in the latent space using a bidirectional generate network and use maximum entropy coding there. We compare the resulting method to other methods that also used generative neural networks to detect anomalies. In most cases, our results show better performance.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling for FR3 Upper Mid-band via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper mid-band (FR3) has been recently attracting interest for new generation of mobile networks, as it provides a promising balance between spectrum availability and coverage, which are inherent limitations of the sub 6GHz and millimeter wave bands, respectively. In order to efficiently design and optimize the network, channel modeling plays a key role since FR3 systems are expected to operate at multiple frequency bands. Data-driven methods, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), can capture the intricate relationships among data samples, and provide an appropriate tool for FR3 channel modeling. In this work, we present the architecture, link state model, and path generative network of GAN-based FR3 channel modeling. The comparison of our model greatly matches the ray-tracing simulated data.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Modulation for RIS-assisted Symbiotic Radios: Design, Analysis, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR), an RIS is exploited to assist the primary system and to simultaneously operate as a secondary transmitter by modulating its own information over the incident primary signal from the air. Such an operation is called over-the-air modulation. The existing modulation schemes such as on-off keying and binary phase-shift keying suffer from two problems for joint detection of the primary and secondary signals in RIS-assisted SR, i.e., one is the detection ambiguity problem when the direct link is blocked, and the other is the bit error rate (BER) error-floor problem when the direct link is weak. To address the two problems, we propose a novel modulation scheme by dividing the phase-shift matrix into two parts: one is the assistance beamforming matrix for assisting the primary system and the other is the transmission beamforming matrix for delivering the secondary signal. To optimize the assistance and transmission beamforming matrices, we first introduce an assistance factor that describes the performance requirement of the primary system and then formulate a problem to minimize the BER of the secondary system, while guaranteeing the BER requirement of the primary system controlled by the assistance factor. To solve this non-convex problem, we resort to the successive convex approximation technique to obtain a suboptimal solution. Furthermore, to draw more insights, we propose a low-complexity assistance-transmission beamforming structure by borrowing the idea from the classical maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing techniques. Finally, simulation results reveal an interesting tradeoff between the BER performance of the primary and secondary systems by adjusting the assistance factor.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</description>

      <title>Empirical Studies of Propagation Characteristics and Modeling Based on XL-MIMO Channel Measurement: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the sixth-generation (6G), the extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is considered a promising enabling technology. With the further expansion of array element number and frequency bands, near-field effects will be more likely to occur in 6G communication systems. The near-field radio communications (NFRC) will become crucial in 6G communication systems. It is known that the channel research is very important for the development and performance evaluation of the communication systems. In this paper, we will systematically investigate the channel measurements and modeling for the emerging NFRC. First, the principle design of massive MIMO channel measurement platform are solved. Second, an indoor XL-MIMO channel measurement campaign with 1600 array elements is conducted, and the channel characteristics are extracted and validated in the near-field region. Then, the outdoor XL-MIMO channel measurement campaign with 320 array elements is conducted, and the channel characteristics are extracted and modeled from near-field to far-field (NF-FF) region. The spatial non-stationary characteristics of angular spread at the transmitting end are more important in modeling. We hope that this work will give some reference to the near-field and far-field research for 6G.</description>

      <title>Performance Bounds of Near-Field Sensing with Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance bounds of near-field sensing are studied for circular arrays, focusing on the impact of bandwidth and array size. The closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRBs) for angle and distance estimation are derived, revealing the scaling laws of the CRBs with bandwidth and array size. Contrary to expectations, enlarging array size does not always enhance sensing performance. Furthermore, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed under different conditions, unveiling that the derived expressions include the existing results as special cases. Finally, the derived expressions are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Deepcode, a learned feedback code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have recently been used to construct non-linear codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. However, there is limited understanding of how these black-box-like codes with many learned parameters use feedback. This study aims to uncover the fundamental principles underlying the first deep-learned feedback code, known as Deepcode, which is based on an RNN architecture. Our interpretable model based on Deepcode is built by analyzing the influence length of inputs and approximating the non-linear dynamics of the original black-box RNN encoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our interpretable model -- which includes both an encoder and a decoder -- achieves comparable performance to Deepcode while offering an interpretation of how it employs feedback for error correction.</description>

      <title>Immersed in Reality Secured by Design -- A Comprehensive Analysis of Security Measures in AR/VR Environments</title>

Abstract: Virtual reality and related technologies such as mixed and augmented reality have received extensive coverage in both mainstream and fringe media outlets. When the subject goes to a new AR headset, another AR device, or AR glasses, the talk swiftly shifts to the technical and design details. Unfortunately, no one seemed to care about security. Data theft and other forms of cyberattack pose serious threats to virtual reality systems. Virtual reality goggles are just specialist versions of computers or Internet of Things devices, whereas virtual reality experiences are software packages. As a result, AR systems are just as vulnerable as any other Internet of Things (IoT) device we use on a daily basis, such as computers, tablets, and phones. Preventing and responding to common cybersecurity threats and assaults is crucial. Cybercriminals can exploit virtual reality headsets just like any other computer system. This paper analysis the data breach induced by these assaults could result in a variety of concerns, including but not limited to identity theft, the unauthorized acquisition of personal information or network credentials, damage to hardware and software, and so on. Augmented reality (AR) allows for real-time monitoring and visualization of network activity, system logs, and security alerts. This allows security professionals to immediately identify threats, monitor suspicious activities, and fix any issues that develop. This data can be displayed in an aesthetically pleasing and intuitively structured format using augmented reality interfaces, enabling for faster analysis and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Structured Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Optimal Data Transmission in Dense mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the data packet transmission problem (mmDPT) in dense cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, i.e., users sending data packet requests to access points (APs) via uplinks and APs transmitting requested data packets to users via downlinks. Our objective is to minimize the average delay in the system due to APs' limited service capacity and unreliable wireless channels between APs and users. This problem can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandits problem with fairness constraint (RMAB-F). Since finding the optimal policy for RMAB-F is intractable, existing learning algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for practical dynamic dense mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a structured reinforcement learning (RL) solution for mmDPT by exploiting the inherent structure encoded in RMAB-F. To achieve this, we first design a low-complexity and provably asymptotically optimal index policy for RMAB-F. Then, we leverage this structure information to develop a structured RL algorithm called mmDPT-TS, which provably achieves an \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) Bayesian regret. More importantly, mmDPT-TS is computation-efficient and thus amenable to practical implementation, as it fully exploits the structure of index policy for making decisions. Extensive emulation based on data collected in realistic mmWave networks demonstrate significant gains of mmDPT-TS over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>The distance function on Coxeter-like graphs and self-dual codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ be the set of all invertible $n\times n$ symmetric matrices over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Let $\Gamma_n$ be the graph with the vertex set $SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ where a pair of matrices $\{A,B\}$ form an edge if and only if $\textrm{rank}(A-B)=1$. In particular, $\Gamma_3$ is the well-known Coxeter graph. The distance function $d(A,B)$ in $\Gamma_n$ is described for all matrices $A,B\in SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. The diameter of $\Gamma_n$ is computed. For odd $n\geq 3$, it is shown that each matrix $A\in SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ such that $d(A,I)=\frac{n+5}{2}$ and $\textrm{rank}(A-I)=\frac{n+1}{2}$ where $I$ is the identity matrix induces a self-dual code in $\mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}$. Conversely, each self-dual code $C$ induces a family ${\cal F}_C$ of such matrices $A$. The families given by distinct self-dual codes are disjoint. The identification $C\leftrightarrow {\cal F}_C$ provides a graph theoretical description of self-dual codes. A result of Janusz (2007) is reproved and strengthened by showing that the orthogonal group ${\cal O}_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ acts transitively on the set of all self-dual codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}$.</description>

Abstract: The Additive-Multiplicative Matrix Channel (AMMC) was introduced by Silva, Kschischang and K\"otter in 2010 to model data transmission using random linear network coding. The input and output of the channel are $n\times m$ matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On input the matrix $X$, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where $A$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and where $W$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $t$.
  Silva \emph{et al} considered the case when $2n\leq m$. They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when $t$, $n$ and $m$ are fixed and $q\rightarrow\infty$. They also determined the leading term of the capacity when $q$ is fixed, and $t$, $n$ and $m$ grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when $q$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging research area that has gained a wide range of attention recently. Despite this growing interest, there remains a notable absence of a comprehensive and widely-accepted framework for characterizing semantic communication. This paper introduces a new conceptualization of semantic communication and formulates two fundamental problems, which we term language exploitation and language design. Our contention is that the challenge of language design can be effectively situated within the broader framework of joint source-channel coding theory, underpinned by a comprehensive end-to-end distortion metric. To tackle the language exploitation problem, we put forth three approaches: semantic encoding, semantic decoding, and a synergistic combination of both in the form of combined semantic encoding and decoding. Furthermore, we establish the semantic distortion-cost region as a critical framework for assessing the language exploitation problem. For each of the three proposed approaches, the achievable distortion-cost region is characterized. Overall, this paper aims to shed light on the intricate dynamics of semantic communication, paving the way for a deeper understanding of this evolving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new finite form of de Finetti's representation theorem is established using elementary information-theoretic tools. The distribution of the first $k$ random variables in an exchangeable vector of $n\geq k$ random variables is close to a mixture of product distributions. Closeness is measured in terms of the relative entropy and an explicit bound is provided. This bound is tighter than those obtained via earlier information-theoretic proofs, and its utility extends to random variables taking values in general spaces. The core argument employed has its origins in the quantum information-theoretic literature.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity Region of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Symbiotic Radios</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR) system, where an RIS assists a primary transmission by passive beamforming and simultaneously acts as an information transmitter by periodically adjusting its reflection coefficients. The above RIS functions innately enable a new multiplicative multiple access channel (M-MAC), where the primary and secondary signals are superposed in a multiplicative manner. To pursue the fundamental performance limits of M-MAC, we focus on the characterization of the capacity region for such a system when the direct link is blocked. Due to the reflection nature of RIS, the signal transmitted from the RIS should satisfy a passive reflection constraint. We consider two types of passive reflection constraints, one for the case that only the phases of the RIS can be adjusted, while the other for the case that both the amplitude and the phase can be adjusted. Under the passive reflection constraints at the RIS as well as the average power constraint at the primary transmitter (PTx), we characterize the capacity region of RIS-assisted SR. It is observed that: 1) the number of sum-rate-optimal points on the boundary of the capacity region is infinite; 2) for the rate pairs with the maximum sum rate, the optimal distribution of the amplitude of the primary signal is a continuous Rayleigh distribution, while for the remaining rate pairs on the capacity region boundary, the optimal amplitude of the primary signal is discrete; 3) the adjustment of the amplitude for the RIS can enlarge the capacity region as compared to the phase-adjusted-only case.</description>

Abstract: Constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences have modulus one and ideal periodic autocorrelation function. Such sequences are used in cellular radio communications systems, e.g., for reference signals, synchronization signals and random access preambles. We propose a new family CAZAC sequences, which is constructed by interleaving a Zadoff-Chu sequence by a quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP), or by a permutation polynomial whose inverse is a QPP. It is demonstrated that a set of orthogonal interleaved Zadoff-Chu sequences can be constructed by proper choice of QPPs.</description>

      <title>Modulation Design and Optimization for RIS-Assisted Symbiotic Radios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR), the RIS acts as a secondary transmitter by modulating its information bits over the incident primary signal and simultaneously assists the primary transmission, then a cooperative receiver is used to jointly decode the primary and secondary signals. Most existing works of SR focus on using RIS to enhance the reflecting link while ignoring the ambiguity problem for the joint detection caused by the multiplication relationship of the primary and secondary signals. Particularly, in case of a blocked direct link, joint detection will suffer from severe performance loss due to the ambiguity, when using the conventional on-off keying and binary phase shift keying modulation schemes for RIS. To address this issue, we propose a novel modulation scheme for RIS-assisted SR that divides the phase-shift matrix into two components: the symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which are used to assist the primary transmission and carry the secondary signal, respectively. To design these two components, we focus on the detection of the composite signal formed by the primary and secondary signals, through which a problem of minimizing the bit error rate (BER) of the composite signal is formulated to improve both the BER performance of the primary and secondary ones. By solving the problem, we derive the closed-form solution of the optimal symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which is related to the channel strength ratio of the direct link to the reflecting link. Moreover, theoretical BER performance is analyzed. Finally, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed modulation scheme over its conventional counterpart.</description>

      <title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enhanced Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In opportunistic cognitive radio networks, when the primary signal is very weak compared to the background noise, the secondary user requires long sensing time to achieve a reliable spectrum sensing performance, leading to little remaining time for the secondary transmission. To tackle this issue, we propose an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted spectrum sensing system, where the received signal strength from the interested primary user can be enhanced and underlying interference within the background noise can be mitigated as well. In comparison with the passive RIS, the active RIS can not only adapt the phase shift of each reflecting element but also amplify the incident signals. Notably, we study the reflecting coefficient matrix (RCM) optimization problem to improve the detection probability given a maximum tolerable false alarm probability and limited sensing time. Then, we show that the formulated problem can be equivalently transformed to a weighted mean square error minimization problem using the principle of the well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, and an iterative optimization approach is proposed to obtain the optimal RCM. In addition, to fairly compare passive RIS and active RIS, we study the required power budget of the RIS to achieve a target detection probability under a special case where the direct links are neglected and the RIS-related channels are line-of-sight. Via extensive simulations, the effectiveness of the WMMSE-based RCM optimization approach is demonstrated. Furthermore, the results reveal that the active RIS can outperform the passive RIS when the underlying interference within the background noise is relatively weak, whereas the passive RIS performs better in strong interference scenarios because the same power budget can support a vast number of passive reflecting elements for interference mitigation.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Minimum Weight Codewords of Pre-Transformed Polar Codes by Tree Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-transformed polar codes (PTPCs) form a class of codes that perform close to the finite-length capacity bounds. The minimum distance and the number of minimum weight codewords are two decisive properties for their performance. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for determining the number of minimum weight codewords of general PTPCs that eliminates all redundant visits to nodes of the search tree, thus reducing the computational complexity typically by several orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. This reduction in complexity allows, for the first time, the minimum distance properties to be directly considered in the code design of PTPCs. The algorithm is demonstrated for randomly pre-transformed Reed-Muller (RM) codes and polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes. Furthermore, we design optimal polynomials for PAC codes with this algorithm, minimizing the number of minimum weight codewords.</description>

      <title>On Merits of Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling in the Finite Blocklength Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify potential merits of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. A unique aspect of FTN signaling is that it can increase the blocklength by packing more data symbols within the same time and frequency to yield strictly higher number of independent signaling dimensions than that of Nyquist rate signaling. Using the finite-blocklength information theory, we provide tight bounds on the maximum channel coding rate (MCCR) of FTN signaling for any finite time-bandwidth product. The merits are categorized into two operating regions of FTN, i.e., when the time-acceleration factor of FTN, $\tau$, is above or below a certain threshold $\tau_{0}$. When $\tau &gt; \tau_{0}$, FTN has both higher channel capacity and MCCR than that of Nyquist rate signaling, when the utilized pulse shape is non-sinc. Since the issues associated with the ideal sinc pulse only get exacerbated when packets are short, the benefit of FTN becomes more significant in the FBL regime. On the other hand, when $\tau &lt; \tau_{0}$, the channel capacity is fixed but MCCR of FTN can continue to increase to a certain degree, thereby reducing the gap between the capacity and MCCR. This benefit is present regardless of the utilized pulse shape, including the ideal sinc-pulse, and is unique to the FBL regime. Instead of increasing MCCR for fixed block error rates, FTN can alternatively lower the block error rates for fixed channel coding rates. These results imply that FTN can lower the penalty from limited channel coding over short blocklength and can improve the performance and reliability of short packet communications.</description>

      <title>Half-Space Modeling with Reflecting Surface in Molecular Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Molecular Communications via Diffusion (MCvD), messenger molecules are emitted by a transmitter and propagate randomly through the fluidic environment. In biological systems, the environment can be considered a bounded space, surrounded by various structures such as tissues and organs. The propagation of molecules is affected by these structures, which reflect the molecules upon collision. Deriving the channel response of MCvD systems with an absorbing spherical receiver requires solving the 3-D diffusion equation in the presence of reflecting and absorbing boundary conditions, which is extremely challenging. In this paper, the method of images is brought to molecular communication (MC) realm to find a closed-form solution to the channel response of a single-input single-output (SISO) system near an infinite reflecting surface. We showed that a molecular SISO system in a 3-D half-space with an infinite reflecting surface could be approximated as a molecular single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system in a 3-D space, which consists of two symmetrically located, with respect to the reflecting surface, identical absorbing spherical receivers.</description>

      <title>Transmitter Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS for mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work initiates the study of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided transmitter architecture for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. Deploying BD-RIS at the transmitter side not only alleviates the need for extensive fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains but also enhances both communication and sensing performance. These benefits are facilitated by the additional design flexibility introduced by the fully-connected scattering matrix of BD-RIS. To achieve the aforementioned benefits, in this work, we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to design the digital beamforming of the transmitter and the scattering matrix of the BD-RIS with the aim of jointly maximizing the sum rate for multiple communication users and minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multiple sensing targets. Numerical results show that the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided mmWave ISAC outperforms the conventional diagonal-RIS-aided ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Additive Complementary Pairs of Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An additive code is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, which is not a linear subspace over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Linear complementary pairs(LCP) of codes have important roles in cryptography, such as increasing the speed and capacity of digital communication and strengthening security by improving the encryption necessities to resist cryptanalytic attacks. This paper studies an algebraic structure of additive complementary pairs (ACP) of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. Further, we characterize an ACP of codes in analogous generator matrices and parity check matrices. Additionally, we identify a necessary condition for an ACP of codes. Besides, we present some constructions of an ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ from LCP codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and also from an LCP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Finally, we study the constacyclic ACP of codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ and the counting of the constacyclic ACP of codes. As an application of our study, we consider a class of quantum codes called Entanglement Assisted Quantum Error Correcting Code (EAQEC codes). As a consequence, we derive some EAQEC codes.</description>

      <title>Flexible Field Sizes in Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication via Efficient Interference Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) scheme using the inner product partitioning. We construct a scheme with a minimal number of workers and no redundancy, and another scheme with redundancy against stragglers. Unlike previous constructions in the literature, we do not utilize algebraic methods such as locally repairable codes or algebraic geometry codes. Our construction, which is based on generalized Reed-Solomon codes, improves the flexibility of the field size as it does not assume any divisibility constraints among the different parameters. We achieve a minimal number of workers by efficiently canceling all interference terms with a suitable orthogonal decoding vector. Finally, we discuss how the MDS conjecture impacts the smallest achievable field size for SDMM schemes and show that our construction almost achieves the bound given by the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two critical aspects of security in the distributed computing (DC) model: secure data shuffling and secure coded computing. It is imperative that any external entity overhearing the transmissions does not gain any information about the intermediate values (IVs) exchanged during the shuffling phase of the DC model. Our approach ensures IV confidentiality during data shuffling. Moreover, each node in the system must be able to recover the IVs necessary for computing its output functions but must also remain oblivious to the IVs associated with output functions not assigned to it. We design secure DC methods and establish achievable limits on the tradeoffs between the communication and computation loads to contribute to the advancement of secure data processing in distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Good Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes from the NTRU cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of random Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes derived from the cryptanalysis of the so-called NTRU cryptosystem. The derived codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling $\Delta \propto \sqrt{n}$ with high probability, where $n$ is the number of bosonic modes, which is a distance scaling equivalent to that of a GKP code obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.</description>

      <title>Quantum soft-covering lemma with applications to rate-distortion coding, resolvability and identification via quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum soft-covering problem for a given general quantum channel and one of its output states, which consists in finding the minimum rank of an input state needed to approximate the given channel output. We then prove a one-shot quantum covering lemma in terms of smooth min-entropies by leveraging decoupling techniques from quantum Shannon theory. This covering result is shown to be equivalent to a coding theorem for rate distortion under a posterior (reverse) channel distortion criterion by two of the present authors. Both one-shot results directly yield corollaries about the i.i.d. asymptotics, in terms of the coherent information of the channel.
  The power of our quantum covering lemma is demonstrated by two additional applications: first, we formulate a quantum channel resolvability problem, and provide one-shot as well as asymptotic upper and lower bounds. Secondly, we provide new upper bounds on the unrestricted and simultaneous identification capacities of quantum channels, in particular separating for the first time the simultaneous identification capacity from the unrestricted one, proving a long-standing conjecture of the last author.</description>
