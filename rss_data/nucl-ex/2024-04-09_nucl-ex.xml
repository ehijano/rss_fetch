      <title>Nuclear charge radii of germanium isotopes around $N$ = 40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy measurements were performed on $^{68-74}$Ge isotopes ($Z = 32$) at ISOLDE-CERN, by probing the $4s^2 4p^2 \, ^3\!P_1 \rightarrow 4s^2 4p 5s \, ^3\!P_1^o$ atomic transition (269~nm) of germanium. Nuclear charge radii are determined via the measured isotope shifts, revealing a larger local variation than the neighboring isotopic chains. Nuclear density functional theory with the Fayans functionals Fy($\Delta r$,HFB) and Fy(IVP), and the SV-min Skyrme describes the experimental data for the differential charge radii $\delta\langle r^{2} \rangle$ and charge radii $R_{\rm c}$ within the theoretical uncertainties. The observed large variation in the charge radii of germanium isotopes is better accounted for by theoretical models incorporating ground state quadrupole correlations. This suggests that the polarization effects due to pairing and deformation contribute to the observed large odd-even staggering in the charge radii of the Ge isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>Shape transition and coexistence in Te isotopes studied with the quadrupole collective Hamiltonian based on a relativistic energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution and coexistence of shape and the related collective states of even-even Te isotopes are investigated within the quadrupole collective model that is based on the nuclear density functional theory. By means of the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations performed within the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov method with a choice of an energy density functional and a pairing force, parameters of the triaxial quadrupole collective Hamiltonian are completely determines. The collective model produces for the near mid-shell nuclei, e.g., $^{116}$Te and $^{118}$Te, low-energy and low-spin excited states, including the $0^+_2$ state, that can be interpreted as the intruder states associated with the strongly deformed prolate minimum in the potential energy surface, along with the $0^+_1$ ground state that is attributed to the normal state based on a weakly oblate deformed global minimum. The collective model calculation suggests the lowering of the $0^+_2$ energy level toward neutron mid-shell, as observed experimentally. The sensitivity of the mean-field and spectroscopic results to the choice of the pairing strength is also analyzed, and it is shown that by increasing the pairing strength description of the low-lying states of the near mid-shell nuclei is improved.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>On the multipole mixing ratio of the 365 keV $\gamma$-transition in $^{129}$Ba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $E2/M1$ multipole mixing ratio ($\delta$), reported by J. Gizon et al. Phys. Rev. C 17, 596 (1978), for 365 keV $\gamma$-transition in $^{129}$Ba is reevaluated and found altered. Experimentally determined angular distribution coefficients indicate a large E2 admixture in the 365 keV $\gamma$-ray. Indeed, it is found in better agreement with the reported linear polarization value for this $\gamma$-ray.</description>

      <title>Superallowed nuclear beta decays and precision tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many decades, the main source of information on the top-left corner element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix $V_{ud}$ were superallowed nuclear beta decays with an impressive 0.01\% precision. This precision, apart from experimental data, relies on theoretical calculations in which nuclear structure-dependent effects and uncertainties play a prime role. This review is dedicated to a thorough reassessment of all ingredients that enter the extraction of the value of $V_{ud}$ from experimental data. We tried to keep balance between historical retrospect and new developments, many of which occurred in just five past years. They have not yet been reviewed in a complete manner, not least because new results are a-coming. This review aims at filling this gap and offers an in-depth yet accessible summary of all recent developments.</description>

      <title>Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>
