      <title>A new method of petroleum well logging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new petroleum well logging method - electrical impedance logging for shaly sand reservoirs - through theoretical and petrophysical experimental research. Electrical impedance logging measures the electrical impedance of shaly sand reservoirs, extracts resistivity information from the real part, and uses it to determine the oil saturation of the reservoir quantitatively. The study shows that the resistivity, extracted from the real part of the electrical impedance in shaly sands, has characteristics similar to those of the pure sandstone formation resistivity and can be directly used in Archie's law for oil-bearing interpretation of reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Exploring constraints on the core radius and density jumps inside Earth using atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos, through their weak interactions, can serve as an independent tool for exploring the internal structure of Earth. The information obtained would be complementary to that provided by seismic and gravitational measurements. The Earth matter effects in neutrino oscillations depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the electron density distribution that they encounter during their journey through Earth, and hence, can be used to probe the inner structure of Earth. In this contribution, we demonstrate how well an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as an iron calorimeter detector (ICAL), would simultaneously constrain the density jumps inside Earth and determine the location of the core-mantle boundary. In this work, we employ a five-layered density model of Earth, where the layer densities and core radius are modified to explore the parameter space, ensuring that the mass and moment of inertia of Earth remain constant while satisfying the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We further demonstrate that the charge identification capability of an ICAL-like detector would play a crucial role in obtaining these correlated constraints.</description>

      <title>Sub-critical athermal flow in disordered materials caused by periodic variations of environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yield stress materials deform irreversibly at a finite strain-rate if loaded with a fixed stress $\sigma$ larger than some critical yield stress $\sigma_c$. When $\sigma&lt;\sigma_c$ deformation is only transient, unless thermal activation plays a role, in which case persistent deformation occurs as a creep activated process. Yet in subcritical athermal conditions we observe that cyclic time variation of system parameters can induce a steady-state flow, with a total deformation that scales linearly with the number of cycles applied. We characterize this phenomenon using well established models in the fields of depinning and yielding transitions. Interestingly, there is an endurance limit $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ for this process to occur, below which the advance is totally suppressed. We discuss implications of our findings to the study of sub-critical evolution of landforms in which periodic variations of external conditions (as for instance daily/seasonal cycles of temperature, humidity, etc.) are expected.</description>

      <title>On the features of great Forbush effect during May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed pulse shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component -type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a singular mode of charge transfer with a range of junction-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning, and large labeled datasets are needed for training. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization algorithm updates the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models obtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Geodynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many super-Earths are on very short orbits around their host star and, therefore, more likely to be tidally locked. Because this locking can lead to a strong contrast between the dayside and nightside surface temperatures, these super-Earths could exhibit mantle convection patterns and tectonics that could differ significantly from those observed in the present-day solar system. The presence of an atmosphere, however, would allow transport of heat from the dayside towards the nightside and thereby reduce the surface temperature contrast between the two hemispheres. On rocky planets, atmospheric and geodynamic regimes are closely linked, which directly connects the question of atmospheric thickness to the potential interior dynamics of the planet. Here, we study the interior dynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b ($R=1.34$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M=3.0$ $M_{\oplus}$, T$_\mathrm{eq}\approx700$ K), which is one of the most suitable M-dwarf super-Earth candidates for retaining an atmosphere produced by degassing from the mantle and magma ocean. We investigate how the geodynamic regime of GJ 486b is influenced by different surface temperature contrasts by varying possible atmospheric circulation regimes. We also investigate how the strength of the lithosphere affects the convection pattern. We find that hemispheric tectonics, the surface expression of degree-1 convection with downwellings forming on one hemisphere and upwelling material rising on the opposite hemisphere, is a consequence of the strong lithosphere rather than surface temperature contrast. Anchored hemispheric tectonics, where downwellings und upwellings have a preferred (day/night) hemisphere, is favoured for strong temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside and higher surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.</description>
