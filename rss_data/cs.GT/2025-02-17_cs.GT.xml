      <title>On the existence of EFX allocations in multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of "fairly" dividing indivisible goods to several agents that have valuation set functions over the sets of goods. As fair we consider the allocations that are envy-free up to any good (EFX), i.e., no agent envies any proper subset of the goods given to any other agent. The existence or not of EFX allocations is a major open problem in Fair Division, and there are only positive results for special cases.
  [George Christodoulou, Amos Fiat, Elias Koutsoupias, Alkmini Sgouritsa 2023] introduced a restriction on the agents' valuations according to a graph structure: the vertices correspond to agents and the edges to goods, and each vertex/agent has zero marginal value (or in other words, they are indifferent) for the edges/goods that are not adjacent to them. The existence of EFX allocations has been shown for simple graphs with general monotone valuations [George Christodoulou, Amos Fiat, Elias Koutsoupias, Alkmini Sgouritsa 2023], and for multigraphs for restricted additive valuations [Alireza Kaviani, Masoud Seddighin, Amir Mohammad Shahrezaei 2024].
  In this work, we push the state-of-the-art further, and show that the EFX allocations always exists in multigraphs and general monotone valuations if any of the following three conditions hold: either (a) the multigraph is bipartite, or (b) each agent has at most $\lceil \frac{n}{4} \rceil -1$ neighbors, where $n$ is the total number of agents, or (c) the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least 6.</description>

      <title>Prior-Independent Bidding Strategies for First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-price auctions are one of the most popular mechanisms for selling goods and services, with applications ranging from display advertising to timber sales. Unlike their close cousin, the second-price auction, first-price auctions do not admit a dominant strategy. Instead, each buyer must design a bidding strategy that maps values to bids -- a task that is often challenging due to the lack of prior knowledge about competing bids. To address this challenge, we conduct a principled analysis of prior-independent bidding strategies for first-price auctions using worst-case regret as the performance measure. First, we develop a technique to evaluate the worst-case regret for (almost) any given value distribution and bidding strategy, reducing the complex task of ascertaining the worst-case competing-bid distribution to a simple line search. Next, building on our evaluation technique, we minimize worst-case regret and characterize a minimax-optimal bidding strategy for every value distribution. We achieve it by explicitly constructing a bidding strategy as a solution to an ordinary differential equation, and by proving its optimality for the intricate infinite-dimensional minimax problem underlying worst-case regret minimization. Our construction provides a systematic and computationally-tractable procedure for deriving minimax-optimal bidding strategies. When the value distribution is continuous, it yields a deterministic strategy that maps each value to a single bid. We also show that our minimax strategy significantly outperforms the uniform-bid-shading strategies advanced by prior work. Our result allows us to precisely quantify, through minimax regret, the performance loss due to a lack of knowledge about competing bids. We leverage this to analyze the impact of the value distribution on the performance loss, and find that it decreases as the buyer's values become more dispersed.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Maximum Matching under Dichotomous Agent Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-sided matching problem in which the agents on one side have dichotomous preferences and the other side representing institutions has strict preferences (priorities). It captures several important applications in matching market design in which the agents are only interested in getting matched to an acceptable institution. These include centralized daycare assignment and healthcare rationing. We present a compelling new mechanism that satisfies many prominent and desirable properties including individual rationality, maximum size, fairness, Pareto-efficiency on both sides, strategyproofness on both sides, non-bossiness and having polynomial time running time. As a result, we answer an open problem whether there exists a mechanism that is agent-strategyproof, maximum, fair and non-bossy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the proportional clustering problem using the Droop quota for $k = 1$ is equivalent to the $\beta$-plurality problem. We also show that the Plurality Veto rule can be used to select ($\sqrt{5} - 2$)-plurality points using only ordinal information about the metric space and resolve an open question of Kalayci et al. (AAAI 2024) by proving that $(2+\sqrt{5})$-proportionally fair clusterings can be found using purely ordinal information.</description>

      <title>IRS-assisted Edge Computing for Vehicular Networks: A Generative Diffusion Model-based Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and mobile edge computing (MEC) offer new opportunities to enhance the performance of vehicular networks. However, meeting the computation-intensive and latency-sensitive demands of vehicles remains challenging due to the energy constraints and dynamic environments. To address this issue, we study an IRS-assisted MEC architecture for vehicular networks. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at minimizing the total task completion delay and total energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, IRS phase shift vector, and computation resource allocation. Given the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based Stackelberg game (GDMSG) approach. Specifically, the problem is reformulated within a Stackelberg game framework, where generative GDM is integrated to capture complex dynamics to efficiently derive optimal solutions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GDMSG achieves outstanding performance compared to the benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>When 1+1 does not equal 2: Synergy in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although synergy is an important concept that is strongly ingrained in games, it has not been widely discussed by the games community. This is due to the vagueness of the concept and the fact that there is no clear agreement on what it means. To solve this, we present a strict definition of what is synergy. Then we propose a methodology to use this definition to analyze synergy in games. Applying this definition to various games (Chess, League of Legends, and Magic: The Gathering), we illustrate how it can be used to solve many of the practical problems related to synergy.</description>

      <title>Incentivize without Bonus: Provably Efficient Model-based Online Multi-agent RL for Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) lies at the heart of a plethora of applications involving the interaction of a group of agents in a shared unknown environment. A prominent framework for studying MARL is Markov games, with the goal of finding various notions of equilibria in a sample-efficient manner, such as the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE). However, existing sample-efficient approaches either require tailored uncertainty estimation under function approximation, or careful coordination of the players. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based algorithm, called VMG, that incentivizes exploration via biasing the empirical estimate of the model parameters towards those with a higher collective best-response values of all the players when fixing the other players' policies, thus encouraging the policy to deviate from its current equilibrium for more exploration. VMG is oblivious to different forms of function approximation, and permits simultaneous and uncoupled policy updates of all players. Theoretically, we also establish that VMG achieves a near-optimal regret for finding both the NEs of two-player zero-sum Markov games and CCEs of multi-player general-sum Markov games under linear function approximation in an online environment, which nearly match their counterparts with sophisticated uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>A Multiagent Path Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Coalition Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coalition structure generation (CSG), i.e. the problem of optimally partitioning a set of agents into coalitions to maximize social welfare, is a fundamental computational problem in multiagent systems. This problem is important for many applications where small run times are necessary, including transportation and disaster response. In this paper, we develop SALDAE, a multiagent path finding algorithm for CSG that operates on a graph of coalition structures. Our algorithm utilizes a variety of heuristics and strategies to perform the search and guide it. It is an anytime algorithm that can handle large problems with hundreds and thousands of agents. We show empirically on nine standard value distributions, including disaster response and electric vehicle allocation benchmarks, that our algorithm enables a rapid finding of high-quality solutions and compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Strategy-Based and Atari Games: A Review of Google DeepMinds Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used in many applications, particularly in gaming, which serves as an excellent training ground for AI models. Google DeepMind has pioneered innovations in this field, employing reinforcement learning algorithms, including model-based, model-free, and deep Q-network approaches, to create advanced AI models such as AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and MuZero. AlphaGo, the initial model, integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, surpassing professional human players. AlphaGo Zero refines this approach by eliminating reliance on human gameplay data, instead utilizing self-play for enhanced learning efficiency. MuZero further extends these advancements by learning the underlying dynamics of game environments without explicit knowledge of the rules, achieving adaptability across various games, including complex Atari games. This paper reviews the significance of reinforcement learning applications in Atari and strategy-based games, analyzing these three models, their key innovations, training processes, challenges encountered, and improvements made. Additionally, we discuss advancements in the field of gaming, including MiniZero and multi-agent models, highlighting future directions and emerging AI models from Google DeepMind.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Preference Elicitation in Combinatorial Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans to simplify preference elicitation (PE) in combinatorial assignment. While traditional PE methods rely on iterative queries to capture preferences, LLMs offer a one-shot alternative with reduced human effort. We propose a framework for LLM proxies that can work in tandem with SOTA ML-powered preference elicitation schemes. Our framework handles the novel challenges introduced by LLMs, such as response variability and increased computational costs. We experimentally evaluate the efficiency of LLM proxies against human queries in the well-studied course allocation domain, and we investigate the model capabilities required for success. We find that our approach improves allocative efficiency by up to 20%, and these results are robust across different LLMs and to differences in quality and accuracy of reporting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incentivizing the existing participants to invite new participants to join an auction, matching or cooperative game have been extensively studied recently. One common challenge to design such incentive in these games is that the invitees and inviters are competitors. To have such an incentive, we normally have to sacrifice some of the traditional properties. Especially, in a housing market (one kind of one-sided matching), we cannot maintain the traditional stability and optimality. The previous studies proposed some new matching mechanisms to have the invitation incentive (part of the incentive compatibility), but did not have any guarantee on stability and optimality.
  In this paper, we propose new notions of stability and optimality which are achievable with incentive compatibility. We weaken stability and optimality on a special structure (complete components) on networks. We first prove that the weakened notions are the best we can achieve with incentive compatibility. Then, we propose three mechanisms (Swap With Neighbors, Leave and Share, and Connected Trading Cycles) to satisfy the desirable properties. Connected Trading Cycles is the first mechanism to satisfy the best stability and optimality compatible with incentive compatibility.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Cybersecurity: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the scale of consequences attributable to cyber attacks, the field of cybersecurity has long outgrown ad-hoc decision-making. A popular choice to provide disciplined decision-making in cybersecurity is Game Theory, which seeks to mathematically understand strategic interaction. In practice though, game-theoretic approaches are scarcely utilized (to our knowledge), highlighting the need to understand the deficit between the existing state-of-the-art and the needs of cybersecurity practitioners. Therefore, we develop a framework to characterize the function and assumptions of existing works as applied to cybersecurity and leverage it to characterize 80 unique technical papers. Then, we leverage this information to analyze the capabilities of the proposed models in comparison to the application-specific needs they are meant to serve, as well as the practicality of implementing the proposed solution. Our main finding is that Game Theory largely fails to incorporate notions of uncertainty critical to the application being considered. To remedy this, we provide guidance in terms of how to incorporate uncertainty in a model, what forms of uncertainty are critical to consider in each application area, and how to model the information that is available in each application area.</description>

      <title>Fair and Truthful Allocations Under Leveled Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods among agents which are equipped with {\em leveled} valuation functions. Such preferences, that have been studied before in economics and fair division literature, capture a simple and intuitive economic behavior; larger bundles are always preferred to smaller ones. We provide a fine-grained analysis for various subclasses of leveled valuations focusing on two extensively studied notions of fairness, (approximate) MMS and EFX. In particular, we present a general positive result, showing the existence of $2/3$-MMS allocations under valuations that are both leveled and submodular. We also show how some of our ideas can be used beyond the class of leveled valuations; for the case of two submodular (not necessarily leveled) agents we show that there always exists a $2/3$-MMS allocation, complementing a recent impossibility result. Then, we switch to the case of subadditive and fractionally subadditive leveled agents, where we are able to show tight (lower and upper) bounds of $1/2$ on the approximation factor of MMS. Moreover, we show the existence of exact EFX allocations under general leveled valuations via a simple protocol that in addition satisfies several natural economic properties. Finally, we take a mechanism design approach and we propose protocols that are both truthful and approximately fair under leveled valuations.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Solver for 2p0s Differential Games with One-Sided Payoff Information and Continuous Actions, States, and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing solvers for imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs) often struggle with scalability in terms of action and state space sizes and the number of time steps. However, many real-world games involve continuous action and state spaces and occur in continuous time, making them differential in nature. This paper addresses the scalability challenges for a representative class of two-player zero-sum (2p0s) differential games where the informed player knows the game type (payoff) while the uninformed one only has a prior belief over the set of possible types. Such games encompass a wide range of attack-defense scenarios, where the defender adapts based on their belief about the attacker's target. We make the following contributions: (1) We show that under the Isaacs' condition, the complexity of computing the Nash equilibrium for these games is not related to the action space size; and (2) we propose a multigrid approach to effectively reduce the cost of these games when many time steps are involved. Code for this work is available at https://github.com/ghimiremukesh/cams/tree/conf_sub.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike Poker where the action space $\mathcal{A}$ is discrete, differential games in the physical world often have continuous action spaces not amenable to discrete abstraction, rendering no-regret algorithms with $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{A}|)$ complexity not scalable. To address this challenge within the scope of two-player zero-sum (2p0s) games with one-sided information, we show that (1) a computational complexity independent of $|\mathcal{A}|$ can be achieved by exploiting the convexification property of incomplete-information games and the Isaacs' condition that commonly holds for dynamical systems, and that (2) the computation of the two equilibrium strategies can be decoupled under one-sidedness of information. Leveraging these insights, we develop an algorithm that successfully approximates the optimal strategy in a homing game.

      <title>Bootstrapping Fisher Market Equilibrium and First-Price Pacing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear Fisher market (LFM) is a basic equilibrium model from economics, which also has applications in fair and efficient resource allocation. First-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) is a model capturing budget-management mechanisms in first-price auctions. In certain practical settings such as advertising auctions, there is an interest in performing statistical inference over these models. A popular methodology for general statistical inference is the bootstrap procedure. Yet, for LFM and FPPE there is no existing theory for the valid application of bootstrap procedures. In this paper, we introduce and devise several statistically valid bootstrap inference procedures for LFM and FPPE. The most challenging part is to bootstrap general FPPE, which reduces to bootstrapping constrained M-estimators, a largely unexplored problem. We devise a bootstrap procedure for FPPE under mild degeneracy conditions by using the powerful tool of epi-convergence theory. Experiments with synthetic and semi-real data verify our theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Semi-Gradient Descent for Learning Mean Field Games with Population-Aware Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) model interactions in large-population multi-agent systems through population distributions. Traditional learning methods for MFGs are based on fixed-point iteration (FPI), where policy updates and induced population distributions are computed separately and sequentially. However, FPI-type methods may suffer from inefficiency and instability due to potential oscillations caused by this forward-backward procedure. In this work, we propose a novel perspective that treats the policy and population as a unified parameter controlling the game dynamics. By applying stochastic parameter approximation to this unified parameter, we develop SemiSGD, a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-type method, where an agent updates its policy and population estimates simultaneously and fully asynchronously. Building on this perspective, we further apply linear function approximation (LFA) to the unified parameter, resulting in the first population-aware LFA (PA-LFA) for learning MFGs on continuous state-action spaces. A comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis is provided for SemiSGD with PA-LFA, including its convergence to the equilibrium for linear MFGs -- a class of MFGs with a linear structure concerning the population -- under the standard contractivity condition, and to a neighborhood of the equilibrium under a more practical condition. We also characterize the approximation error for non-linear MFGs. We validate our theoretical findings with six experiments on three MFGs.</description>
