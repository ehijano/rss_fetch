      <title>Incorporating Missingness in a Framework for Generating Realistic Synthetic Randomized Controlled Trial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current literature regarding generation of complex, realistic synthetic tabular data, particularly for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often ignores missing data. However, missing data are common in RCT data and often are not Missing Completely At Random. We bridge the gap of determining how best to generate realistic synthetic data while also accounting for the missingness mechanism. We demonstrate how to generate synthetic missing values while ensuring that synthetic data mimic the targeted real data distribution. We propose and empirically compare several data generation frameworks utilizing various strategies for handling missing data (complete case, inverse probability weighting, and multiple imputation) by quantifying generation performance through a range of metrics. Focusing on the Missing At Random setting, we find that incorporating additional models to account for the missingness always outperformed a complete case approach.</description>

      <title>Subgroup Validity in Machine Learning for Echocardiogram Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echocardiogram datasets enable training deep learning models to automate interpretation of cardiac ultrasound, thereby expanding access to accurate readings of diagnostically-useful images. However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.</description>

      <title>Interpret the estimand framework from a causal inference perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimand framework proposed by ICH in 2017 has brought fundamental changes in the pharmaceutical industry. It clearly describes how a treatment effect in a clinical question should be precisely defined and estimated, through attributes including treatments, endpoints and intercurrent events. However, ideas around the estimand framework are commonly in text, and different interpretations on this framework may exist. This article aims to interpret the estimand framework through its underlying theories, the causal inference framework based on potential outcomes. The statistical origin and formula of an estimand is given through the causal inference framework, with all attributes translated into statistical terms. We describe how five strategies proposed by ICH to analyze intercurrent events are incorporated in the statistical formula of an estimand, and we also suggest a new strategy to analyze intercurrent events. The roles of target populations and analysis sets in the estimand framework are compared and discussed based on the statistical formula of an estimand. This article recommends continuing studying causal inference theories behind the estimand framework and improving the estimand framework with greater methodological comprehensibility and availability.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust against partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, when the model is misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, such as careless respondents. To this end, the estimator minimizes a robust loss function based on the divergence between observed frequencies and theoretical frequencies implied by the polychoric model. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation, is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed, and comes at no additional computational cost. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>
