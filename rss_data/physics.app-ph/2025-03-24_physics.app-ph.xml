      <title>2D Spintronics for Neuromorphic Computing with Scalability and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale. This work highlights technologies with ultra-low energy consumption (0.14 fJ/operation), high switching speeds (sub-nanosecond), and scalability to sub-20 nm footprints. It covers key material innovations and the role of spintronic effects in enabling compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, next-generation computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum ATK Analysis and Detection of Toxic Gases Nitrogen Oxide using Pristine, Defective, and Doped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</description>

      <title>The effect of longitudinal debonding on stress redistributions around fiber breaks: Incorporating fiber diameter distribution and fiber misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the influence of interfacial debonding between a broken fiber and matrix on stress redistribution surrounding a fiber break within a unidirectional (UD) impregnated fiber bundle, accounting for misalignment of fibers and fiber diameter distribution in randomly packed fiber configurations. Finite-element modelling is conducted on carbon-reinforced epoxy UD bundles with one fiber broken for different combinations of the bundle parameters: aligned/misaligned fibers and constant/randomly distributed fiber diameters. Two definitions of stress concentration factor (SCF) are examined, based on average and maximum stress over the fiber cross-section. The study reveals a statistically significant difference for average SCF for misaligned bundles with both constant and variable diameters of fibers compared to the case of aligned bundles of fibers with constant diameter. When the calculated SCFs are incorporated in a bundle strength model, the failure strain of unidirectional composites can be more realistically predicted.</description>

      <title>Microfabrication of a 16 MHz 1D-pMUT-Array for photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the complete fabrication process of a 1D piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer (pMUT) array operating at 16 MHz underwater. We demonstrate the applicability of this pMUT Array in medical imaging using photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and ultrasound imaging (USI) experiments. There are 16 individual pMUT devices in the array, the radius of each device is 25 microns with a pitch of 100 microns (centre-to-centre). A 1-micron thick AlN (Aluminium Nitride) thin film is the piezoelectric material of choice for our pMUT array. This thin film was achieved by improving upon the control parameters in RF magnetron sputtering process. The working of this pMUT was validated by performing optical, electrical, and acoustic characterization. The 1D pMUT array was characterized optically using Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) wherein the pMUT membrane showcased displacement of 6.2 pm/V for the in-air measurements at resonance of 20 MHz, the resonance frequency underwater was 16.2 MHz, with an effective displacement of 2.08 pm/V. Electrical characteristics were obtained through lock-in amplifier measurements, these were in close match to LDV results. Acoustical characteristics of the array was obtained through imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>On-chip calibration of Microscale-Thermocouples for Precise Temperature Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise temperature measurement at micro/nanoscale is crucial across various domains including physical sciences, chemical processes, industrial production, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, electronics, and biology. Micro/nanoscale thermal mapping requires precise techniques such as thermocouples, resistance-based devices, infrared thermography, optical interferometry, Raman thermometry, and Time domain-thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Each method has its advantages and limitations, emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate technique. Among these methods, micro-thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) offer a compelling solution due to their direct contact-based temperature measurements, minimal surface preparation requirements, lower cost, and robustness against environmental factors. Thermocouples work on the well-established Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated proportional to the temperature difference between two points. However, at micro/nanoscale, the Seebeck coefficients of thermocouples differ from those in bulk materials, requiring experimental calibration for precise measurements. To address this, we introduce an on-chip characterization platform with a differential temperature measurement setup on a borosilicate glass substrate. This platform utilizes a microheater as a localized heat source to elevate the temperature at the hot junction of the TFTC while maintaining the cold junction at ambient conditions. Numerical simulations are employed to engineer both the microheater and TFTC junction for precise temperature control. The functionality of this platform is validated by fabricating TFTCs using standard fabrication processes and measuring the TFTC response to determine the differential Seebeck coefficient of a Platinum-Chromium TFTC Junction. The calculated sensitivity of Pt/Cr TFTCs using this calibration method is 19.23 +- 0.405 {\mu}V/C.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry in Causality Constraints for Enhanced Acoustic Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalized causality constraint for acoustic reflection and transmission for a flat slab with finite thickness, via the duality transformation. It is known that achieving the upper limit of the causality constraint necessitates a critical coupling condition to optimize absorption bandwidth within a specified material thickness. However, the importance of duality symmetry has been overlooked in this context. Our analytical model demonstrates that optimal absorption in a 2-port setup not only relies on the well-established critical coupling but also requires duality symmetry, defined as the invariance under duality transformation. To verify our theoretical prediction, we have experimentally realized customized metamaterials that exhibit quasi-duality symmetry. This was achieved by inducing global degeneracy between the first-order monopole and dipole resonances, consequently realizing an exceptionally large sound absorption capacity as permitted by the proposed causality constraint. Our findings elucidate the intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality, and they facilitate the exploitation of the untapped potential in existing passive absorbers for wave transport control.</description>

      <title>Design of an aluminum nitride based electro-optic phase modulator and photonic switch for next generation scalable photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators are fundamental components in atomic physics experiments, including trapped-ion systems used in precision metrology and quantum computing. To enable scalable photonic integration, we design and analyze an integrated photonic electro-optic phase modulator and switch at 411 nm for ytterbium ($Yb^{+}$) ions using aluminum nitride (AlN) waveguides. We employ finite element method (FEM) simulations to optimize optical confinement, RF impedance matching, and electro-optic modulation efficiency. The phase modulator achieves a DC $V_{\pi}L$ of 178 V cm for TE polarization. The photonic switch, designed with a push-pull electrode configuration, demonstrates a $V_{\pi}L$ of 24 V cm, enabling efficient operation at lower voltages. These results highlight AlN as a candidate for ultraviolet photonic integrated circuits, facilitating high-speed optical modulation for trapped-ion applications.</description>

      <title>Diving deep into the Milky Way using Anti-Reflection Coatings for Astronomical CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two anti-reflection (AR) coatings that give better quantum efficiency (QE) than the existing AR coating on the Gaia astrometric field (AF) CCDs. Light being the core of optical astronomy is extremely important for such missions, therefore, the QE of the devices that are used to capture it should be substantially high. To reduce the losses due to the reflection of light from the surface of the CCDs, AR coatings can be applied. Currently, the main component of the Gaia satellite, the AF CCDs use hafnium dioxide (HfO2) AR coating. In this paper, the ATLAS module of the SILVACO software has been employed for simulating and studying the AF CCD pixel structure and several AR coatings. Our findings evidently suggest that zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) will prove to be better AR coatings for broadband astronomical CCDs in the future and will open new avenues for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Dependent \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode with Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Grown NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports the demonstration of ALD-deposited NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) on low doped drift layer and highly doped (001) &amp; (100) n+ substrates with experimental observation of a parallel-plane junction electric field as high as 7.5 MV/cm, revealing a crystal orientation dependence in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We use a novel metalorganic precursor bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to deposit NiO. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD on 7.7 {\mu}m-thick HVPE-grown drift region exhibited an on-state current density of ~20 A/cm2 at 5 V, ~10-8 A/cm2 reverse leakage at low reverse bias(-5 V), and a rectifying ratio(Jon/Joff) of ~109. The HJD broke down at ~2.2 kV reverse bias, corresponding to a ~3.4 MV/cm parallel-plane junction electric field, with a noise floor reverse leakage (10-8~10-6 A/cm2, nA) at 80% of the device catastrophic breakdown voltage. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs on n+ (001) &amp; (100) highly-doped substrates exhibited breakdown voltages at 12.5-16.0 V and 28.5-70.5 V, respectively, with extracted critical electric field (EC) at 2.30-2.76 MV/cm, and 4.33-7.50 MV/cm, revealing a substrate crystal orientation dependence on breakdown electric field for \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The 7.5 MV/cm EC reported here is one of the highest parallel-plane junction electric fields reported in literature.</description>

      <title>Subvolt high-speed free-space modulator with electro-optic metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces incorporating electro-optic (EO) materials enable high-speed free-space optical modulators that show great promise for a wide range of emerging applications, including free-space optical communication, light detection and ranging, and optical computing. However, the limited light-matter interaction lengths in ultrathin metasurfaces typically require high driving voltages exceeding tens of volts. Here we present ultralow-voltage, high-speed free-space optical modulators based on silicon-organic-hybrid metasurfaces with dimerized-grating-based nanostructures. By exploiting a high-Q quasi-bound state in the continuum, normally incident light is effectively trapped within a submicrometer-scale silicon slot region embedded with organic EO material. Consequently, highly efficient modulation is obtained, enabling data transmission at 50 Mbps and 1.6 Gbps with driving voltages of only 0.2 V and 1 V, respectively. These unprecedented metasurface modulators operating at complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible voltage levels provide the pathway toward energy-efficient high-speed active metasurface devices.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the intrinsic sensitivity for a single-ended accelerometer without the influence of the mounting condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calibration technique for accelerometers has been internationally developed for up to 20 kHz to ensure the reliability of vibration measurement. However, it has been established that the calibrated sensitivity changes at over 10 kHz depending on the mounting conditions, and this makes it difficult to accurately measure the characteristics of accelerometers and degrades the accuracy of high-frequency vibration measurements. Thus, in this study, we developed a reversed-calibration method for measuring the intrinsic sensitivity of an accelerometer without the influence of the mounting conditions. Through demonstration experiment, the intrinsic resonance structure of the accelerometer at approximately 45.8 kHz was adequately determined. Furthermore, the result was independently confirmed by fitting the conventional adapter-calibration results up to 100 kHz with four different materials based on the dynamic three-body model. Concurrently, the material dependency observed during adapter calibration was quantitatively analyzed, after which its relationship with the Young's modulus was extracted. Overall, these results deepen our understanding of the performance of the accelerometer at above 10 kHz, which is essential in vibration metrology and accelerometer development.</description>

      <title>Mie resonances in optical trapping: Their role in kinematics and back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heating rate plays a crucial role in the decoherence of the harmonic motion of an optically levitated nanoparticle. The values of this rate vary depending on both the scattering photon rate and the kinetic energy acquired through individual photon recoils. While the combined roles of these factors have been extensively studied, the energy transfer per recoil has not been explicitly examined. This energy transfer is often approximated using a linear dipole model with coefficients $\{1/5, 2/5, 7/5\}$ which applies in the Rayleigh limit. In this work, we analyze the evolution of energy transfer per photon recoil for low-absorption dielectric nanospheres with diameters ranging from 2 nm to 500 nm. Using a far-field approximation, we demonstrate that the Kerker condition, which enhances the alignment between incident and scattered wavevectors, may significantly reduce the energy transferred per recoil. Although this reduction is counterbalanced by the increasing scattering rate, for an individual scattering event, the reduction of recoil suggests an intrinsic suppression of back-action. Our results reveal a potential enhancement in the accuracy of estimations in tabletop experiments involving Mie particles of the considered sizes and provide guidance for the selection of optimal probe sizes and materials. Our interpretation of recoil reduction as a manifestation of back-action suppression indicates the potential for quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements by tailoring scattered radiation patterns with metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Graph Reasoning Evolves into a Critical State for Continuous Discovery Through Structural-Semantic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observe anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated because of the implied symmetries between the two steady states, on the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition mode under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effects are no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</description>

      <title>A superconducting full-wave bridge rectifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting thin-film electronics are attractive for their low power consumption, fast operating speeds, and ease of interface with cryogenic systems such as single-photon detector arrays, and quantum computing devices. However, the lack of a reliable superconducting two-terminal asymmetric device, analogous to a semiconducting diode, limits the development of power-handling circuits, fundamental for scaling up these technologies. Existing efforts to date have been limited to single-diode proofs of principle and lacked integration of multiple controllable and reproducible devices to form complex circuits. Here, we demonstrate a robust superconducting diode with tunable polarity using the asymmetric vortex surface barrier in niobium nitride micro-bridges, achieving a 43% peak rectification efficiency, and showing half-wave rectification up to 120 MHz. We then realize and integrate several such diodes into a bridge rectifier circuit on a single microchip that performs continuous full-wave rectification up to 3 MHz and AC-to-DC conversion of a 50 MHz signal in periodic bursts with an estimated peak power efficiency of 50%.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Embedded Element Patterns of Reactively Loaded Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06291v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing reactively loaded antennas and antenna arrays. The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Toward Carnot efficient high output power heat engines using bubbly two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic gas power cycles achieving Carnot efficiency require isothermal expansion, which is associated with slow processes and results in negligible power output. This study proposes a practical method for rapid near-isothermal gas expansion, facilitating efficient heat engines without sacrificing power. The method involves bubble expansion in a heat transfer liquid, ensuring efficient and near-isothermal heat exchange. The mixture is accelerated through a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy, thereby rotating a reaction turbine for electricity generation. Nozzle experiments with air and water yielded a polytropic index &lt;1.052, enabling up to 71% more work extraction than adiabatic expansion. Simulations indicate that utilizing these nozzles for thrust generation enables decreasing heat transfer irreversibilities in the heat engine, consequently resulting in up to 22.6% higher power output than an ideal heat engine based on the organic Rankine cycle. This work paves the way for an efficient and high-power heat-to-power solution.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. An effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods is presented. The calculated matrices are small matrices; and this allows to use effectively JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which allows to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. The complexity of developing an implementation based on the proposed approach does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation. Performance analysis using roofline partly explains the observed features of the decreasing of computational costs.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Onset of wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Unilateral vibration transmission in mechanical systems with bilinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics.</description>
