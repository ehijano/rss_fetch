      <title>Forecasting Intraday Volume in Equity Markets with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on forecasting intraday trading volumes, a crucial component for portfolio implementation, especially in high-frequency (HF) trading environments. Given the current scarcity of flexible methods in this area, we employ a suite of machine learning (ML) models enriched with numerous HF predictors to enhance the predictability of intraday trading volumes. Our findings reveal that intraday stock trading volume is highly predictable, especially with ML and considering commonality. Additionally, we assess the economic benefits of accurate volume forecasting through Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. The results demonstrate that precise intraday forecasting offers substantial advantages, providing valuable insights for traders to optimize their strategies.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Multi-scale Leverage Effect Estimator under Dependent Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data is vital but challenged by complex, dependent microstructure noise, often exhibiting non-Gaussian higher-order moments. This paper introduces a novel multi-scale framework for efficient and robust leverage effect estimation under such flexible noise structures. We develop two new estimators, the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE), which adapt subsampling and multi-scale approaches holistically using a unique shifted window technique. This design simplifies the multi-scale estimation procedure and enhances noise robustness without requiring the pre-averaging approach. We establish central limit theorems and stable convergence, with MSLE achieving convergence rates of an optimal $n^{-1/4}$ and a near-optimal $n^{-1/9}$ for the noise-free and noisy settings, respectively. A cornerstone of our framework's efficiency is a specifically designed MSLE weighting strategy that leverages covariance structures across scales. This significantly reduces asymptotic variance and, critically, yields substantially smaller finite-sample errors than existing methods under both noise-free and realistic noisy settings. Extensive simulations and empirical analyses confirm the superior efficiency, robustness, and practical advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>TradExpert: Revolutionizing Trading with Mixture of Expert LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial domain has opened new avenues for quantitative trading, particularly through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the challenge of effectively synthesizing insights from diverse data sources and integrating both structured and unstructured data persists. This paper presents TradeExpert, a novel framework that employs a mix of experts (MoE) approach, using four specialized LLMs, each analyzing distinct sources of financial data, including news articles, market data, alpha factors, and fundamental data. The insights of these expert LLMs are further synthesized by a General Expert LLM to make a final prediction or decision. With specific prompts, TradeExpert can be switched between the prediction mode and the ranking mode for stock movement prediction and quantitative stock trading, respectively. In addition to existing benchmarks, we also release a large-scale financial dataset to comprehensively evaluate TradeExpert's effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate TradeExpert's superior performance across all trading scenarios.</description>
