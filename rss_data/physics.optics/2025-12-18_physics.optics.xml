      <title>Ultrasensitive Polarization-Resolved Probing of Transient Dynamics in MoS$_2$ on Silicon Nitride Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ultrasensitive technique for probing transient optical changes in atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) layers integrated onto silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ring resonators. The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for investigating polarization-dependent nonlinear effects, with applications in photonics, sensing, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian point gap in photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian point gap (NHPG) is a unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems and induces non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In photonic crystals, NHPG and the NHSE have previously been explored mainly through material loss, where the typically low $Q$ factors make direct observation of complex frequencies challenging. Here, we demonstrate the direct experimental observation of an NHPG by using a radiation-loss-based non-Hermitian photonic crystal. Radiation loss can be engineered through structural design, enabling control of the imaginary part of the complex frequency and allowing relatively high $Q$ factors. This approach is compatible with widely used absorption-free silicon-slab photonic crystals. We developed a measurement system that can measure photonic bands along arbitrary lines in $k$-space. Our measurements demonstrated direct observation of the NHPG in photonic crystals, and the reversal of non-Hermitian topology through the flip of loop rotation in a complex plane. Our platform, which requires neither gain media nor synthetic dimensions, establishes radiation-loss engineering as a simple and versatile route for photonic functionality using an NHSE in nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <title>Structural color palette of disordered colloids in the Rayleigh scattering regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural coloration by Rayleigh scattering is widespread in nature and holds a prominent place in various art objects over a broad period of time, from ancient Chinese porcelains to Renaissance paintings. Beyond the common statement that Rayleigh scattering is the primary mechanism behind the multiple colored appearances of the sky, it appears that the relationship between material parameters and the colors that appear in different observation conditions has not been thoroughly explored so far. The present study aims to offer a general overview of the structural colors accessible by Rayleigh scattering as a function of the material parameters, alongside a scalable and environment-friendly process to realize solid composite materials with targeted structural colors in reflection and transmission. Monte Carlo light transport simulations are performed to compute the structural color palette of disordered colloids -- dielectric particles in a nonscattering matrix -- in different observation modes. In particular, we provide a range of physical parameters in which the materials exhibit the same blue color in diffuse reflection and transmission. We also show that, as may be counterintuitive at first, the addition of black absorbents to the matrix of a white (opaque) material can lead to the emergence of a blue coloration in diffuse reflection, thanks to the interplay between multiple light scattering and light absorption. These predictions are validated by optical experiments on colloidal suspensions of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (ZrO$_2$:Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The potential of Rayleigh-scattering materials for visual arts and design is further supported by realizing solid-state composites based on abundant materials, namely borosilicate clays and hybrid silica-based glasses, using soft chemistry at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Integrated on-chip quantum light sources on a van der Waals platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable photonic quantum information technologies require a platform combining quantum light sources, waveguides, and detectors on a single chip. Here, we introduce a van der Waals platform comprising strain-engineered bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, integrated on multimode WS$_2$ waveguides with optimized grating couplers, enabling efficient on-chip quantum light sources. The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Orientation-dependent high harmonic generation in ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally investigate orientation-dependent high-harmonic generation (HHG) in zinc oxide subjected to intense femtosecond mid-infrared (MIR) laser pulses. In agreement with past measurements from literature, we observe non-perturbative harmonic spectra with harmonics extending beyond the material band gap. The spectra depend sensitively on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the laser polarization direction. To benchmark the measurements, we performed detailed theoretical calculation of the orientation-dependent harmonic yields. The theory predicts a three-fold angular modulation of the intensity of odd-order harmonics in the (0001)-plane, which can be deduced from the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice alone, in contrast a four-fold symmetry is observed in the experiment. The theory points out the essential role of the anisotropy of the multiple band structure affecting the dynamics of electron-hole pair excitation and solid-state HHG.</description>

      <title>Towards coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This work represents a first step towards the realization of more complex, fully integrated, coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Non-linear X-ray Coherent Diffractive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of nonlinear X-ray processes like sum-frequency generation and four-wave mixing raises the possibility of non-linear X-ray imaging, combining the high-resolution and elemental specificity of X-ray imaging with the state selectivity and sensitivity of non-linear optical imaging. While scanning imaging methods may be feasible, for linear X-ray processes coherent diffractive imaging has emerged as a key approach, enabling lensless reconstruction of nanoscale structure and dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a coherent diffractive approach to imaging using X-ray nonlinear processes, introducing an analysis method to isolate the nonlinear component from the overall diffraction pattern by leveraging the property of mutual incoherence between different wavelengths. For examples such as sum-frequency generation in ferroelectrics, this method reveals both domain structure and orientation through the retrieved amplitude and phase of the nonlinear signal. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed method in the presence of experimental noise, most relevantly shot noise. This analysis method is applicable in both static and dynamic imaging, offering a pathway beyond traditional spectroscopy toward XUV/X-ray coherent imaging of spatio-temporal dynamics in quantum materials and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Fourier-Enhanced Deep Operator Network for Spatio-Temporal Propagation in Multi-Mode Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort-pulse propagation in graded-index multimode fibers is a highly nonlinear phenomenon driven by several physical processes. Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control. Moreover, the same framework can potentially be applied to a wide variety of wave systems exhibiting analogous nonlinear and dispersive effects in optics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Effect of PCA-Based Dimensionality Reduction on Machine Learning Performance in Hyperspectral Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral optical imaging provides rich spectral information for estimating continuous environmental and material parameters; however, its high dimensionality and strong feature correlation pose significant challenges for machine learning models, especially when ground-truth datasets are limited. In this study, we investigate a hyperspectral dataset composed of 150 spectral bands with soil moisture as the target variable. To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity. To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive performance, a Random Forest regression model was trained to estimate soil moisture from the PCA-transformed data. The model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 94.7 %, demonstrating that PCA-based feature reduction can enhance computational efficiency while preserving strong predictive capability in hyperspectral machine learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Unveiling nonlinearities of electromagnetically induced transparency in a THz metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in terahertz (THz) metamaterials relies on the coherent coupling between a radiative (bright) mode and a subradiant (dark) mode. Understanding the dynamic interplay between the bright and dark modes holds the key to manipulate the mutual interference and hence the transparency. Here, we use nonlinear 2D-THz spectroscopy to scrutinize the dynamics through nonlinearities of the EIT-like phenomenon in a metamaterial platform that comprises of two coupled resonators. From the temporal profiles of the nonlinear pump-probe and photon-echo signals, we found that the bright mode relaxation time is almost twice the time for the coherent exchange of energy between the two coupled resonators. The multi-peak nature of photon-echo signal and the corresponding temporal signatures further provides a direct visualization of the interference between the dressed states that drives the transparency window in our THz metamaterial. A time-resolved density matrix model accurately describes the observed features, including the cross-peak behavior and the temporal dynamics, establishing the coherent mode coupling as the origin of the transparency window.</description>

      <title>Photonics-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.</description>

      <title>Self-Quenching Effect of the Decay of Localized Surface Plasmons: Classical and Quantum Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a self-consistent, quantum-informed model for the decay dynamics of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in spherical metal nanoparticles (NPs), described as plasmonic quasi-particles (PQPs). By bridging classical electrodynamics description for quasi-normal modes (retardation effects included) with a quantum emitter perspective, this framework provides an analytically tractable description of the damping of the dissipative confined plasmonic systems. In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact. The derived self-consistent formulation offers analytical expressions for the total damping rates, which demonstrate a size-dependent suppression displayed in higher multipolarity modes attributed to the impact of the self-quenching effect resulting from the coaction of radiative and non-radiative channels.</description>

      <title>Guided vortex bullets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of the variational method and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the existence of stable 3D nonlinear modes, viz. vortex ``bullets'', in the form of pulsed beams carrying orbital angular momentum, that can self-trap in a 2D waveguiding structure. Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons.</description>

      <title>High-speed optical microscopy for neural voltage imaging: Methods, trade-offs, and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed optical imaging of dynamic neuronal activity is essential yet challenging in neuroscience. While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts. This review summarizes recent progress in high-speed optical microscopy for voltage imaging and discusses its transformative potential for neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Operators for Predicting 3D Electromagnetic Fields Transformed by Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, typically realized as arrays of nanopillars, transform electromagnetic (EM) fields depending on their geometry and spatial arrangement. For solving the inverse problem of designing new metasurfaces that transform EM fields in a desirable manner, it is often necessary to explore large design spaces through full-wave simulations that can be computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that neural operators, which are artificial neural network architectures designed to learn operators between function spaces, can effectively approximate the differential operators underlying Maxwell's equations, enabling their use as fast and accurate 3D surrogate models that can predict 3D EM fields transformed by metasurfaces. To calibrate neural operators, we generate synthetic training data consisting of 3D metasurface geometries together with their associated 3D EM fields obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. Using the generated synthetic data, we train physics-informed neural operators to minimize physical inconsistencies of predicted EM fields by incorporating residuals that capture deviations from Maxwell's equations. We observe that a training dataset consisting of fewer than 5000 examples already suffices to achieve reasonable results. In particular, our experiments show that the resulting 3D surrogate model achieves high predictive performance across a wide range of metasurface geometries, including types of structures not encountered during training. Notably, it predicts diffraction efficiencies with relative errors of 3.9 % and provides a 67-fold speedup compared to conventional 3D simulations. Overall, once trained, our 3D surrogate model can rapidly predict EM fields for previously unseen metasurface geometries, which can facilitate efficient gradient-based design of nanostructured materials for EM wave control.</description>

      <title>Site-selective enhancement of Eu emission in delta-doped GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Europium-doped gallium nitride (GaN:Eu) is a promising platform for classical and quantum optoelectronic applications. When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ab initio insights into plasmonic and strong-field contributions to H$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of photonic and phononic bandgaps within a single scalable architecture promises transformative advances in optomechanical and acousto-optic devices. Here, we design and simulate a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in silicon with air-gap holes that transition smoothly from circular to triangular via tuneable geometrical parameters including air-gap hole radius (R) and tether length (l). By independently varying these two parameters, we systematically explore diverse honeycomb lattice geometries and their bandgap properties. This transformation from circular to triangular air-gap holes enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps upto 49.7% and 24.8% respectively. This possibility of geometrically tuning bandgaps provide a strong foundation for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects or exotic materials.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Drift Correction For Complex Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To exploit the thousand-fold increase in spectral brightness of modern light sources, increasingly intricate experiments are being conducted that demand extremely precise beam trajectory. Maintaining the optimal trajectory over several hours of an experiment with the needed precision necessitates active drift control. Here, we outline Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) as a data driven approach for robust drift correction, and illustrate its application for a split and delay optical system composed of six crystals and twelve input dimensions. Using numerical simulations, we exhibit the application of TVBO for linear drift, non-smooth temporal drift as well as constrained TVBO for multi-objective control settings, representing real-life operating conditions. This approach can be easily adapted to other X-ray beam conditioning and guidance systems, including multi-crystal monochromators and grazing-incidence mirrors, to maintain sub-micron and nanoradian beam stability over the course of an experiment spanning several hours.</description>

      <title>Design of Carrier-Depletion-based Modulators on Commercially Available SOI Substrates of Varying Device-Layer Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare modulator designs on thick-film and thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates based on the carrier-depletion effect. This effect exhibits a lower junction capacitance as compared to its injection counterparts, leading to a higher electro-optic bandwidth, although the effective refractive index change is low. In this work, commercially available standard SOI substrates with device layer thicknesses of 5 {\mu}m, 3 {\mu}m, and 0.22 {\mu}m are chosen for designing carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, which are then utilized for the design of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). These MZMs are tested for various on-off-keying (OOK) modulation bit rates employing non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS). For the comparison of given designs, we find that the thick-film MZMs, which can provide higher fabrication tolerance and high power handling capabilities, support maximum modulation speeds in the order of a few Gbps, whereas it can go up to 20 Gbps for thin-film MZMs.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortices: Revolutionizing the field of linear and nonlinear optics</title>

Abstract: Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum (both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging, and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrathin plasmonic films that approach the trans-dimensional (TD) thickness limit provide a promising route for light_matter interaction control and manipulation, yet their nonlinear optical response near the epsilon_near_zero (ENZ) condition remains poorly understood. Here, we report the strongly enhanced optical nonlinearity for their typical representative high quality TiN epitaxial films with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems. Comparison with Ti1_xAlxN highlights the necessity of low-loss ENZ response for nonlinear enhancement. These findings identify TiN and similar TD plasmonic systems as a robust refractory platform for exploiting ENZ mediated nonlinear processes in ultrathin photonic material structures.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulations of the Non-Resonant Open Tavis-Cummings Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The open Tavis--Cummings model consists of $N$ quantum emitters interacting with a common cavity mode, accounts for losses and decoherence, and is frequently explored for quantum information processing and designing quantum devices. As $N$ increases, it becomes harder to simulate the open Tavis--Cummings model using traditional methods. To address this problem, we implement two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of this model in the inhomogeneous, non-resonant regime, with up to three excitations in the cavity. We show that the implemented algorithms have gate complexities that scale polynomially, as $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$, while the number of qubits used by these algorithms (space complexity) scales linearly as $O(N)$. One of these algorithms is the sampling-based wave matrix Lindbladization algorithm, for which we propose two protocols to implement its system-independent fixed interaction, resolving key open questions of [Patel and Wilde, Open Sys. &amp; Info. Dyn., 30:2350014 (2023)]. We benchmark our results against a classical differential equation solver in a variety of scenarios and demonstrate that our algorithms accurately reproduce the expected dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of optical tweezers form the backbone of neutral atoms analog and digital quantum processors. However, the inter-trap distance remains generally much larger than the size of the tweezers to avoid interference-induced trap distortions, limiting the trap density. Here, we report single-atom trapping in four super-resolved tweezers, meaning with a separation below the Sparrow diffraction limit. The optical pattern is generated using superoscillatory phenomenon leading to subwavelength traps with full control of the trap relative phases. We investigate two sets of relative phases that impede or allow the hopping and the reshuffling of atoms. We envision that superoscillatory light structuring will bridge the gap between large-distance traps generated by tweezer arrays and short-distance traps formed with optical lattices.</description>
