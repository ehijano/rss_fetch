      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a review of typical techniques used in three distinct aspects of deep learning model development for audio generation. In the first part of the article, we provide an explanation of audio representations, beginning with the fundamental audio waveform. We then progress to the frequency domain, with an emphasis on the attributes of human hearing, and finally introduce a relatively recent development. The main part of the article focuses on explaining basic and extended deep learning architecture variants, along with their practical applications in the field of audio generation. The following architectures are addressed: 1) Autoencoders 2) Generative adversarial networks 3) Normalizing flows 4) Transformer networks 5) Diffusion models. Lastly, we will examine four distinct evaluation metrics that are commonly employed in audio generation. This article aims to offer novice readers and beginners in the field a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art in audio generation methods as well as relevant studies that can be explored for future research.</description>

      <title>Creative Text-to-Audio Generation via Synthesizer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio synthesis methods now allow specifying ideas in natural language. However, these methods produce results that cannot be easily tweaked, as they are based on large latent spaces and up to billions of uninterpretable parameters. We propose a text-to-audio generation method that leverages a virtual modular sound synthesizer with only 78 parameters. Synthesizers have long been used by skilled sound designers for media like music and film due to their flexibility and intuitive controls. Our method, CTAG, iteratively updates a synthesizer's parameters to produce high-quality audio renderings of text prompts that can be easily inspected and tweaked. Sounds produced this way are also more abstract, capturing essential conceptual features over fine-grained acoustic details, akin to how simple sketches can vividly convey visual concepts. Our results show how CTAG produces sounds that are distinctive, perceived as artistic, and yet similarly identifiable to recent neural audio synthesis models, positioning it as a valuable and complementary tool.</description>

      <title>Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io .</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in End-to-End Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) is a demanding task that involves generating translations in real-time while continuously processing speech input. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in SimulST research, focusing on four major challenges. Firstly, the complexities associated with processing lengthy and continuous speech streams pose significant hurdles. Secondly, satisfying real-time requirements presents inherent difficulties due to the need for immediate translation output. Thirdly, striking a balance between translation quality and latency constraints remains a critical challenge. Finally, the scarcity of annotated data adds another layer of complexity to the task. Through our exploration of these challenges and the proposed solutions, we aim to provide valuable insights into the current landscape of SimulST research and suggest promising directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Classification of Heart Sounds Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients: A Comparative Study of Single and Ensemble Classifier Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in detecting abnormal phonocardiograms using two classification strategies: a single-classifier and an ensemble-classifier approach. Phonocardiograms were segmented into S1, systole, S2, and diastole intervals, with thirteen MFCCs estimated from each segment, yielding 52 MFCCs per beat. In the single-classifier strategy, the MFCCs from nine consecutive beats were averaged to classify phonocardiograms. Conversely, the ensemble-classifier strategy employed nine classifiers to individually assess beats as normal or abnormal, with the overall classification based on the majority vote. Both methods were tested on a publicly available phonocardiogram database. Results demonstrated that the ensemble-classifier strategy achieved higher accuracy compared to the single-classifier approach, establishing MFCCs as more effective than other features, including time, time-frequency, and statistical features, evaluated in similar studies.</description>

      <title>Phonetic Error Analysis of Raw Waveform Acoustic Models with Parametric and Non-Parametric CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the error patterns of the raw waveform acoustic models in TIMIT's phone recognition task. Our analysis goes beyond the conventional phone error rate (PER) metric. We categorise the phones into three groups: {affricate, diphthong, fricative, nasal, plosive, semi-vowel, vowel, silence}, {consonant, vowel+, silence}, and {voiced, unvoiced, silence} and, compute the PER for each broad phonetic class in each category. We also construct a confusion matrix for each category using the substitution errors and compare the confusion patterns with those of the Filterbank and Wav2vec 2.0 systems. Our raw waveform acoustic models consists of parametric (Sinc2Net) or non-parametric CNNs and Bidirectional LSTMs, achieving down to 13.7%/15.2% PERs on TIMIT Dev/Test sets, outperforming reported PERs for raw waveform models in the literature. We also investigate the impact of transfer learning from WSJ on the phonetic error patterns and confusion matrices. It reduces the PER to 11.8%/13.7% on the Dev/Test sets.</description>

      <title>Searching For Music Mixing Graphs: A Pruning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music mixing is compositional -- experts combine multiple audio processors to achieve a cohesive mix from dry source tracks. We propose a method to reverse engineer this process from the input and output audio. First, we create a mixing console that applies all available processors to every chain. Then, after the initial console parameter optimization, we alternate between removing redundant processors and fine-tuning. We achieve this through differentiable implementation of both processors and pruning. Consequently, we find a sparse mixing graph that achieves nearly identical matching quality of the full mixing console. We apply this procedure to dry-mix pairs from various datasets and collect graphs that also can be used to train neural networks for music mixing applications.</description>

      <title>animal2vec and MeerKAT: A self-supervised transformer for rare-event raw audio input and a large-scale reference dataset for bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioacoustic research provides invaluable insights into the behavior, ecology, and conservation of animals. Most bioacoustic datasets consist of long recordings where events of interest, such as vocalizations, are exceedingly rare. Analyzing these datasets poses a monumental challenge to researchers, where deep learning techniques have emerged as a standard method. Their adaptation remains challenging, focusing on models conceived for computer vision, where the audio waveforms are engineered into spectrographic representations for training and inference. We improve the current state of deep learning in bioacoustics in two ways: First, we present the animal2vec framework: a fully interpretable transformer model and self-supervised training scheme tailored for sparse and unbalanced bioacoustic data. Second, we openly publish MeerKAT: Meerkat Kalahari Audio Transcripts, a large-scale dataset containing audio collected via biologgers deployed on free-ranging meerkats with a length of over 1068h, of which 184h have twelve time-resolved vocalization-type classes, each with ms-resolution, making it the largest publicly-available labeled dataset on terrestrial mammals. Further, we benchmark animal2vec against the NIPS4Bplus birdsong dataset. We report new state-of-the-art results on both datasets and evaluate the few-shot capabilities of animal2vec of labeled training data. Finally, we perform ablation studies to highlight the differences between our architecture and a vanilla transformer baseline for human-produced sounds. animal2vec allows researchers to classify massive amounts of sparse bioacoustic data even with little ground truth information available. In addition, the MeerKAT dataset is the first large-scale, millisecond-resolution corpus for benchmarking bioacoustic models in the pretrain/finetune paradigm. We believe this sets the stage for a new reference point for bioacoustics.</description>

      <title>Sequence-to-Sequence Multi-Modal Speech In-Painting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech in-painting is the task of regenerating missing audio contents using reliable context information. Despite various recent studies in multi-modal perception of audio in-painting, there is still a need for an effective infusion of visual and auditory information in speech in-painting. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence model that leverages the visual information to in-paint audio signals via an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder plays the role of a lip-reader for facial recordings and the decoder takes both encoder outputs as well as the distorted audio spectrograms to restore the original speech. Our model outperforms an audio-only speech in-painting model and has comparable results with a recent multi-modal speech in-painter in terms of speech quality and intelligibility metrics for distortions of 300 ms to 1500 ms duration, which proves the effectiveness of the introduced multi-modality in speech in-painting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CrossVoice, a novel cascade-based Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) system employing advanced ASR, MT, and TTS technologies with cross-lingual prosody preservation through transfer learning. We conducted comprehensive experiments comparing CrossVoice with direct-S2ST systems, showing improved BLEU scores on tasks such as Fisher Es-En, VoxPopuli Fr-En and prosody preservation on benchmark datasets CVSS-T and IndicTTS. With an average mean opinion score of 3.75 out of 4, speech synthesized by CrossVoice closely rivals human speech on the benchmark, highlighting the efficacy of cascade-based systems and transfer learning in multilingual S2ST with prosody transfer.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Prosody Transfer: Comparing Supervised &amp; Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of prosody transfer in speech synthesis systems is rapidly advancing. This research is focused on evaluating learning methods for adapting pre-trained monolingual text-to-speech (TTS) models to multilingual conditions, i.e., Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Transfer Learning (TL). This comparison utilizes three distinct metrics: Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Recognition Accuracy (RA), and Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD). Results demonstrate that, in comparison to SFT, TL leads to significantly enhanced performance, with an average MOS higher by 1.53 points, a 37.5% increase in RA, and approximately a 7.8-point improvement in MCD. These findings are instrumental in helping build TTS models for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>AudioLCM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have propelled them to the forefront of various generative tasks. However, their iterative sampling process poses a significant computational burden, resulting in slow generation speeds and limiting their application in text-to-audio generation deployment. In this work, we introduce AudioLCM, a novel consistency-based model tailored for efficient and high-quality text-to-audio generation. AudioLCM integrates Consistency Models into the generation process, facilitating rapid inference through a mapping from any point at any time step to the trajectory's initial point. To overcome the convergence issue inherent in LDMs with reduced sample iterations, we propose the Guided Latent Consistency Distillation with a multi-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. This innovation shortens the time schedule from thousands to dozens of steps while maintaining sample quality, thereby achieving fast convergence and high-quality generation. Furthermore, to optimize the performance of transformer-based neural network architectures, we integrate the advanced techniques pioneered by LLaMA into the foundational framework of transformers. This architecture supports stable and efficient training, ensuring robust performance in text-to-audio synthesis. Experimental results on text-to-sound generation and text-to-music synthesis tasks demonstrate that AudioLCM needs only 2 iterations to synthesize high-fidelity audios, while it maintains sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps. AudioLCM enables a sampling speed of 333x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU, making generative models practically applicable to text-to-audio generation deployment. Our extensive preliminary analysis shows that each design in AudioLCM is effective.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Text-Conditioned Music Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a multimodal neural network trained on (text, image) pairs to predict the most relevant text caption given an image. It has been used extensively in image generation by connecting its output with a generative model such as VQGAN, with the most notable example being OpenAI's DALLE-2. In this project, we apply a similar approach to bridge the gap between natural language and music. Our model is split into two steps: first, we train a CLIP-like model on pairs of text and music over contrastive loss to align a piece of music with its most probable text caption. Then, we combine the alignment model with a music decoder to generate music. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at text-conditioned deep music generation. Our experiments show that it is possible to train the text-music alignment model using contrastive loss and train a decoder to generate music from text prompts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Zero-shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-speech (TTS) technology has witnessed impressive advancements, particularly with large-scale training datasets, showcasing human-level speech quality and impressive zero-shot capabilities on unseen speakers. However, despite human subjective evaluations, such as the mean opinion score (MOS), remaining the gold standard for assessing the quality of synthetic speech, even state-of-the-art TTS approaches have kept human feedback isolated from training that resulted in mismatched training objectives and evaluation metrics. In this work, we investigate a novel topic of integrating subjective human evaluation into the TTS training loop. Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning from human feedback, we propose a comprehensive sampling-annotating-learning framework tailored to TTS optimization, namely uncertainty-aware optimization (UNO). Specifically, UNO eliminates the need for a reward model or preference data by directly maximizing the utility of speech generations while considering the uncertainty that lies in the inherent variability in subjective human speech perception and evaluations. Experimental results of both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that UNO considerably improves the zero-shot performance of TTS models in terms of MOS, word error rate, and speaker similarity. Additionally, we present a remarkable ability of UNO that it can adapt to the desired speaking style in emotional TTS seamlessly and flexibly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce YODAS (YouTube-Oriented Dataset for Audio and Speech), a large-scale, multilingual dataset comprising currently over 500k hours of speech data in more than 100 languages, sourced from both labeled and unlabeled YouTube speech datasets. The labeled subsets, including manual or automatic subtitles, facilitate supervised model training. Conversely, the unlabeled subsets are apt for self-supervised learning applications. YODAS is distinctive as the first publicly available dataset of its scale, and it is distributed under a Creative Commons license. We introduce the collection methodology utilized for YODAS, which contributes to the large-scale speech dataset construction. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of speech, text contained within the dataset. Finally, we describe the speech recognition baselines over the top-15 languages.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Modal Speech In-Painting: A Sequence-to-Sequence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of reconstructing missing parts of speech audio from context is called speech in-painting. Human perception of speech is inherently multi-modal, involving both audio and visual (AV) cues. In this paper, we introduce and study a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) speech in-painting model that incorporates AV features. Our approach extends AV speech in-painting techniques to scenarios where both audio and visual data may be jointly corrupted. To achieve this, we employ a multi-modal training paradigm that boosts the robustness of our model across various conditions involving acoustic and visual distortions. This makes our distortion-aware model a plausible solution for real-world challenging environments. We compare our method with existing transformer-based and recurrent neural network-based models, which attempt to reconstruct missing speech gaps ranging from a few milliseconds to over a second. Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel seq2seq architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer solution by 38.8% in terms of enhancing speech quality and 7.14% in terms of improving speech intelligibility. We exploit a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs lip-reading (transcribing video components to text) while reconstructing missing parts of the associated speech.</description>

      <title>Generative Pre-trained Speech Language Model with Efficient Hierarchical Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity. See \url{https://youngsheen.github.io/GPST/demo} for demo samples.</description>

      <title>Accent Conversion in Text-To-Speech Using Multi-Level VAE and Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid globalization, the need to build inclusive and representative speech technology cannot be overstated. Accent is an important aspect of speech that needs to be taken into consideration while building inclusive speech synthesizers. Inclusive speech technology aims to erase any biases towards specific groups, such as people of certain accent. We note that state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems may currently not be suitable for all people, regardless of their background, as they are designed to generate high-quality voices without focusing on accent. In this paper, we propose a TTS model that utilizes a Multi-Level Variational Autoencoder with adversarial learning to address accented speech synthesis and conversion in TTS, with a vision for more inclusive systems in the future. We evaluate the performance through both objective metrics and subjective listening tests. The results show an improvement in accent conversion ability compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>ControlSpeech: Towards Simultaneous Zero-shot Speaker Cloning and Zero-shot Language Style Control With Decoupled Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ControlSpeech, a text-to-speech (TTS) system capable of fully cloning the speaker's voice and enabling arbitrary control and adjustment of speaking style, merely based on a few seconds of audio prompt and a simple textual style description prompt. Prior zero-shot TTS models and controllable TTS models either could only mimic the speaker's voice without further control and adjustment capabilities or were unrelated to speaker-specific voice generation. Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a more challenging new task-a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and style at the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, and style prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-based parallel decoding to capture corresponding codec representations in a discrete decoupling codec space. Moreover, we discovered the issue of text style controllability in a many-to-many mapping fashion and proposed the Style Mixture Semantic Density (SMSD) model to resolve this problem. SMSD module which is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, is designed to enhance the fine-grained partitioning and sampling capabilities of style semantic information and generate speech with more diverse styles. In terms of experiments, we make available a controllable model toolkit called ControlToolkit with a new style controllable dataset, some replicated baseline models and propose new metrics to evaluate both the control capability and the quality of generated audio in ControlSpeech. The relevant ablation studies validate the necessity of each component in ControlSpeech is necessary. We hope that ControlSpeech can establish the next foundation paradigm of controllable speech synthesis.

      <title>LLark: A Multimodal Instruction-Following Language Model for Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music has a unique and complex structure which is challenging for both expert humans and existing AI systems to understand, and presents unique challenges relative to other forms of audio. We present LLark, an instruction-tuned multimodal model for \emph{music} understanding. We detail our process for dataset creation, which involves augmenting the annotations of diverse open-source music datasets and converting them to a unified instruction-tuning format. We propose a multimodal architecture for LLark, integrating a pretrained generative model for music with a pretrained language model. In evaluations on three types of tasks (music understanding, captioning, reasoning), we show that LLark matches or outperforms existing baselines in music understanding, and that humans show a high degree of agreement with its responses in captioning and reasoning tasks. LLark is trained entirely from open-source music data and models, and we make our training code available along with the release of this paper. Additional results and audio examples are at https://bit.ly/llark, and our source code is available at https://github.com/spotify-research/llark .</description>

      <title>DITTO: Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization for Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization (DITTO), a general-purpose frame-work for controlling pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time via optimizing initial noise latents. Our method can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying model. When we compare our approach against related training, guidance, and optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the door for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models. Sound examples can be found at https://DITTO-Music.github.io/web/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting, exemplified by pioneers like Shazam, has transformed digital audio recognition. However, existing systems struggle with accuracy in challenging conditions, limiting broad applicability. This research proposes an AI and ML integrated audio fingerprinting algorithm to enhance accuracy. Built on the Dejavu Project's foundations, the study emphasizes real-world scenario simulations with diverse background noises and distortions. Signal processing, central to Dejavu's model, includes the Fast Fourier Transform, spectrograms, and peak extraction. The "constellation" concept and fingerprint hashing enable unique song identification. Performance evaluation attests to 100% accuracy within a 5-second audio input, with a system showcasing predictable matching speed for efficiency. Storage analysis highlights the critical space-speed trade-off for practical implementation. This research advances audio fingerprinting's adaptability, addressing challenges in varied environments and applications.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Music Generation with Non-Differentiable Rule Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of symbolic music generation (e.g., generating piano rolls), with a technical focus on non-differentiable rule guidance. Musical rules are often expressed in symbolic form on note characteristics, such as note density or chord progression, many of which are non-differentiable which pose a challenge when using them for guided diffusion. We propose \oursfull (\ours), a novel guidance method that only requires forward evaluation of rule functions that can work with pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play way, thus achieving training-free guidance for non-differentiable rules for the first time. Additionally, we introduce a latent diffusion architecture for symbolic music generation with high time resolution, which can be composed with SCG in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared to standard strong baselines in symbolic music generation, this framework demonstrates marked advancements in music quality and rule-based controllability, outperforming current state-of-the-art generators in a variety of settings.

      <title>RFWave: Multi-band Rectified Flow for Audio Waveform Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly enhanced the reconstruction of audio waveforms from various representations. While diffusion models are adept at this task, they are hindered by latency issues due to their operation at the individual sample point level and the need for numerous sampling steps. In this study, we introduce RFWave, a cutting-edge multi-band Rectified Flow approach designed to reconstruct high-fidelity audio waveforms from Mel-spectrograms or discrete tokens. RFWave uniquely generates complex spectrograms and operates at the frame level, processing all subbands simultaneously to boost efficiency. Leveraging Rectified Flow, which targets a flat transport trajectory, RFWave achieves reconstruction with just 10 sampling steps. Our empirical evaluations show that RFWave not only provides outstanding reconstruction quality but also offers vastly superior computational efficiency, enabling audio generation at speeds up to 97 times faster than real-time on a GPU. An online demonstration is available at: https://rfwave-demo.github.io/rfwave/.</description>

      <title>Voice EHR: Introducing Multimodal Audio Data for Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large AI models trained on audio data may have the potential to rapidly classify patients, enhancing medical decision-making and potentially improving outcomes through early detection. Existing technologies depend on limited datasets using expensive recording equipment in high-income, English-speaking countries. This challenges deployment in resource-constrained, high-volume settings where audio data may have a profound impact. This report introduces a novel data type and a corresponding collection system that captures health data through guided questions using only a mobile/web application. This application ultimately results in an audio electronic health record (voice EHR) which may contain complex biomarkers of health from conventional voice/respiratory features, speech patterns, and language with semantic meaning - compensating for the typical limitations of unimodal clinical datasets. This report introduces a consortium of partners for global work, presents the application used for data collection, and showcases the potential of informative voice EHR to advance the scalability and diversity of audio AI.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Electric Guitar Tones and Effects to Improve Robustness in Guitar Tablature Transcription Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription (GTT) aims at automatically generating symbolic representations from real solo guitar performances. Due to its applications in education and musicology, GTT has gained traction in recent years. However, GTT robustness has been limited due to the small size of available datasets. Researchers have recently used synthetic data that simulates guitar performances using pre-recorded or computer-generated tones and can be automatically generated at large scales. The present study complements these efforts by demonstrating that GTT robustness can be improved by including synthetic training data created using recordings of real guitar tones played with different audio effects. We evaluate our approach on a new evaluation dataset with professional solo guitar performances that we composed and collected, featuring a wide array of tones, chords, and scales.</description>

Abstract: Accent plays a significant role in speech communication, influencing one's capability to understand as well as conveying a person's identity. This paper introduces a novel and efficient framework for accented Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. It has the ability to synthesize a selected speaker's voice, which is converted to any desired target accent. Our thorough experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using both objective and subjective evaluations. The results also show remarkable performance in terms of the ability to manipulate accents in the synthesized speech and provide a promising avenue for future accented TTS research.</description>

      <title>SNIPER Training: Single-Shot Sparse Training for Text-to-Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) models have achieved remarkable naturalness in recent years, yet like most deep neural models, they have more parameters than necessary. Sparse TTS models can improve on dense models via pruning and extra retraining, or converge faster than dense models with some performance loss. Thus, we propose training TTS models using decaying sparsity, i.e. a high initial sparsity to accelerate training first, followed by a progressive rate reduction to obtain better eventual performance. This decremental approach differs from current methods of incrementing sparsity to a desired target, which costs significantly more time than dense training. We call our method SNIPER training: Single-shot Initialization Pruning Evolving-Rate training. Our experiments on FastSpeech2 show that we were able to obtain better losses in the first few training epochs with SNIPER, and that the final SNIPER-trained models outperformed constant-sparsity models and edged out dense models, with negligible difference in training time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Until recently, the field of speaker diarization was dominated by cascaded systems. Due to their limitations, mainly regarding overlapped speech and cumbersome pipelines, end-to-end models have gained great popularity lately. One of the most successful models is end-to-end neural diarization with encoder-decoder based attractors (EEND-EDA). In this work, we replace the EDA module with a Perceiver-based one and show its advantages over EEND-EDA; namely obtaining better performance on the largely studied Callhome dataset, finding the quantity of speakers in a conversation more accurately, and faster inference time. Furthermore, when exhaustively compared with other methods, our model, DiaPer, reaches remarkable performance with a very lightweight design. Besides, we perform comparisons with other works and a cascaded baseline across more than ten public wide-band datasets. Together with this publication, we release the code of DiaPer as well as models trained on public and free data.</description>

      <title>MobileSpeech: A Fast and High-Fidelity Framework for Mobile Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has gained significant attention due to its powerful voice cloning capabilities, requiring only a few seconds of unseen speaker voice prompts. However, all previous work has been developed for cloud-based systems. Taking autoregressive models as an example, although these approaches achieve high-fidelity voice cloning, they fall short in terms of inference speed, model size, and robustness. Therefore, we propose MobileSpeech, which is a fast, lightweight, and robust zero-shot text-to-speech system based on mobile devices for the first time. Specifically: 1) leveraging discrete codec, we design a parallel speech mask decoder module called SMD, which incorporates hierarchical information from the speech codec and weight mechanisms across different codec layers during the generation process. Moreover, to bridge the gap between text and speech, we introduce a high-level probabilistic mask that simulates the progression of information flow from less to more during speech generation. 2) For speaker prompts, we extract fine-grained prompt duration from the prompt speech and incorporate text, prompt speech by cross attention in SMD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileSpeech on multilingual datasets at different levels, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of generating speed and speech quality. MobileSpeech achieves RTF of 0.09 on a single A100 GPU and we have successfully deployed MobileSpeech on mobile devices.

Abstract: Note-level Automatic Singing Voice Transcription (AST) converts singing recordings into note sequences, facilitating the automatic annotation of singing datasets for Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) applications. Current AST methods, however, struggle with accuracy and robustness when used for practical annotation. This paper presents ROSVOT, the first robust AST model that serves SVS, incorporating a multi-scale framework that effectively captures coarse-grained note information and ensures fine-grained frame-level segmentation, coupled with an attention-based pitch decoder for reliable pitch prediction. We also established a comprehensive annotation-and-training pipeline for SVS to test the model in real-world settings. Experimental findings reveal that ROSVOT achieves state-of-the-art transcription accuracy with either clean or noisy inputs. Moreover, when trained on enlarged, automatically annotated datasets, the SVS model outperforms its baseline, affirming the capability for practical application.

Abstract: Reading fluency assessment is a critical component of literacy programmes, serving to guide and monitor early education interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of the exercise when conducted by teachers, the development of automatic tools that can operate on audio recordings of oral reading is attractive as an objective and highly scalable solution. Multiple complex aspects such as accuracy, rate and expressiveness underlie human judgements of reading fluency. In this work, we investigate end-to-end modeling on a training dataset of children's audio recordings of story texts labeled by human experts. The pre-trained wav2vec2.0 model is adopted due its potential to alleviate the challenges from the limited amount of labeled data. We report the performance of a number of system variations on the relevant measures, and also probe the learned embeddings for lexical and acoustic-prosodic features known to be important to the perception of reading fluency.</description>
