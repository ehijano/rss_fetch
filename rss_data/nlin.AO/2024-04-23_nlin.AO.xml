      <title>Travelling waves in an ensemble of excitable oscillators: the interplay of memristive coupling and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using methods of numerical simulation, we demonstrate the constructive role of memristive coupling in the context of the travelling waves formation and robustness in an ensemble of excitable oscillators described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model. First, the revealed aspects of the memristive coupling action are shown on an example of the deterministic model where the memristive properties of the coupling elements provide for achieving travelling waves at lower coupling strength as compared to non-adaptive diffusive coupling. In the presence of noise, the positive role of memristive coupling is manifested as significant increasing a noise intensity critical value corresponding to the noise-induced destruction of travelling waves as compared to classical diffusive interaction. In addition, we point out the second constructive factor, the L{\'e}vy noise whose properties provide for inducing travelling waves.</description>

      <title>The benefits and costs of agglomeration: insights from economics and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many benefits and costs that come from people and firms clustering together in space. Agglomeration economies, in particular, are the manifestation of centripetal forces that make larger cities disproportionately more wealthy than smaller cities, pulling together individuals and firms in close physical proximity. Measuring agglomeration economies, however, is not easy, and the identification of its causes is still debated. Such association of productivity with size can arise from interactions that are facilitated by cities ("positive externalities"), but also from more productive individuals moving in and sorting into large cities ("self-sorting"). Under certain circumstances, even pure randomness can generate increasing returns to scale. In this chapter, we discuss some of the empirical observations, models, measurement challenges, and open question associated with the phenomenon of agglomeration economies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of urban complexity theory, and in particular urban scaling, for the literature in agglomeration economies.</description>

      <title>L\'evy noise-induced coherence resonance: numerical study versus experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo system in the excitable regime, we investigate the influence of the L{\'e}vy noise properties on the effect of coherence resonance. In particular, we demonstrate that the L{\'e}vy noise can be a constructive or destructive factor providing for enhancement or suppression of noise-induced coherence. We show that the positive or negative role of the L{\'e}vy noise impact is dictated by the noise stability index and skewness parameter. The correlation time and the deviation of interspike intervals used in this analysis are shown to be maximized or minimized for an appropriate choice of the noise parameters. Numerical simulations are combined with experiments on an electronic circuit showing an excellent qualitative correspondence and proving thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Learning spatio-temporal patterns with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a powerful combination of machine learning and mechanistic modelling. We train NCA to learn complex dynamics from time series of images and PDE trajectories. Our method is designed to identify underlying local rules that govern large scale dynamic emergent behaviours. Previous work on NCA focuses on learning rules that give stationary emergent structures. We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability. Being able to learn arbitrary dynamics gives NCA great potential as a data driven modelling framework, especially for modelling biological pattern formation.</description>
