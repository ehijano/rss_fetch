      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous field induced harmonic radiation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By theoretical derivation, we constructed an inhomogeneous coefficient equation to correctly describing harmonic radiation in solids induced by a spatially inhomogeneous field, where the widely used semiconductor Bloch equation fails. This equation has superiority over the semiconductor Bloch equation with good applicability to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields. Using graphene as an example, it is found that under inhomogeneous field driving, even-order harmonics occur with an enhancing tendency as the field inhomogeneity increases. As for the second-order harmonic, its intensity dependence is consistent with the prediction from the perturbation theory, and its wavelength dependence can use to directly distinguish the relative contribution of intraband and interband transitions. The inhomogeneous coefficient equation provides a direct theoretical analysis tool for elucidating the physical mechanism of inhomogeneous field induced harmonic radiation in solids.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Scandium Aluminum Nitride/Silicon Nitride Integrated Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scandium-doped aluminum nitride has recently emerged as a promising material for quantum photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its unique combination of strong second-order nonlinearity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. However, the relatively high optical loss reported to date-typically above 2.4 dB/cm-remains a key challenge that limits its widespread application in low-loss PICs. Here, we present a monolithically integrated $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$-ScAlN waveguide platform that overcomes this limitation. By confining light within an etched $\mathrm{Si}_3\mathrm{N}_4$ waveguide while preserving the functional properties of the underlying ScAlN layer, we achieve an intrinsic quality factor of $Q_{\mathrm{i}} = 3.35 \times 10^5$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 1.03 dB/cm-comparable to that of commercial single-mode silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. This hybrid architecture enables low-loss and scalable fabrication while retaining the advanced functionalities offered by ScAlN, such as ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Our results establish a new pathway for ScAlN-based PICs with potential applications in high-speed optical communication, modulation, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum optics within CMOS-compatible platforms.</description>

      <title>Self-cooling, blue-detuned dissipative Kerr microresonator soliton comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) generated in high-Q microresonators driven by continuous-wave (CW) lasers provide chip-scale optical frequency combs composed of mutually coherent CW lines. However, their small mode volume makes them highly susceptible to thermal fluctuations, and the resulting thermo-refractive noise (TRN) perturbs the repetition rate $f_{\rm rep}$. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a blue-detuned DKS in a coupled-ring microresonator. By employing avoided-mode-crossing (AMX)-induced dispersion engineering at the pump mode, DKSs are generated even when the pump laser is tuned to the higher-frequency (blue) side of the resonance. In this regime, the pump laser not only seeds DKS formation but also serves as a cooling laser for the thermally sensitive pumped mode. We observe a self-cooling effect that reduces the phase noise of $f_{\rm rep}$ by up to 14.5 dB, while achieving a pump-to-comb conversion efficiency as high as 37 %. These results establish blue-detuned DKSs as a thermally robust and power-efficient solution for integrated microcomb systems, eliminating the need for auxiliary lasers.</description>

      <title>High-NA In-Line Projector for EUV Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple, four-mirror, in-line projector for high-NA EUV lithography that eliminates the most troublesome mask 3D effect. The design consists of a two-stage concave-convex pair, where optical aberrations are cancelled within each stage and between them, in a manner similar to that of a double-Gauss lens. The light rays pass through the central aperture in each mirror with acceptable obscuration. The numerical aperture (NA) is 0.5 and 0.7 for Hyper-NA. It has a circular exposure field with a diameter of 26 mm. The residual radial distortion is rather high at a few microns at the field rim, and the scan motion causes image blurring. Thus, we need to revert to the stepper design, and the field becomes smaller, i.e. 18 mm x 18 mm square. However, this brings an important benefit: we can remove the scanning mechanism from the photomask side. It is important to note that both the wafer and the photomask remain stationary during the EUV exposure. This guarantees superior overlay control and results in enhanced productivity. This approach serves to simplify the system and reduce electrical consumption also. Illumination will be provided through two rectangular scan-mirrors located in front of the mask, providing dual line scan field, which matches with off-axis illumination enhancing the resolution and bypasses the central obscurations.</description>

      <title>Pseudomagnetic Control of Light Waves in the Electrically Tunable Photonic Crystals with Deformation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the demonstrations of pseudo-magnetism in optical systems, the pursuits of its practical applications require not only the use of pseudomagnetic fields to create functional optical devices but also a reliable method to manipulate pseudo-magnetism-affected light waves. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an ultracompact Si-based cavity formed by triaxially deformed photonic honeycomb lattices. The triaxial deformation could lead to Landau quantization, showing the possibilities of realizing the localization and resonating of photons with pseudomagnetic fields. Through adopting the Si waveguides for directional coupling, we successfully obtain the transmission spectra for the proposed cavities in the photonic integrated circuits. This opens a novel avenue for highly efficient excitations and detections of Landau-quantized photonic density of states, totally on chip. Moreover, we verify a linear electrical tunability of -0.018 THz/mW for the pseudo-magnetism-induced optical resonant states, fulfilling the manipulation of photons without varying deformations. Our work introduces a mechanism for performing tunable light waves in triaxial deformation-engineered systems, which enriches the design principles of integrated optical devices.</description>

      <title>Photon-mediated interactions and dynamics of coherently driven quantum emitters in complex photonic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Born-Markov master equations based on tracing out the electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been extensively employed in the description of quantum optical phenomena originating from photon-mediated interactions in quantum emitter ensembles. The breakdown of these effective models, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an unstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has also recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the accuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and extensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we consider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum emitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a metallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric microresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits a complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring photon-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this modeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact calculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an illustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and dispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of laser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of accuracy in the effective model.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Probing of Materials Plasmonic Properties using Fabry-Perot Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate in situ characterization of plasmonic materials dispersion and efficiency remains a key challenge for next generation nanophotonic devices. To this end, we introduce a platform leveraging extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through plasmonic gratings comprised of subwavelength Fabry Perot (FP) resonators to interrogate the optical response of plasmonic materials. We implement direct E k dispersion mapping across a well defined set of optical momenta by systematically varying the grating size, with each grating serving as a discrete momentum-space probe. Non Hermitian modal decomposition is carried out by means of the finite element method (FEM) and validated with finite difference time domain (FDTD) to examine the eigenstates of the plasmonic systems and analyze the modal hybridization within the aperture. The interplay between the resonant mechanisms involved in the enhanced transmitted field is investigated in both an idealized perfect electric conducting metal and a realistic dispersive metal, emphasizing the aperture s role in mode confinement and resonance shift. This approach provides an angle insensitive platform for reliable, in situ and real time characterization of established and emerging plasmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Gigavoxel-Scale Multiple-Scattering-Aware Lensless Holotomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holotomography (HT) has revolutionized quantitative label-free 3D imaging, yet conventional lens-based implementations are fundamentally constrained in field-of-view (FOV) and imaging depth, limiting their utility for critical high-throughput applications in material and life sciences. Lensless HT (LHT) offers a promising alternative for large-volume examination, however existing approaches fail to accurately reconstruct highly scattering samples over extended depths, which remains a critical challenge in optical imaging field. Here, we introduce a gigavoxel-scale, multiple-scattering-aware LHT with a large FOV (surpassing 0.6 cm2), millimeter-scale axial range and pixel level (~2.4 micron) resolution. Our approach leverages a multi-wavelength, oblique-illumination hologram reconstruction and a robust, automatic illumination angle calibration, which are necessary for precise large-volume 3D holographic reconstruction. Moreover, we propose optimization-driven multi-slice tomographic framework to accurately capture multiple-scattering effects outperforming first order Born/Rytov-based inversions. To rigorously validate our method, we reconstruct bespoke multi-layer two-photon polymerized test structure over a 1.7 mm imaging depth and 25 mm2 FOV, yielding an unprecedented 3D space-bandwidth product exceeding a gigavoxel level. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time on-chip label-free imaging of entire 500-micron-thick tissue slice of optically-cleared mouse brain. With the proposed method, we aim to unlock powerful new capabilities for large-scale, quantitative, label-free 3D imaging across biomedicine, neuroscience, material sciences and beyond.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Floquet Chern and anomalous topological insulators based on Bloch oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is challenging to distinguish Floquet Chern insulator (FCI) and Floquet anomalous topological insulator (FATI) because of their common features of chiral edge states and far away from equilibrium. A hybrid straight-curved waveguide array is proposed to enable topological phase transitions from FCI to FATI and show how to diagnose the two phases using Bloch oscillations. As a proof of principle, the hybrid straight-curved waveguide array is designed as a straight honeycomb waveguide array nested in an asynchronous curved Kagome waveguide array. Under a two-dimensional (2D) tilted potential created by the spatial gradient of refractive indices, an initial Gaussian-like wavepacket undergoes 2D Bloch oscillations, displaying quasi-quantized displacement in the FCI and no drift in the FATI. This approach offers a direct and unambiguous method to diagnose Floquet topological phases from the bulk response.</description>

      <title>Unveiling unique ultrafast nonlinearities in liquid-phase high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) provides a powerful optical tool for probing ultrafast dynamics on the attosecond timescale. While its mechanisms in gases and solids are well-established, understanding nonlinear optical responses in liquids remains challenging. The absence of long-range order in liquids questions the applicability of the existing HHG models developed in other media. Through combined experimental and theoretical investigations, we identify unique characters of liquid-phase HHG -- spectral redshift and broadening, which are fundamentally distinct from both the gaseous and solid-state counterparts. Quantitative measurements and simulations of HHG in liquids illustrate a near linear dependence of harmonic redshift and broadening on the laser intensity, with the nonlinear response of water exceeding that of ethanol. The simulations reveal that these features arise from delocalized electronic states with energy loss in multiple scatterings and transient Stark shift during their transitions in laser fields. Meanwhile, we find that liquid polarity or hydrogen bond exerts decisive control over the transition dipole momentum distributions of delocalized states. Our findings establish a nonlinear spectral method for probing the internal network in liquids, paving the way for studying its role in chemical and biological processes.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Metasurfaces with Structural Chirality and Pseudo-Chirality for Enhanced Circular Dichroism and Enantiomeric Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and optical characterization of a plasmonic metasurface engineered to exhibit strong polarization anisotropy under both linearly and circularly polarized light. The metasurface consists of geometrically asymmetric gold nanostructures arranged periodically on a glass substrate. Each nanostructure is formed by the fusion of three equilateral triangles. The nanostructures simultaneously break mirror and inversion symmetries, resulting in chiral and pseudo-chiral optical responses that manifest as linear and circular polarization-dependent spectral features. Our numerical and experimental results reveal clear chiroptical effects in both near- and far-field. Near-field scanning optical microscopy confirms the excitation of polarization-selective localized plasmonic modes, with spatially distinct hot-spots lighting up under different incident polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metasurface exhibits a measurable enantiospecific optical response when coated with thin left- or right-handed chiral overlayers. The differential circular dichroism signals observed in the presence of opposite enantiomers highlight the potential of the metasurface for label-free chiral sensing. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between structural anisotropy, pseudo-chirality, and enantioselective interactions in planar plasmonic systems. Our findings highlight the ability of planar metasurfaces to emulate chiral optical behavior without requiring volumetric 3D structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum enhanced sensing exploits the coherent dynamics of two-level systems (TLSs) to achieve exceptional sensitivities and measurement precision that surpass classical detection limits. While platforms such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond and rare earth doped crystals have shown excellent performance, their integration with surfaces and external targets remains limited by bulk geometries. Two dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), offer a compelling alternative, providing atomically thin hosts for spin defects with intrinsic surface proximity and environmental accessibility. These attributes enable high resolution sensing of magnetic fields, strain, and temperature at the nanoscale. In this Perspective, we review recent progress in quantum sensing using spin defects in hBN, including the widely studied boron vacancy (VB-) and emerging carbon related single spin centers. We summarize protocols for spin initialization, coherent manipulation, and optical readout, and highlight demonstrated applications in hybrid architectures and extreme environments and discuss advances in deterministic defect engineering, coherence preservation at the 2D limit. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in realizing scalable, robust, and multifunctional quantum sensors based on 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A Kerr soliton Ising machine for combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing challenges of scaling digital computing motivate new approaches, especially through the dynamical evolution of physical systems that mimic neural networks and combinatorial optimization problems. While light is a hyper efficient information carrier, intrinsically weak light interactions make direct information processing difficult to implement. Recently, specialized nonlinear photonics have opened new controls over light fields with extraordinary bandwidth, coherence, and the emergence of strong interactions among nonlinear eigenstates like solitons. We harness an ensemble of hundreds of Kerr-nonlinear microresonator solitons and implement an analog feedback network to create an Ising machine with fully programmable all-to-all interactions. By increasing the feedback for self, on-diagonal interactions, each soliton exhibits a universal spin-like bifurcation. Using this palette of interactions amongst the entire soliton ensemble, we encode the Ising machine to solve the benchmark Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The combination of uniform soliton interactions and the compatibility of our Ising machine with high-speed data interconnects enables rapid and precise solutions of complex SAT problems. Indeed, the soliton properties bound the tradeoff of optical power and time use by the machine at approximately 10 mW and 1 $\mu$s for a single feedback step. We performed &gt;10,000 trials on more than 100 randomly generated SAT instances to evaluate the Ising machine, demonstrating the potential to exceed the performance of benchmark digital SAT solvers. Our work highlights the convergence of optical nonlinearity, ultralow loss photonics, and optoelectronic circuits, which can be combined for a wide range of computation-acceleration tasks.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation reflecting the sub-cycle evolution of the Mott transition under a mid-infrared electric field</title>

Abstract: Solids in an intense laser field show high-harmonic generation (HHG), which can provide information on carrier dynamics and band structures in weakly correlated systems. In strongly correlated systems, a laser field can induce a transition between the various electronic phases formed by the entanglement of charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom via carrier generation. The HHG accompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium electronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains unresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse induces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate, Sr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs. When the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently generated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR frequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate from a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field cycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the radiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle. This phenomenon is negligible in rigid-band systems. This experimental-theoretical study confirms that HH spectroscopy research can potentially unravel the sub-cycle dynamics of nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable, phase-locked hard X-ray pulse sequences generated by a free-electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to arbitrarily dial in amplitudes and phases enables the fundamental quantum state operations pioneered for microwaves and then infrared and visible wavelengths during the second half of the last century. Self-seeded X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) routinely generate coherent, high-brightness, and ultrafast pulses for a wide range of experiments, but have so far not achieved a comparable level of amplitude and phase control. Here we report the first tunable phase-locked, ultra-fast hard X-ray (PHLUX) pulses by implementing a recently proposed method: A fresh-bunch self-seeded FEL, driven by an electron beam that was shaped with a slotted foil and a corrugated wakefield structure, generates coherent radiation that is intensity-modulated on the femtosecond time scale. We measure phase-locked (to within a shot-to-shot phase jitter corresponding to 0.1 attoseconds) pulse triplets with a photon energy of 9.7 keV, a pulse energy of several tens of microjoules, a freely tunable relative phase, and a pulse delay tunability between 4.5 and 11.9 fs. Such pulse sequences are suitable for a wide range of applications, including coherent spectroscopy, and have amplitudes sufficient to enable hard X-ray quantum optics experiments. More generally, these results represent an important step towards a hard X-ray arbitrary waveform generator.</description>

      <title>There is no ultrastrong coupling with photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included. We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing systems provide an alternate hardware model which appears to be aligned with the demands of neural network workloads. However, the challenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key requirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability to drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spatial Filtering with Nonlocal Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial filtering of optical fields has widespread applications ranging from beam shaping to optical information processing. However, conventional spatial filters are bulky and alignment-sensitive. Here, we present nonlocal non-Hermitian metasurfaces that can act as exceptionally effective optical spatial filters while being highly compact and insensitive to both lateral and longitudinal displacements. The metasurface design is based on a resonant waveguide grating in which radiative losses of the modes are tailored to realize a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum in the middle of a non-Hermitian flat band. Using this design, we propose a compact spatial filtering device operating over an angular range of approximately 1 degree around normal incidence. In addition to being ultrathin and robust against translational misalignment, the proposed metasurfaces are easy to manufacture, which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional spatial filters, holding a potential to become a widely used optical component.</description>

Abstract: Topological photonics was embarked from realizing the first-order chiral edge state in gyromagnetic media, but its higher-order states were mostly studied in dielectric lattice instead. In this paper in a series of gyromagnetic Lieb photonic crystals, we theoretically unveil topological phases which include the first-order Chern, and the second-order dipole, quadrupole phases. Concretely, for the primitive Lieb lattice, and for its deformation by breaking spatial symmetry through unit-cell deformation, versatile topological phases can be established to transit around, with bandgap closures marking the phase boundaries. Our results on gyromagnetic Lieb photonic crystals may contribute to broadening the scope of sublattice engineering design for topological phase manipulation, potentially enabling multifunctional disorder-resistant waveguides and integrated photonic circuits for information communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the design concept of negative curvature hollow-core fibers, this paper presents an innovative negative curvature suspended-core THz fiber. Compared to traditional suspended-core fibers, all structural units of this fiber are designed with circular boundaries, effectively avoiding the issues of insufficient mechanical strength and manufacturing difficulties associated with the wide and thin rectangular support arms in traditional structures. The numerical simulation using the full-vector finite element method shows that the optical fiber loss is as low as 0.02cm-1 in 0.66-1.09THz, and the low loss bandwidth is 0.43THz. In addition, near-zero flat dispersion of -0.08-0.74 ps/THz/cm can be achieved. The fiber exhibits excellent characteristics of low loss, wide bandwidth, and low dispersion, theoretically opening a new research path for the design of low-loss THz fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) using intense XUV and soft X-ray pulses holds the promise to deliver information on the three dimensional shape as well as the optical properties of nano-scale objects in a single diffraction image. This advantage over conventional X-ray diffraction methods comes at the cost of a much more complex description of the underlying scattering process due to the importance of wide-angle scattering and propagation effects. The commonly employed reconstruction of the sample properties via iterative forward fitting of diffraction patterns requires an accurate and fast method to simulate the scattering process. This work introduces the propagation multi-slice Fourier transform method (pMSFT) and demonstrates its superior performance and accuracy against existing methods for wide-angle scattering. A derivation from first principles, a unified physical picture of the approximations underlying pMSFT and the existing methods, as well as a systematic benchmark that provides qualified guidance for the selection of the appropriate scattering method is presented.</description>

Abstract: We report the realization of Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) nanowaveguides and the experimental observation of second harmonic generation (SHG) in such structures, demonstrating their potential for integrated nonlinear photonics. ZnS thin films were deposited via RF magnetron sputtering and characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ellipsometry. The nonlinear optical properties of these films were theoretically analyzed to assess their suitability for second-order nonlinear processes. We detail the fabrication and optical characterization of ZnS nanowaveguides, leading to the experimental observation of SHG in such structures. These findings establish ZnS as a promising platform for nonlinear photonic applications, particularly in compact and integrated frequency conversion devices. This work represents a significant step toward expanding the scope of wide bandgap semiconductors in advanced photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons either originate from linear topological edge modes or emerge as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. While electric circuits (ECs) provide a platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observation of edge solitons and transitions between them in EC lattices remains a challenging problem. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear ECs to experimentally demonstrate both topologically nontrivial and trivial edge solitons in a trimer EC lattice and transitions between them. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we observe two types of topologically nontrivial edge solitons that originate from the corresponding linear topological edge states, characterized by the presence of mutually antisymmetric or symmetric peaks at two edge sites. Under strong nonlinearity, topologically trivial edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric internal structures are discovered. The work suggests possibilities for exploring sophisticated nonlinear states and transitions between them in nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Non-Hermitian Topology Associated with Non-Toroidal Brillouin Zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are prominent non-Hermitian band degeneracies that give rise to a variety of intriguing and unconventional phenomena. Similar to Weyl and Dirac points, EPs carry topological charges and comply with the celebrated fermion doubling theorems in lattices. Beyond these characteristics, EPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian braiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate these foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices where the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather than a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily appear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein bottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs because, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of EPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique braiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories. Specifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along the boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle. This novel braiding topology further confirms the failure of the fermion doubling theorem, and allows us to explore the non-Abelian braidings of EPs beyond the scope of topological charges. Our work highlights the fundamental role of Brillouin-zone topology in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunctional Entanglement to Entangled Wavefunctional Degrees of Freedom</title>

Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from quantum foundations to quantum computation. Here, I offer a fresh, deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom. This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally entangled photons within inseparable field modes.</description>
