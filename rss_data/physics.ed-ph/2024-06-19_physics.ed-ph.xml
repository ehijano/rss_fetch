      <title>Exploring Gamification in Quantum Computing: The Qubit Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamification of quantum theory can provide new inroads into the subject: by allowing users to experience simulated worlds that manifest obvious quantum behaviors they can potentially build intuition for quantum phenomena. The Qubit Factory is an engineering-style puzzle game based on a gamified quantum circuit simulator that is designed to provide an introduction to qubits and quantum computing, while being approachable to those with no prior background in the area. It introduces an intuitive visual language for representing quantum states, gates and circuits, further enhanced by animations to aid in visualization. The Qubit Factory presents a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tasks for the user to solve, where each task requires the user to construct and run an appropriate classical/quantum circuit built from a small selection of components. Earlier tasks cover the fundamentals of qubits, quantum gates, superpositions and entanglement. Later tasks cover important quantum algorithms and protocols including superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement distillation, classical and quantum error correction, state tomography, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, quantum repeaters and more.</description>

      <title>Status of Astronomy Education in India: A Baseline Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a nation-wide baseline survey, conducted by us, for the status of Astronomy education among secondary school students in India. The survey was administered in 10 different languages to over 2000 students from diverse backgrounds, and it explored multiple facets of their perspectives on astronomy. The topics included students' views on the incorporation of astronomy in curricula, their grasp of fundamental astronomical concepts, access to educational resources, cultural connections to astronomy, and their levels of interest and aspirations in the subject. We find notable deficiencies in students' knowledge of basic astronomical principles, with only a minority demonstrating proficiency in key areas such as celestial sizes, distances, and lunar phases. Furthermore, access to resources such as telescopes and planetariums remain limited across the country. Despite these challenges, a significant majority of students expressed a keen interest in astronomy. We further analyze the data along socioeconomic and gender lines. Particularly striking were the socioeconomic disparities, with students from resource-poor backgrounds often having lower levels of access and proficiency. Some differences were observed between genders, although not very pronounced. The insights gleaned from this study hold valuable implications for the development of a more robust astronomy curriculum and the design of effective teacher training programs in the future.</description>
