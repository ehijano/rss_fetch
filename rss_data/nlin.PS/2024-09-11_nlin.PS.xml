      <title>Pattern formation of bulk-surface reaction-diffusion systems in a ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly nonlinear amplitude equations are derived for the onset of spatially extended patterns on a general class of $n$-component bulk-surface reaction-diffusion systems in a ball, under the assumption of linear kinetics in the bulk. Linear analysis shows conditions under which various pattern modes can become unstable to either generalised pitchfork or transcritical bifurcations depending on the parity of the spatial wavenumber. Weakly nonlinear analysis is used to derive general expressions for the multi-component amplitude equations of different patterned states. These reduced-order systems are found to agree with prior normal forms for pattern formation bifurcations with $O(3)$ symmetry and provide information on the stability of bifurcating patterns of different symmetry types. The analysis is complemented with numerical results using a dedicated finite-element method. The theory is illustrated in two examples; a bulk-surface version of the Brusselator, and a four-component cell-polarity model.</description>

      <title>Designing reaction-cross-diffusion systems with Turing and wave instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General conditions are established under which reaction-cross-diffusion systems can undergo spatiotemporal pattern-forming instabilities. Recent work has focused on designing systems theoretically and experimentally to exhibit patterns with specific features, but the case of non-diagonal diffusion matrices has yet to be analysed. Here, a framework is presented for the design of general $n$-component reaction-cross-diffusion systems that exhibit Turing and wave instabilities of a given wavelength. For a fixed set of reaction kinetics, it is shown how to choose diffusion matrices that produce each instability; conversely, for a given diffusion tensor, how to choose linearised kinetics. The theory is applied to several examples including a hyperbolic reaction-diffusion system, two different 3-component models, and a spatio-temporal version of the Ross-Macdonald model for the spread of malaria.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach for pure high, even-order dispersion solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically solve the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing the propagation of pure high, even order dispersion (PHEODs) solitons by variational approach. The Lagrangian for nonlinear pulse transmission systems with each dispersion order are given and the analytical solutions of PHEOD soltions are obtained and compared with the numerical results. It is shown that the variational results approximate very well for lower orders of dispersion ($\le 8$) and get worst as the order increasing. In addition, using the linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that all PHEOD solitons are stable and obtain the soliton internal modes that accompany soliton transmission. These results are helpful for the application of PHEOD solitons in high energy lasers.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>
