      <title>Planar chemical reaction systems with algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hilbert number $H(n)$ is defined as the maximum number of limit cycles of a planar autonomous system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with right-hand sides containing polynomials of degree at most $n \in {\mathbb N}$. The dynamics of chemical reaction systems with two chemical species can be (under mass-action kinetics) described by such planar autonomous ODEs, where $n$ is equal to the maximum order of the chemical reactions in the system. Generalizations of the Hilbert number $H(n)$ to three different classes of chemical reaction networks are investigated: (i) chemical systems with reactions up to the $n$-th order; (ii) systems with up to $n$-molecular chemical reactions; and (iii) weakly reversible chemical reaction networks. In each case (i), (ii) and (iii), the question on the number of limit cycles is considered. Lower bounds on the generalized Hilbert numbers are provided for both algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles. Furthermore, given a general algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ of degree $n_h \in {\mathbb N}$ and containing one or more ovals in the positive quadrant, a chemical system is constructed which has the oval(s) as its stable algebraic limit cycle(s). The ODEs describing the dynamics of the constructed chemical system contain polynomials of degree at most $n=2\,n_h+1.$ Considering $n_h \ge 4,$ the algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ can contain multiple closed components with the maximum number of ovals given by Harnack's curve theorem as $1+(n_h-1)(n_h-2)/2$, which is equal to 4 for $n_h=4.$ Algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ with $n_h=4$ and the maximum number of four ovals is used to construct a chemical system which has four stable algebraic limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude against the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>
