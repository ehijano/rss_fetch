      <title>Near-horizon aspects of black holes in quantum spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short introduction to the formalism of noncommutative (twisted) differential geometry that is used to derive the equations of motion for the gravitational perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole in quantized spacetime. Special attention is given to quantum spacetime arising from $r - \varphi$ noncommutativity. Tortoise coordinate and near-horizon regions of the effective potentials are analyzed for both polar and axial modes. By carefully examining the associated Schr\"odinger-type equations, we provide the asymptotic solutions at the horizon and illustrate some differences between the polar and axial modes. These findings give further insight into the polar-axial isospectrality violation in the presence of the quantum structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quark stars in generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of quark stars with two different equations of state in generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. This theory corresponds to a bi-scalar gravitational theory in which two non-minimally-coupled scalar fields. The field equations of the metric tensor and scalar fields are derived by varying the action with respect to the dynamical fields. We obtain the field equations for static spherically symmetric geometry interior of compact objects. The numerical solutions for two types of quark stars, the MIT bag and CFL model are studied. The solutions reveal the structure of the compact objects. The solutions are obtained for different values of the model parameters. All considered cases show that compact objects are more massive than their general relativity counterpart. The surface redshift and compactness are also obtained which shows that the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini quark stars have higher surface redshift and are more compact than general relativity quark stars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by appropriately perturbing the background fluid, gravitational wave-like fluctuations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such fluctuations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>

      <title>Simulating binary black hole mergers using discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes are the most abundant source of gravitational-wave observations. Gravitational-wave observatories in the next decade will require tremendous increases in the accuracy of numerical waveforms modeling binary black holes, compared to today's state of the art. One approach to achieving the required accuracy is using spectral-type methods that scale to many processors. Using the SpECTRE numerical-relativity code, we present the first simulations of a binary black hole inspiral, merger, and ringdown using discontinuous Galerkin methods. The efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin methods allows us to evolve the binary through ~18 orbits at reasonable computational cost. We then use SpECTRE's Cauchy Characteristic Evolution (CCE) code to extract the gravitational waves at future null infinity. The open-source nature of SpECTRE means this is the first time a spectral-type method for simulating binary black hole evolutions is available to the entire numerical-relativity community.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes in the Conservative $f (R, T )$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wormhole construction in the framework of the $f(R,T)$ extended gravity theory, with $R$ being the Ricci curvature scalar and $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, in the case in which the energy-momentum tensor is conserved. From the conservation equation we find that the $f(R,T)$ function is linear in $T$. By developing the field equations, we find a traversable wormhole that for a range of the model parameter values, has no need to be filled by exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Infrared Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature CFT in Rindler Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-temperature behavior of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in Rindler vacuum, focusing on the relation between acceleration and thermality in quantum field theory. We illustrate how uniformly accelerated observers perceive the vacuum as a thermal state via Unruh effect, shedding light on the thermal properties of Rindler horizon. Through numerical simulations of the heat kernel, Unruh temperature, Planck distribution, and detector response, we demonstrate that acceleration enhances the thermal characteristics of quantum fields. These results provide important insights into horizon-induced thermality, with significant implications for black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonsingular black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Completely Deformed Complexity-free Anisotropic Fluid Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the formation of compact, anisotropic stellar configurations by following the scheme of decoupling the gravitational-field sectors within the principles of complete geometric deformation. In pursuit of this aim, we use viable stellar constraints, including density-like constraints and the zero-complexity factor scheme proposed in the context of stellar configurations. We begin with employing an appropriate metric ansatz as the initial metric potential (seed solution). Imposing the zero-complexity factor constraint allows us to fully capture the gravitational behavior of compact stellar distribution featuring anisotropic pressure. Then, the process of completely deforming the gravitational field source leads to the formation of the desired, highly dense stellar configuration. The novelty of our approach is in the implementation of zero-complexity and density-like techniques to derive the deformation functions. By solving the resulting governing equations, we obtain two solutions, which are consistent with the physical viability tests. These tests show that pressure anisotropy within the confined object greatly affects its stability. It is concluded that the direction of energy transfer between the seed-gravitational field region and the unknown generic-field generator is described by the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Defrosting frozen stars: spectrum of non-radial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frozen star model describes a type of black hole mimicker; that is, a regular, horizonless, ultracompact object that behaves just like a Schwarzschild black hole from an external-observer's perspective. In particular, the frozen star is bald, meaning that it cannot be excited. To mimic the possible excitations of the frozen star, it needs to be "defrosted" by allowing deviations from the maximally negative radial pressure and vanishing tangential pressure of the fluid sourcing the star. Here, we extend a previous study on non-radial oscillations of the defrosted star by considering, in addition to the fluid modes, the even-parity metric perturbations and their coupling to the fluid modes. At first, general equations are obtained for the perturbations of the energy density and pressure along with the even-parity perturbations of the metric for a static, spherically symmetric but otherwise generic background with an anisotropic fluid. This formal framework is then applied to the case of a defrosted star. The spectrum of non-radial oscillations is obtained to leading order in an expansion in terms of $\gamma$, which is the small relative deviation away from maximally negative radial pressure. We find that the sound velocity of the modes is non-relativistic, and proportional to $\gamma$, while their lifetime is parametrically long, proportional to $1/\gamma^2$. This result was anticipated by previous discussions on the collapsed polymer model, whose strongly non-classical interior is argued to provide a microscopic description of the frozen and defrosted star geometries. Our results will serve as a starting point for calculating the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves from an excited frozen star.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a charged loop quantum black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field around a charged loop quantum black hole (BH). The BH is characterized by two key parameters: the quantum parameter $b_0$ and the charge parameter $Q$. We explore two scenarios: one where the multipole quantum number $l=0$, in which only the gravitational potential is relevant, and another where $l &gt; 0$, in which both $Q$ and $b_0$ jointly influence the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs). For $l=0$, quantum gravity effects lead to a pronounced overtone outburst in the QNFs, with the outburst and accompanying oscillatory patterns becoming more pronounced as the overtone number increases. For $l &gt; 0$, the overtone outburst disappears due to the centrifugal potential's suppressive the quantum gravity effect. However, a non-monotonic behavior in the first two overtones with respect to $b_0$ is observed, indicating that subtle quantum gravity effects persist. This behavior vanishes as $Q$ increases, further confirming the suppressive influence of the centrifugal potential on the quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Shadows of Black Holes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two $f(R,T)$ gravity models and derive black hole solutions within these models. We focus on investigating how the $f(R,T)$ model influences the thermodynamic characteristics of black holes by studying their thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry. We consider five specific values of the thermodynamic parameter $\omega$, which signify five different classes of black hole solutions in general relativity (GR). We observe significant changes in the local topological properties of these black holes compared to GR, depending on the model parameters. Notably, we identify an additional topological class $W=0$ for some values of $\omega$ that is absent in the GR framework. We also study the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole using the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that the singular point, where the GTD scalar curvature diverges, corresponds exactly to the point where the heat capacity changes sign. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters of both models considered by utilizing black hole shadow data from the Sgr A* black hole, measured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Greybody Factors of Charged Symmergent Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors within the framework of Symmergent gravity, an emergent gravity model with an $R + R^2$ curvature sector. Building on our previous work on static spherically-symmetric solutions [Class.Quant.Grav. 40 (2023) 19, 195003], we explore the effects of the key parameters, including the quadratic curvature coupling parameter $c_{\rm O}$ and the vacuum energy parameter $\alpha$. For both scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, an increase in $\alpha$ leads to a nearly linear rise in both oscillation frequencies and damping rates. The other parameter $c_{\rm O}$ affects the QNMs spectrum nonlinearly. Additionally, the charge $Q$ of the black hole introduces nonlinear behavior, where higher charges amplify the black hole's electromagnetic field, resulting in increased oscillation frequencies and faster stabilization. These findings enhance our understanding of charged black hole stability and gravitational wave astrophysics. Further, the analysis of greybody factors reveals that increasing $\alpha$, $c_{\rm O}$, and $Q$ reduces the absorption of radiation, with electromagnetic perturbations reaching maximum absorption at slightly lower frequencies compared to scalar perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical reconstruction of the $\Lambda$CDM model in the scalar-tensor representation of $f\left(Q,T\right)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in the nonmetricity-matter couplings, we develop the scalar-tensor formulation of recently introduced $f(Q,T)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the nonmetricity and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The main properties of the scalar-tensor formalism for the Friedmann-Lema{\^ i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe are discussed, and we introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to analyze the cosmic evolution of the scalar-tensor $f(Q,T)$ cosmology as a dynamical system. By considering two distinct cosmic fluids, namely matter and radiation, we have demonstrated that the cosmological phase space exhibits the typical curvature-dominated, radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and exponentially accelerated fixed points. Furthermore, under an appropriate set of initial conditions compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite, our analysis shows that the scalar-tensor $f(Q,T)$ successfully yields models indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and compatible with the weak-field solar system dynamics, without the inclusion of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Thus, the theory introduced herein may be regarded as a suitable candidate to describe the cosmological dynamics of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of dyonic black holes in minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of black holes offers a promising avenue for exploring the quantum nature of black holes and quantum gravity. In this Letter, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of dyonic black holes in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, obtained from IIB supergravity. We demonstrate that the standard form of the first law of thermodynamics is inconsistent with the quantum statistical relation widely adopted in black hole physics. By employing the on-shell variation of the Euclidean action and the Iyer-Wald formalism, we resolve this discrepancy and derive both the standard form of the first law and Smarr formula for the dyonic black holes. Furthermore, our findings are corroborated by numerical tests and are consistent with general hydrodynamic expectations.</description>

      <title>Geometrical deformation of brane matter field within $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the curvature scalar, while $Q=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ and $P=R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin $1/2$ fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.</description>

      <title>Factorization of the Hilbert space of eternal black holes in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize recent results in two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity to study factorization of the Hilbert space of eternal black holes in quantum gravity with a negative cosmological constant in any dimension. We approach the problem by computing the trace of two-sided observables as a sum over a recently constructed family of semiclassically well-controlled black hole microstates. These microstates, which contain heavy matter shells behind the horizon and form an overcomplete basis of the Hilbert space, exist in any theory of gravity with general relativity as its low energy limit. Using this representation of the microstates, we show that the trace of operators dual to functions of the Hamiltonians of the left and right holographic CFTs factorizes into a product over left and right factors to leading order in the semiclassical limit. Under certain conditions this implies factorization of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Back to the origins of brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new framework for brane-antibrane inflation where moduli stabilisation relies purely on perturbative corrections to the effective action. This guarantees that the model does not suffer from the eta-problem. The inflationary potential has two contributions: the tension of an antibrane at the tip of a warped throat, and its Coulomb interaction with a mobile brane. This represents the first realisation of the original idea of brane-antibrane inflation, as opposed to inflection point inflation which arises when the moduli are fixed with non-perturbative effects. Moreover, we formulate the brane-antibrane dynamics as an F-term potential of a nilpotent superfield in a manifestly supersymmetric effective theory. We impose compatibility with data and consistency conditions on control over the approximations and find that slow-roll inflation can occur in a large region of the underlying parameter space. The scalar spectral index is in agreement with data and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is beyond current observational reach. Interestingly, after the end of inflation the volume mode can, but does not need to, evolve towards a late-time minimum at larger values.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of the Electroweak Scale with Dyson-Schwinger: Fermionic Mass Gap and Higher-order Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interaction of a fermion field $\psi$ with a scalar field $\phi$ and analyze the spectrum of the theory obtained in this way. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden fermion sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the fermion sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of fermion mass and the $\phi$ self-quartic. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated .</description>

      <title>Accessing universal relations of binary neutron star waveforms in massive scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the quasi-universal relations connecting tidal deformability with gravitational waveform characteristics and/or properties of individual neutron stars that were proposed in the literature within general relativity would be influenced in the massive Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor gravity. For this purpose, we systematically perform numerical relativity simulations of ~120 binary neutron star mergers with varying scalar coupling constants. Although only three neutron-star equations of state are adopted, a clear breach of universality can be observed in the data sets. In addition to presenting difficulties in constructing quasi-universal relations in alternative gravity theories, we also briefly compare the impacts of non-general-relativity physics on the waveform features and those due to the first order or cross-over quantum chromodynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theory called Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has significant implications for Cosmology. We derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein-Gordon equation using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss-Bonnet term, and logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss-Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive black hole shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.491$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in Cosmology.</description>

      <title>General constraints on Tsallis holographic dark energy from observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated Tsallis holographic dark energy (THDE) model in light of modern observations of supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements, data for baryon acoustic oscillations and fluctuations of matter density. The dark energy density for THDE model is written as $\rho_d = 3C^2 / L^{4-2\gamma}$ where $C$ and $\gamma$ are some constants. Scale $L$ is infrared cut-off lenght for which we use the event horizon. For analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) data Pantheon+ samples are involved. Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements serves as source of data about ratios between sound horizon $r_d$ and Hubble ($d_H$) or volume averaged ($d_V$) distances. The updated dataset of Hubble parameter for various redshift is also used in our analysis. Finally we considered the dependence of matter density fluctuations in past from redshift. The standard stratefy of $\chi^2$ minimizing allows to estimate the optimal values of parameters ($\Omega_{de}$ and $H_0$) for some fixed values of $C$ and $\gamma$. One note that best-fit values for parameters $H_0$ from Hubble parameter and SNeIa data are more close than in standard $\Lambda$CDM model for some $C$ and $\gamma$ although problem of Hubble tension remains unsolved. The combined data analysis also gives slightly better results in comparison with standard cosmology. We included in our consideration the possible interaction between matter and holographic component and estimated the acceptable interval of model parameters in this case.</description>

      <title>Viability of loop quantum cosmology at the level of bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations by Planck indicate that CMB anisotropies are consistent with predictions of nearly Gaussian primordial perturbations as the one generated in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, loop quantum cosmology (LQC) generates a non-Gaussian bispectrum. In particular, calculations of primordial bispectrum generated in LQC shows that the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,\, k_2,\, k_3)$ is highly scale-dependent and oscillatory at long wavelengths and is nearly scale-invariant as in slow-roll at small scales. We discuss the viability of such a non-Gaussian bispectrum in the light of observations by Planck. More specifically, we model the bispectrum generated in LQC and compute its imprints on the CMB bispectrum. We then show that the CMB bispectrum generated in LQC though non-Gaussian, due to its highly oscillatory nature, is similar to that generated in slow-roll inflation and hence consistent with the observations by Planck.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ towards the quasar PHL957</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting or placing upper limits on spacetime variations of fundamental constants requires quantifying every potential source of uncertainty. We continue our previous study into the impact of continuum variations on measurements of the fine structure constant, here in the context of quasar absorption systems. An automated (hence objective and reproducible) continuum modelling method is reported in an accompanying paper. We apply the method to the $z_{abs}=1.7975$ absorption system towards the quasar PHL957. Multiple continuum fits are generated, and for each, we derive independent models of the system, each giving its own measurement of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. This process isolates and quantifies the error contribution associated with continuum placement uncertainty. This source of uncertainty, ignored in many previous measurements, arises in two ways: (i) slight local continuum tilt uncertainty generates small line shifts, and (ii) different continuum estimates produce slightly different kinematic structures in the absorption system model. Taking continuum placement uncertainty into account, the new PHL957 measurement we obtain is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha= -0.53^{+5.45}_{-5.51} \times 10^{-6}$. This measurement assumes terrestrial magnesium isotopic abundances. Recommendations are provided for future $\alpha$ measurements. Finally, we also note the potential importance of the effects identified here for future redshift drift experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High relative velocities and large distances in space-based quantum communication with satellites in lower earth orbits can lead to significant Doppler shifts and delays of the signal impairing the achievable performance if uncorrected. We analyze the influence of systematic and stochastic Doppler shift and delay in the specific case of a continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol and identify the generalized correlation function, the ambiguity function, as a decisive measure of performance loss. Investigating the generalized correlations as well as private capacity bounds for specific choices of spectral amplitude shape (Gaussian, single- and double-sided Lorentzian), we find that this choice has a significant impact on the robustness of the quantum communication protocol to spectral and temporal synchronization errors. We conclude that optimizing the pulse shape can be a building block in the resilient design of quantum network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Maxwell field with gauge fixing term in the radiation- and matter-dominant stages: exact solution and stress tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Maxwell field with a general gauge fixing (GF) term in the radiation-dominant (RD) and matter-dominant (MD) stages of expanding Universe, as a continuation to the previous work in de Sitter space. We derive the exact solutions, perform the covariant canonical quantization and obtain the stress tensor in the Gupta-Bleuler (GB) physical states, which is independent of the GF constant and is also invariant under the quantum residual gauge transformation. The transverse stress tensor is similar in all flat Robertson-Walker spacetimes, and its vacuum part is $\propto k^4$ and becomes zero after the 0th-order adiabatic regularization. The longitudinal-temporal stress tensor, in both RD and MD stages, is zero due to a cancelation between the longitudinal and temporal parts in the GB states, and so is the particle part of the GF stress tensor. The vacuum GF stress tensor, in the RD stage, contains $k^4,k^2$ divergences and becomes zero by the 2nd-order regularization, however, in the MD stage, contains $k^4, k^2, k^0$ divergences and becomes zero by the 4th-order regularization. So, the order of adequate regularization depends not only upon the type of fields, but also upon the background spacetimes. In summary, in both the RD and MD stages, like in de Sitter space, the total regularized vacuum stress tensor is zero, only the transverse photon part remains, and this holds independent of the GF term.</description>

      <title>A lower semicontinuous time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time separation function (or Lorentzian distance function) is a fundamental object used in Lorentzian geometry. For smooth spacetimes it is known to be lower semicontinuous, and in fact, continuous for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Moreover, an axiom for Lorentzian length spaces - a synthetic approach to Lorentzian geometry - is the existence of a lower semicontinuous time separation function. Nevertheless, the usual time separation function is $\textit{not}$ necessarily lower semicontinuous for $C^0$ spacetimes due to bubbling phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a class of curves called "nearly timelike" and show that the time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes is lower semicontinuous when defined with respect to nearly timelike curves. Moreover, this time separation function agrees with the usual one when the metric is smooth. Lastly, sufficient conditions are found guaranteeing the existence of a nearly timelike maximizer between two points in a $C^0$ spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent astronomical milestone by the pulsar timing arrays (PTA) has revealed galactic-size gravitational waves (GW) in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), correlating the radio pulses emitted by millisecond pulsars. This draws the outstanding questions toward the origin and the nature of the SGWB; the latter is synonymous to testing how quadrupolar the inter-pulsar spatial correlation is. In this paper, we tackle the nature of the SGWB by considering correlations beyond the Hellings-Downs (HD) curve of Einstein's general relativity. We put the HD and non-Einsteinian GW correlations under scrutiny with the NANOGrav and the CPTA data, and find that both data sets allow a graviton mass $m_{\rm g} \lesssim 1.04 \times 10^{-22} \ {\rm eV}/c^2$ and subluminal traveling waves. We discuss gravitational physics scenarios beyond general relativity that could host non-Einsteinian GW correlations in the SGWB and highlight the importance of the cosmic variance inherited from the stochasticity in interpreting PTA observation.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle structure in Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to provide a rigorous geometric framework for the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity. As the starting point of this formulation consists in recasting General Relativity as an SU(2) gauge theory, it naturally lends itself to interpretation within the theory of principal bundles. The foundation of our framework is the spin structure, which connects the principal SU(2)-bundle construction with the Riemannian framework. The existence of the spin structure enlightens the geometric properties of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection and the topological characteristics of the manifold. Within this framework, we are able to express the constraints of the physical theory in a coordinate-free way, using vector-valued forms that acquire a clear geometric interpretation.
  Using these geometric concepts, we analyze the phase space of the theory and discuss the implementation of symmetries through the automorphism group of the principal SU(2)-bundle. In particular, we demonstrate that the description of the kinematical constraints as vector-valued forms provides a natural implementation as momentum maps for the automorphism group action.</description>

      <title>Fast and faithful interpolation of numerical relativity surrogate waveforms using meshfree approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several theoretical waveform models have been developed over the years to capture the gravitational wave emission from the dynamical evolution of compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes. As ground-based detectors improve their sensitivity at low frequencies, the real-time computation of these waveforms can become computationally expensive, exacerbating the steep cost of rapidly reconstructing source parameters using Bayesian methods. This paper describes an efficient numerical algorithm for generating high-fidelity interpolated compact binary waveforms at an arbitrary point in the signal manifold by leveraging computational linear algebra techniques such as singular value decomposition and meshfree approximation. The results are presented for the time-domain \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model that is fine tuned to numerical relativity simulations and parameterized by the two component-masses and two aligned spins. For demonstration, we target a specific region of the intrinsic parameter space inspired by the previously inferred parameters of the \texttt{GW200311\_115853} event -- a binary black hole system whose merger was recorded by the network of advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors during the third observation run. We show that the meshfree interpolated waveforms can be evaluated in $\sim 2.3$ ms, which is about $\times 38$ faster than its brute-force (frequency-domain tapered) implementation in the \textsc{PyCBC} software package at a median accuracy of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales favourably with an increasing number of dimensions of the parameter space. This technique may find use in rapid parameter estimation and source reconstruction studies.</description>

      <title>The Common Solution Space of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the solution space for the field equations of Einstein's General Relativity for various static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We consider the vacuum case, represented by the Schwarzschild black hole; the de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry, which includes a cosmological constant; the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry, which accounts for the presence of charge. Additionally we consider the homogenenous and anisotropic locally rotational Bianchi II spacetime in the vacuum. Our analysis reveals that the field equations for these scenarios share a common three-dimensional group of point transformations, with the generators being the elements of the $D\otimes_{s}T_{2}$ Lie algebra, known as the semidirect product of dilations and translations in the plane. Due to this algebraic property the field equations for the aforementioned gravitational models can be expressed in the equivalent form of the null geodesic equations for conformally flat geometries. Consequently, the solution space for the field equations is common, and it is the solution space for the free particle in a flat space. This appoach open new directions on the construction of analytic solutions in gravitational physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>Arm-Locking Frequency Noise Suppression for Astronomical Middle-Frequency Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For space gravitational wave (GW) detection, arm locking is a proposal useful in decreasing the frequency noise of the laser sources for current developing space missions LISA and Taiji/TianQin. In this paper, we study the application of arm locking to the Astrodynamical Middle-frequency Interferometric Gravitational wave Observatory (AMIGO) to decrease the frequency noise of laser sources. For AMIGO, the arm-locking technique can suppress the laser frequency noise by three orders of magnitude. The advantage of this is to make the auxiliary noise assignment for AMIGO easier and more relaxed. For the first-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration, the laser frequency noise contribution is already below the core noise contribution. For the simple Michelson TDI configuration (X0), the arm locking makes the acceleration-thrust scheme, the delay-line scheme, or the combined scheme easier to implement. Within a relatively short period of less than a day (compared to less than twenty days for LISA/Taiji), the Doppler frequency pulling can be efficiently reduced to within $\pm$ 0.001 Hz and does not affect the mission duty cycle much.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars: Oscillations and precessions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <title>Residual eccentricity as a systematic uncertainty on the formation channels of binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolving the formation channel(s) of merging binary black holes is a key goal in gravitational-wave astronomy. The orbital eccentricity is believed to be a precious tracer of the underlying formation pathway, but is largely dissipated during the usually long inspiral between black hole formation and merger. Most gravitational-wave sources are thus expected to enter the sensitivity windows of current detectors on configurations that are compatible with quasi-circular orbits. In this paper, we investigate the impact of "negligible" residual eccentricity -- lower than currently detectable by LIGO/Virgo -- on our ability to infer the formation history of binary black holes, focusing in particular on their spin orientations. We trace the evolution of both observed and synthetic gravitational-wave events backward in time, while resampling their residual eccentricities to values that are below the detectability threshold. Eccentricities in-band as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ can lead to significant biases when reconstructing the spin directions, especially in the case of loud, highly precessing systems. Residual eccentricity thus act like a systematic uncertainty for our astrophysical inference. As a mitigation strategy, one can marginalize the posterior distribution over the residual eccentricity using astrophysical predictions.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the asymptotic symmetries of electromagnetism non-minimally coupled to scalar fields, with non-minimal couplings of the Fermi type that occur in extended supergravity models. Our study is carried out at spatial infinity where minimal and non-minimal couplings exhibit very different asymptotic properties: while the former generically cannot be neglected at infinity, the latter can. Electromagnetic non-minimal couplings are in that respect similar to gravitational minimal couplings, which are also asymptotically subdominant. Because the non-minimally interacting model is asymptotic to the free one, its asymptotic symmetries are the same as the ones of the free theory, i.e., described by angle-dependent $u(1)$ gauge transformations. We also analyse the duality symmetry and show that it is broken to its compact subgroup by the asymptotic conditions. Finally, we consider logarithmic gauge transformations and use them to simplify the symmetry algebra.</description>

Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), more generally, BHs, undergo evaporation and, in principle, will end their lives in bursts of very high-energy gamma rays. The notable aspect of the PBHs with an initial mass of $\sim10^{14}$ g is that they are expected to end their lives today. In this work, we assess the potential sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) in detecting the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that LHAASO is capable of probing for PBH bursts within a proximity of $\sim0.1$ pc from the Sun, measuring a local burst rate density of $\sim$ 1200 (or 700)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with $99\%$ confidence during a 3-year (or 5-year) observational campaign. This level of sensitivity surpasses the most rigorous observational constraint provided by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we propose data analysis strategies for LHAASO to optimize the search for PBHs and reach its potential detection limits.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>
