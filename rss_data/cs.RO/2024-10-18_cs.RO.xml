      <title>Resolving Positional Ambiguity in Dialogues by Vision-Language Models for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an autonomous navigation robot that can accept human commands through natural language to provide services in an indoor environment. These natural language commands may include time, position, object, and action components. However, we observe that the positional components within such commands usually refer to objects in the environment that may contain different levels of positional ambiguity. For example, the command "Go to the chair!" may be ambiguous when there are multiple chairs of the same type in a room. In order to disambiguate these commands, we employ a large language model and a large vision-language model to conduct multiple turns of conversations with the user. We propose a two-level approach that utilizes a vision-language model to map the meanings in natural language to a unique object ID in images and then performs another mapping from the unique object ID to a 3D depth map, thereby allowing the robot to navigate from its current position to the target position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work linking foundation models to the positional ambiguity issue.</description>

      <title>PC-Planner: Physics-Constrained Self-Supervised Learning for Robust Neural Motion Planning with Shape-Aware Distance Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion Planning (MP) is a critical challenge in robotics, especially pertinent with the burgeoning interest in embodied artificial intelligence. Traditional MP methods often struggle with high-dimensional complexities. Recently neural motion planners, particularly physics-informed neural planners based on the Eikonal equation, have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, these methods perform poorly in complex scenarios with shaped robots due to multiple solutions inherent in the Eikonal equation. To address these issues, this paper presents PC-Planner, a novel physics-constrained self-supervised learning framework for robot motion planning with various shapes in complex environments. To this end, we propose several physical constraints, including monotonic and optimal constraints, to stabilize the training process of the neural network with the Eikonal equation. Additionally, we introduce a novel shape-aware distance field that considers the robot's shape for efficient collision checking and Ground Truth (GT) speed computation. This field reduces the computational intensity, and facilitates adaptive motion planning at test time. Experiments in diverse scenarios with different robots demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in efficiency and robustness for robot motion planning, particularly in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based deep reinforcement learning approach to spatial navigation in a partially observable Morris Water Maze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental cognitive skill extensively studied in neuroscientific experiments and has lately gained substantial interest in artificial intelligence research. Recreating the task solved by rodents in the well-established Morris Water Maze (MWM) experiment, this work applies a transformer-based architecture using deep reinforcement learning -- an approach previously unexplored in this context -- to navigate a 2D version of the maze. Specifically, the agent leverages a decoder-only transformer architecture serving as a deep Q-network performing effective decision making in the partially observable environment. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture enables the agent to efficiently learn spatial navigation strategies, overcoming challenges associated with a limited field of vision, corresponding to the visual information available to a rodent in the MWM. Demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models for enhancing navigation performance in partially observable environments, this work suggests promising avenues for future research in artificial agents whose behavior resembles that of biological agents. Finally, the flexibility of the transformer architecture in supporting varying input sequence lengths opens opportunities for gaining increased understanding of the artificial agent's inner representation of the environment.</description>

      <title>BlabberSeg: Real-Time Embedded Open-Vocabulary Aerial Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time aerial image segmentation plays an important role in the environmental perception of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We introduce BlabberSeg, an optimized Vision-Language Model built on CLIPSeg for on-board, real-time processing of aerial images by UAVs. BlabberSeg improves the efficiency of CLIPSeg by reusing prompt and model features, reducing computational overhead while achieving real-time open-vocabulary aerial segmentation. We validated BlabberSeg in a safe landing scenario using the Dynamic Open-Vocabulary Enhanced SafE-Landing with Intelligence (DOVESEI) framework, which uses visual servoing and open-vocabulary segmentation. BlabberSeg reduces computational costs significantly, with a speed increase of 927.41% (16.78 Hz) on a NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX (64GB) compared with the original CLIPSeg (1.81Hz), achieving real-time aerial segmentation with negligible loss in accuracy (2.1% as the ratio of the correctly segmented area with respect to CLIPSeg). BlabberSeg's source code is open and available online.</description>

      <title>Risk Assessment for Autonomous Landing in Urban Environments using Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the vision-based autonomous landing problem in complex urban environments using deep neural networks for semantic segmentation and risk assessment. We propose employing the SegFormer, a state-of-the-art visual transformer network, for the semantic segmentation of complex, unstructured urban environments. This approach yields valuable information that can be utilized in smart autonomous landing missions, particularly in emergency landing scenarios resulting from system failures or human errors. The assessment is done in real-time flight, when images of an RGB camera at the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are segmented with the SegFormer into the most common classes found in urban environments. These classes are then mapped into a level of risk, considering in general, potential material damage, damaging the drone itself and endanger people. The proposed strategy is validated through several case studies, demonstrating the huge potential of semantic segmentation-based strategies to determining the safest landing areas for autonomous emergency landing, which we believe will help unleash the full potential of UAVs on civil applications within urban areas.</description>

      <title>Configurable Embodied Data Generation for Class-Agnostic RGB-D Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating large-scale datasets to improve class-agnostic video segmentation across robots with different form factors. Specifically, we consider the question of whether video segmentation models trained on generic segmentation data could be more effective for particular robot platforms if robot embodiment is factored into the data generation process. To answer this question, a pipeline is formulated for using 3D reconstructions (e.g. from HM3DSem) to generate segmented videos that are configurable based on a robot's embodiment (e.g. sensor type, sensor placement, and illumination source). A resulting massive RGB-D video panoptic segmentation dataset (MVPd) is introduced for extensive benchmarking with foundation and video segmentation models, as well as to support embodiment-focused research in video segmentation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that using MVPd for finetuning can lead to performance improvements when transferring foundation models to certain robot embodiments, such as specific camera placements. These experiments also show that using 3D modalities (depth images and camera pose) can lead to improvements in video segmentation accuracy and consistency.

      <title>Flex: End-to-End Text-Instructed Visual Navigation with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end learning directly maps sensory inputs to actions, creating highly integrated and efficient policies for complex robotics tasks. However, such models are tricky to efficiently train and often struggle to generalize beyond their training scenarios, limiting adaptability to new environments, tasks, and concepts. In this work, we investigate the minimal data requirements and architectural adaptations necessary to achieve robust closed-loop performance with vision-based control policies under unseen text instructions and visual distribution shifts. To this end, we design datasets with various levels of data representation richness, refine feature extraction protocols by leveraging multi-modal foundation model encoders, and assess the suitability of different policy network heads. Our findings are synthesized in Flex (Fly-lexically), a framework that uses pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) as frozen patch-wise feature extractors, generating spatially aware embeddings that integrate semantic and visual information. These rich features form the basis for training highly robust downstream policies capable of generalizing across platforms, environments, and text-specified tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on quadrotor fly-to-target tasks, where agents trained via behavior cloning on a small simulated dataset successfully generalize to real-world scenes, handling diverse novel goals and command formulations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Stiffness and Programmable Actuation for Soft Robots Enabled by an Inflated Rotational Joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots are known for their ability to perform tasks with great adaptability, enabled by their distributed, non-uniform stiffness and actuation. Bending is the most fundamental motion for soft robot design, but creating robust, and easy-to-fabricate soft bending joint with tunable properties remains an active problem of research. In this work, we demonstrate an inflatable actuation module for soft robots with a defined bending plane enabled by forced partial wrinkling. This lowers the structural stiffness in the bending direction, with the final stiffness easily designed by the ratio of wrinkled and unwrinkled regions. We present models and experimental characterization showing the stiffness properties of the actuation module, as well as its ability to maintain the kinematic constraint over a large range of loading conditions. We demonstrate the potential for complex actuation in a soft continuum robot and for decoupling actuation force and efficiency from load capacity. The module provides a novel method for embedding intelligent actuation into soft pneumatic robots.</description>

      <title>GyroCopter: Differential Bearing Measuring Trajectory Planner for Tracking and Localizing Radio Frequency Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles can provide efficient and effective solutions for radio frequency (RF) source tracking and localizing problems with applications ranging from wildlife conservation to search and rescue operations. Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Just Add Force for Contact-Rich Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot trajectories used for learning end-to-end robot policies typically contain end-effector and gripper position, workspace images, and language. Policies learned from such trajectories are unsuitable for delicate grasping, which require tightly coupled and precise gripper force and gripper position. We collect and make publically available 130 trajectories with force feedback of successful grasps on 30 unique objects. Our current-based method for sensing force, albeit noisy, is gripper-agnostic and requires no additional hardware. We train and evaluate two diffusion policies: one with (forceful) the collected force feedback and one without (position-only). We find that forceful policies are superior to position-only policies for delicate grasping and are able to generalize to unseen delicate objects, while reducing grasp policy latency by near 4x, relative to LLM-based methods. With our promising results on limited data, we hope to signal to others to consider investing in collecting force and other such tactile information in new datasets, enabling more robust, contact-rich manipulation in future robot foundation models.

      <description>arXiv:2410.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown promising results for learning end-to-end robot policies using imitation learning. In this work we address the question of how far can we push imitation learning for challenging dexterous manipulation tasks. We show that a simple recipe of large scale data collection on the ALOHA 2 platform, combined with expressive models such as Diffusion Policies, can be effective in learning challenging bimanual manipulation tasks involving deformable objects and complex contact rich dynamics. We demonstrate our recipe on 5 challenging real-world and 3 simulated tasks and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Power in Numbers: Primitive Algorithm for Swarm Robot Navigation in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the navigation of mobile robots in unknown environments has become a particularly significant research topic. Previous studies have primarily employed real-time environmental mapping using cameras and LiDAR, along with self-localization and path generation based on those maps. Additionally, there is research on Sim-to-Real transfer, where robots acquire behaviors through pre-trained reinforcement learning and apply these learned actions in real-world navigation. However, strictly the observe action and modelling of unknown environments that change unpredictably over time with accuracy and precision is an extremely complex endeavor. This study proposes a simple navigation algorithm for traversing unknown environments by utilizes the number of swarm robots. The proposed algorithm assumes that the robot has only the simple function of sensing the direction of the goal and the relative positions of the surrounding robots. The robots can navigate an unknown environment by simply continuing towards the goal while bypassing surrounding robots. The method does not need to sense the environment, determine whether they or other robots are stuck, or do the complicated inter-robot communication. We mathematically validate the proposed navigation algorithm, present numerical simulations based on the potential field method, and conduct experimental demonstrations using developed robots based on the sound fields for navigation.</description>

      <title>TRLO: An Efficient LiDAR Odometry with 3D Dynamic Object Tracking and Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous state estimation and mapping is an essential capability for mobile robots working in dynamic urban environment. The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</description>

      <title>Arc-Length-Based Warping for Robot Skill Synthesis from Multiple Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotics, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) aims to transfer skills to robots by using multiple demonstrations of the same task. These demonstrations are recorded and processed to extract a consistent skill representation. This process typically requires temporal alignment through techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm, named Spatial Sampling (SS), specifically designed for robot trajectories, that enables time-independent alignment of the trajectories by providing an arc-length parametrization of the signals. This approach eliminates the need for temporal alignment, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of skill representation. Specifically, we show that large time shifts in the demonstrated trajectories can introduce uncertainties in the synthesis of the final trajectory, which alignment in the arc-length domain can drastically reduce, in comparison with various state-of-the-art time-based signal alignment algorithms. To this end, we built a custom publicly available dataset of robot recordings to test real-world trajectories.</description>

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) emphasizes agents' ability to perceive, understand, and act in physical environments. Simulation platforms play a crucial role in advancing this field by enabling the validation and optimization of algorithms. However, existing platforms face challenges such as multilevel technical integration complexity, insufficient modularity, interface heterogeneity, and adaptation to diverse hardware. We present BestMan, a simulation platform based on PyBullet, designed to address these issues. BestMan introduces an integrated multilevel skill chain for seamless coordination across perception, planning, and control; a highly modular architecture for flexible algorithm integration; unified interfaces for smooth simulation-to-reality transfer; and a hardware-agnostic approach for adapting to various mobile manipulator configurations. These features collectively simplify development and enhance platform expandability, making BestMan a valuable tool for Embodied AI research.</description>

      <title>RAMPA: Robotic Augmented Reality for Machine Programming and Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robotics continue to enter various sectors beyond traditional industrial applications, the need for intuitive robot training and interaction systems becomes increasingly more important. This paper introduces Robotic Augmented Reality for Machine Programming (RAMPA), a system that utilizes the capabilities of state-of-the-art and commercially available AR headsets, e.g., Meta Quest 3, to facilitate the application of Programming from Demonstration (PfD) approaches on industrial robotic arms, such as Universal Robots UR10. Our approach enables in-situ data recording, visualization, and fine-tuning of skill demonstrations directly within the user's physical environment. RAMPA addresses critical challenges of PfD, such as safety concerns, programming barriers, and the inefficiency of collecting demonstrations on the actual hardware. The performance of our system is evaluated against the traditional method of kinesthetic control in teaching three different robotic manipulation tasks and analyzed with quantitative metrics, measuring task performance and completion time, trajectory smoothness, system usability, user experience, and task load using standardized surveys. Our findings indicate a substantial advancement in how robotic tasks are taught and refined, promising improvements in operational safety, efficiency, and user engagement in robotic programming.</description>

      <title>Interactive Navigation with Adaptive Non-prehensile Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for interactive navigation through adaptive non-prehensile mobile manipulation. A key challenge in this process is handling objects with unknown dynamics, which are difficult to infer from visual observation. To address this, we propose an adaptive dynamics model for common movable indoor objects via learned SE(2) dynamics representations. This model is integrated into Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to guide the robot's interactions. Additionally, the learned dynamics help inform decision-making when navigating around objects that cannot be manipulated.Our approach is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent object dynamics and effectively manipulate various objects. We further highlight its success in the Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO) task by deploying the proposed framework on a dynamically balancing mobile robot, Shmoobot.

      <title>Novelty-based Sample Reuse for Continuous Robotics Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, agents collect state information and rewards through environmental interactions, essential for policy refinement. This process is notably time-consuming, especially in complex robotic simulations and real-world applications. Traditional algorithms usually re-engage with the environment after processing a single batch of samples, thereby failing to fully capitalize on historical data. However, frequently observed states, with reliable value estimates, require minimal updates; in contrast, rare observed states necessitate more intensive updates for achieving accurate value estimations. To address uneven sample utilization, we propose Novelty-guided Sample Reuse (NSR). NSR provides extra updates for infrequent, novel states and skips additional updates for frequent states, maximizing sample use before interacting with the environment again. Our experiments show that NSR improves the convergence rate and success rate of algorithms without significantly increasing time consumption. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ppksigs/NSR-DDPG-HER.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Transformers for Agile Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a state estimation method that can accurately predict the robot's privileged states to push the limits of quadruped robots in executing advanced skills such as jumping in the wild. In particular, we present the State Estimation Transformers (SET), an architecture that casts the state estimation problem as conditional sequence modeling. SET outputs the robot states that are hard to obtain directly in the real world, such as the body height and velocities, by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the robot's past states, our SET model can predict these privileged observations accurately even in highly dynamic locomotions. We evaluate our methods on three tasks -- running jumping, running backflipping, and running sideslipping -- on a low-cost quadruped robot, Cyberdog2. Results show that SET can outperform other methods in estimation accuracy and transferability in the simulation as well as success rates of jumping and triggering a recovery controller in the real world, suggesting the superiority of such a Transformer-based explicit state estimator in highly dynamic locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>CERES: Critical-Event Reconstruction via Temporal Scene Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for on-demand scenario generation in simulation, grounded on real-world data. Evaluating the behaviour of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in both safety-critical and regular scenarios is essential for assessing their robustness before real-world deployment. By integrating scenarios derived from real-world datasets into the simulation, we enhance the plausibility and validity of testing sets. This work introduces a novel approach that employs temporal scene graphs to capture evolving spatiotemporal relationships among scene entities from a real-world dataset, enabling the generation of dynamic scenarios in simulation through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). User-defined action and criticality conditioning are used to ensure flexible, tailored scenario creation. Our model significantly outperforms the benchmarks in accurately predicting links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We further evaluate the validity and compatibility of our generated scenarios in an off-the-shelf simulator.</description>

      <title>DualQuat-LOAM: LiDAR Odometry and Mapping parametrized on Dual Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on a novel method for LiDAR odometry estimation, which completely parameterizes the system with dual quaternions. To accomplish this, the features derived from the point cloud, including edges, surfaces, and Stable Triangle Descriptor (STD), along with the optimization problem, are expressed in the dual quaternion set. This approach enables the direct combination of translation and orientation errors via dual quaternion operations, greatly enhancing pose estimation, as demonstrated in comparative experiments against other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach reduced drift error compared to other LiDAR-only-odometry methods, especially in scenarios with sharp curves and aggressive movements with large angular displacement. DualQuat-LOAM is benchmarked against several public datasets. In the KITTI dataset it has a translation and rotation error of 0.79% and 0.0039{\deg}/m, with an average run time of 53 ms.</description>

      <title>SPF-EMPC Planner: A real-time multi-robot trajectory planner for complex environments with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical applications, the unpredictable movement of obstacles and the imprecise state observation of robots introduce significant uncertainties for the swarm of robots, especially in cluster environments. However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, offline policy is sensitive to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) states due to the limited state coverage in the datasets. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework combining offline learning and online preference alignment for legged locomotion control. Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planer, which significantly addresses the OOD issues and improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under both slow- and high-speed scenarios and can perform zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

      <title>Automatic Navigation and Voice Cloning Technology Deployment on a Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots have shown immense potential and are expected to be widely used in the service industry. The importance of automatic navigation and voice cloning cannot be overstated as they enable functional robots to provide high-quality services. The objective of this work is to develop a control algorithm for the automatic navigation of a humanoid mobile robot called Cruzr, which is a service robot manufactured by Ubtech. Initially, a virtual environment is constructed in the simulation software Gazebo using Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), and global path planning is carried out by means of local path tracking. The two-wheel differential chassis kinematics model is employed to ensure autonomous dynamic obstacle avoidance for the robot chassis. Furthermore, the mapping and trajectory generation algorithms developed in the simulation environment are successfully implemented on the real robot Cruzr. The performance of automatic navigation is compared between the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms. Additionally, a mobile application for voice cloning is created based on a Hidden Markov Model, and the proposed Chatbot is also tested and deployed on Cruzr.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLM-Controlled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive human-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and self-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit harmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of deploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first algorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual attacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from LLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three scenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the NVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker has partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a GPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only query access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each scenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we demonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds jailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates. Our results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs extend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that jailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our results on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a deployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is critical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media is available at: https://robopair.org</description>

      <title>Interacting humans and robots can improve sensory prediction by adapting their viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To manipulate objects or dance together, humans and robots exchange energy and haptic information. While the exchange of energy in human-robot interaction has been extensively investigated, the underlying exchange of haptic information is not well understood. Here, we develop a computational model of the mechanical and sensory interactions between agents that can tune their viscoelasticity while considering their sensory and motor noise. The resulting stochastic-optimal-information-and-effort (SOIE) controller predicts how the exchange of haptic information and the performance can be improved by adjusting viscoelasticity. This controller was first implemented on a robot-robot experiment with a tracking task which showed its superior performance when compared to either stiff or compliant control. Importantly, the optimal controller also predicts how connected humans alter their muscle activation to improve haptic communication, with differentiated viscoelasticity adjustment to their own sensing noise and haptic perturbations. A human-robot experiment then illustrated the applicability of this optimal control strategy for robots, yielding improved tracking performance and effective haptic communication as the robot adjusted its viscoelasticity according to its own and the user's noise characteristics. The proposed SOIE controller may thus be used to improve haptic communication and collaboration of humans and robots.</description>

      <title>CLIMB: Language-Guided Continual Learning for Task Planning with Iterative Model Building</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent and reliable task planning is a core capability for generalized robotics, requiring a descriptive domain representation that sufficiently models all object and state information for the scene. We present CLIMB, a continual learning framework for robot task planning that leverages foundation models and execution feedback to guide domain model construction. CLIMB can build a model from a natural language description, learn non-obvious predicates while solving tasks, and store that information for future problems. We demonstrate the ability of CLIMB to improve performance in common planning environments compared to baseline methods. We also develop the BlocksWorld++ domain, a simulated environment with an easily usable real counterpart, together with a curriculum of tasks with progressing difficulty for evaluating continual learning. Additional details and demonstrations for this system can be found at https://plan-with-climb.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Steering Your Generalists: Improving Robotic Foundation Models via Value Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, general-purpose robotic policies trained on diverse demonstration datasets have been shown to be remarkably effective both for controlling a variety of robots in a range of different scenes, and for acquiring broad repertoires of manipulation skills. However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally of mixed quality -- not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist robot policies at deployment time by re-ranking their actions according to a value function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies, without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that the same value function can improve the performance of five different state-of-the-art policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms across a total of 12 tasks.

      <title>Guided Reinforcement Learning for Robust Multi-Contact Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) often necessitates a meticulous Markov Decision Process (MDP) design tailored to each task. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing a systematic approach to behavior synthesis and control for multi-contact loco-manipulation tasks, such as navigating spring-loaded doors and manipulating heavy dishwashers. We define a task-independent MDP to train RL policies using only a single demonstration per task generated from a model-based trajectory optimizer. Our approach incorporates an adaptive phase dynamics formulation to robustly track the demonstrations while accommodating dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. We compare our method against prior motion imitation RL works and show that the learned policies achieve higher success rates across all considered tasks. These policies learn recovery maneuvers that are not present in the demonstration, such as re-grasping objects during execution or dealing with slippages. Finally, we successfully transfer the policies to a real robot, demonstrating the practical viability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards a Factor Graph-Based Method using Angular Rates for Full Magnetometer Calibration and Gyroscope Bias Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MEMS Attitude Heading Reference Systems are widely employed to determine a system's attitude, but sensor measurement biases limit their accuracy. This paper introduces a novel factor graph-based method called MAgnetometer and GYroscope Calibration (MAGYC). MAGYC leverages three-axis angular rate measurements from an angular rate gyroscope to enhance calibration for batch and online applications. Our approach imposes less restrictive conditions for instrument movements required for calibration, eliminates the need for knowledge of the local magnetic field or instrument attitude, and facilitates integration into factor graph algorithms within Smoothing and Mapping frameworks. We evaluate the proposed methods through numerical simulations and in-field experimental assessments using a sensor installed on an underwater vehicle. Ultimately, our proposed methods reduced the underwater vehicle's heading error standard deviation from 6.21 to 0.57 degrees for a standard seafloor mapping survey.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subsampling and Learned Model Improve Spatiotemporal Resolution of Tactile Skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed tactile arrays are essential for real-time robotic control in unstructured environments, but high pixel counts limit readout rates of most large tactile arrays to below 100Hz. We introduce ACTS - adaptive compressive tactile subsampling - a method that efficiently samples tactile matrices and reconstructs interactions using sparse recovery and a learned tactile dictionary. Tested on a 1024-pixel sensor array (32x32), ACTS increased frame rates by 18X compared to raster scanning, with minimal error. For the first time in large-area tactile skin, we demonstrate rapid object classification within 20ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and deformation tracking through enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Our method can be implemented in firmware, upgrading existing low-cost, flexible, and robust tactile arrays into high-resolution systems for large-area spatiotemporal touch sensing.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Robot Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on massive amounts of visual data have shown unprecedented reasoning and planning skills in open-world settings. A key challenge in applying them to robotic tasks is the modality gap between visual data and action data. We introduce differentiable robot rendering, a method allowing the visual appearance of a robot body to be directly differentiable with respect to its control parameters. Our model integrates a kinematics-aware deformable model and Gaussians Splatting and is compatible with any robot form factors and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.</description>

      <title>ORSO: Accelerating Reward Design via Online Reward Selection and Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward shaping is a critical component in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for complex tasks where sparse rewards can hinder learning. While shaping rewards have been introduced to provide additional guidance, selecting effective shaping functions remains challenging and computationally expensive. This paper introduces Online Reward Selection and Policy Optimization (ORSO), a novel approach that frames shaping reward selection as an online model selection problem. ORSO employs principled exploration strategies to automatically identify promising shaping reward functions without human intervention, balancing exploration and exploitation with provable regret guarantees. We demonstrate ORSO's effectiveness across various continuous control tasks using the Isaac Gym simulator. Compared to traditional methods that fully evaluate each shaping reward function, ORSO significantly improves sample efficiency, reduces computational time, and consistently identifies high-quality reward functions that produce policies comparable to those generated by domain experts through hand-engineered rewards.</description>

      <title>VLM-Grounder: A VLM Agent for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding is crucial for robots, requiring integration of natural language and 3D scene understanding. Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors. Codes are available at https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/VLM-Grounder .</description>

      <title>D$^3$Fields: Dynamic 3D Descriptor Fields for Zero-Shot Generalizable Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene representation is a crucial design choice in robotic manipulation systems. An ideal representation is expected to be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields -- dynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields are implicit 3D representations that take in 3D points and output semantic features and instance masks. They can also capture the dynamics of the underlying 3D environments. Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view 2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from visual foundational models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our representation to rearrangement tasks in a zero-shot manner. Through extensive evaluation in real worlds and simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are effective for zero-shot generalizable rearrangement tasks. We also compare D$^3$Fields with state-of-the-art implicit 3D representations and show significant improvements in effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the potential applications of machine learning to Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) have spurred interest in data sets that can be used to develop data-driven tools. This paper introduces a novel dataset recorded during ex vivo pseudo-cholecystectomy procedures on pig livers, utilizing the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Unlike current datasets, ours bridges a critical gap by offering not only full kinematic data but also capturing all pedal inputs used during the procedure and providing a time-stamped record of the endoscope's movements. Contributed by seven surgeons, this data set introduces a new dimension to surgical robotics research, allowing the creation of advanced models for automating console functionalities. Our work addresses the existing limitation of incomplete recordings and imprecise kinematic data, common in other datasets. By introducing two models, dedicated to predicting clutch usage and camera activation, we highlight the dataset's potential for advancing automation in surgical robotics. The comparison of methodologies and time windows provides insights into the models' boundaries and limitations.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI with Two Arms: Zero-shot Learning, Safety and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an embodied AI system which receives open-ended natural language instructions from a human, and controls two arms to collaboratively accomplish potentially long-horizon tasks over a large workspace. Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies. https://sites.google.com/corp/view/safe-robots</description>

      <title>CooHOI: Learning Cooperative Human-Object Interaction with Manipulated Object Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in humanoid control, largely due to the availability of large-scale motion capture data and the application of reinforcement learning methodologies. However, many real-world tasks, such as moving large and heavy furniture, require multi-character collaboration. Given the scarcity of data on multi-character collaboration and the efficiency challenges associated with multi-agent learning, these tasks cannot be straightforwardly addressed using training paradigms designed for single-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Cooperative Human-Object Interaction (CooHOI), a novel framework that addresses multi-character objects transporting through a two-phase learning paradigm: individual skill acquisition and subsequent transfer. Initially, a single agent learns to perform tasks using the Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) framework. Following this, the agent learns to collaborate with others by considering the shared dynamics of the manipulated object during parallel training using Multi Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO). When one agent interacts with the object, resulting in specific object dynamics changes, the other agents learn to respond appropriately, thereby achieving implicit communication and coordination between teammates. Unlike previous approaches that relied on tracking-based methods for multi-character HOI, CooHOI is inherently efficient, does not depend on motion capture data of multi-character interactions, and can be seamlessly extended to include more participants and a wide range of object types.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Splatting to Real World Flight Navigation Transfer with Liquid Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulators are powerful tools for autonomous robot learning as they offer scalable data generation, flexible design, and optimization of trajectories. However, transferring behavior learned from simulation data into the real world proves to be difficult, usually mitigated with compute-heavy domain randomization methods or further model fine-tuning. We present a method to improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts in sim-to-real visual quadrotor navigation tasks. To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned Liquid policies, trained on single target manoeuvres curated from a photorealistic simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware platform outdoors.</description>

      <title>Motion Accuracy and Computational Effort in QP-based Robot Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Programs (QPs) have become a mature technology for the control of robots of all kinds, including humanoid robots. One aspect has been largely overlooked, however, which is the accuracy with which these QPs should be solved. QP solvers aim at providing solutions accurate up to floating point precision ($\approx10^{-8}$). Considering physical quantities expressed in SI or similar units (meters, radians, etc.), such precision seems completely unrelated to both task requirements and hardware capacity. Typically, humanoid robots never achieve, nor are capable of achieving sub-millimeter precision in manipulation tasks. With this observation in mind, our objectives in this paper are two-fold: first examine how the QP solution accuracy impacts the resulting robot motion accuracy, then evaluate how a reduced solution accuracy requirement can be leveraged to reduce the corresponding computational effort. Experiments with a dynamic simulation of RHPS-1 humanoid robot indicate that computational effort can be divided by more than 27 while maintaining the desired motion accuracy.</description>

      <title>KOI: Accelerating Online Imitation Learning via Hybrid Key-state Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online Imitation Learning struggles with the gap between extensive online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, hindering efficient exploration due to inaccurate reward estimation. Inspired by the findings from cognitive neuroscience, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware reward for efficient online exploration, through decomposing the target task into the objectives of "what to do" and the mechanisms of "how to do". In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning method, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for reward estimation. Initially, we utilize visual-language models to extract semantic key states from expert trajectory, indicating the objectives of "what to do". Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow is employed to capture motion key states to understand the mechanisms of "how to do". By integrating a thorough grasp of hybrid key states, we refine the trajectory-matching reward computation, accelerating online imitation learning with task-aware exploration. We evaluate not only the success rate of the tasks in the Meta-World and LIBERO environments, but also the trend of variance during online imitation learning, proving that our method is more sample efficient. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability of our KOI method.

      <title>MASQ: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Quadruped Robot Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to improve locomotion learning for a single quadruped robot using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Many existing methods use single-agent reinforcement learning for an individual robot or MARL for the cooperative task in multi-robot systems. Unlike existing methods, this paper proposes using MARL for the locomotion learning of a single quadruped robot. We develop a learning structure called Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Quadruped Robot Locomotion (MASQ), considering each leg as an agent to explore the action space of the quadruped robot, sharing a global critic, and learning collaboratively. Experimental results indicate that MASQ not only speeds up learning convergence but also enhances robustness in real-world settings, suggesting that applying MASQ to single robots such as quadrupeds could surpass traditional single-robot reinforcement learning approaches. Our study provides insightful guidance on integrating MARL with single-robot locomotion learning.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning For Robust Robotic Grasping In Dynamic Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the threats in the dynamic environment include the unpredictability of the motion of objects and interferences to the robotic grasp. In such conditions the traditional supervised and reinforcement learning approaches are ill suited because they rely on a large amount of labelled data and a predefined reward signal. More specifically in this paper we introduce an important and promising framework known as self supervised learning (SSL) whose goal is to apply to the RGBD sensor and proprioceptive data from robot hands in order to allow robots to learn and improve their grasping strategies in real time. The invariant SSL framework overcomes the deficiencies of the fixed labelling by adapting the SSL system to changes in the objects behavior and improving performance in dynamic situations. The above proposed method was tested through various simulations and real world trials, with the series obtaining enhanced grasp success rates of 15% over other existing methods, especially under dynamic scenarios. Also, having tested for adaptation times, it was confirmed that the system could adapt faster, thus applicable for use in the real world, such as in industrial automation and service robotics. In future work, the proposed approach will be expanded to more complex tasks, such as multi object manipulation and functions in the context of cluttered environments, in order to apply the proposed methodology to a broader range of robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Long-term Language-Guided Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling mobile robots to perform long-term tasks in dynamic real-world environments is a formidable challenge, especially when the environment changes frequently due to human-robot interactions or the robot's own actions. Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

      <title>A Data-driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</description>

      <title>Music to Dance as Language Translation using Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesising appropriate choreographies from music remains an open problem. We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation problem as a translation task. Our method leverages an existing data set to learn to translate sequences of audio into corresponding dance poses. We present two variants of MDLT: one utilising the Transformer architecture and the other employing the Mamba architecture. We train our method on AIST++ and PhantomDance data sets to teach a robotic arm to dance, but our method can be applied to a full humanoid robot. Evaluation metrics, including Average Joint Error and Fr\'echet Inception Distance, consistently demonstrate that, when given a piece of music, MDLT excels at producing realistic and high-quality choreography. The code can be found at github.com/meowatthemoon/MDLT.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Flexible Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer while ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding and excluding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. We leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law in managing arbitrarily maneuvering targets and other uncertainties (such as vehicle/autopilot dynamics and external disturbances) by enabling the pursuer to consistently achieve stable global enclosing behaviors by switching between stable enclosing trajectories within the safe region whenever necessary, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers. To attest to the merits of our work, we conduct experimental tests with various plant models, including a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios and requiring only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>t-READi: Transformer-Powered Robust and Efficient Multimodal Inference for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the wide adoption of multimodal sensors (e.g., camera, lidar, radar) by autonomous vehicles (AVs), deep analytics to fuse their outputs for a robust perception become imperative. However, existing fusion methods often make two assumptions rarely holding in practice: i) similar data distributions for all inputs and ii) constant availability for all sensors. Because, for example, lidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such variability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To this end, we present tREADi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the variability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient perception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model parameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact. t-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to compensate for the loss from missing modalities. Both functions are implemented to maintain compatibility with existing multimodal deep fusion methods. The extensive experiments evidently demonstrate that compared with the status quo approaches, t-READi not only improves the average inference accuracy by more than 6% but also reduces the inference latency by almost 15x with the cost of only 5% extra memory overhead in the worst case under realistic data and modal variations.</description>

      <title>RPCBF: Constructing Safety Filters Robust to Model Error and Disturbances via Policy Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have proven to be an effective tool for performing safe control synthesis for nonlinear systems. However, guaranteeing safety in the presence of disturbances and input constraints for high relative degree systems is a difficult problem. In this work, we propose the Robust Policy CBF (RPCBF), a practical method of constructing CBF approximations that is easy to implement and robust to disturbances via the estimation of a value function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation on a variety of high relative degree input-constrained systems. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of RPCBF in compensating for model errors on a hardware quadcopter platform by treating the model errors as disturbances.
