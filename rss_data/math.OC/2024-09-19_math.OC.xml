      <title>Convergence of Markov Chains for Constant Step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent with Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (non-convex) objective functions, we establish a "Doeblin-type decomposition," in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show: (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a "splitting condition" of Dubins and Freedman 1966 and Bhattacharya and Lee 1988.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Extremum Seeking Control via the RMSprop Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) is a well-known set of continuous time algorithms for model-free optimization of a cost function. One issue for ESCs is the convergence rates of parameters to extrema of unknown cost functions. The local convergence rate depends on the second, or sometimes higher, order derivatives of the unknown cost function. To mitigate this dependency, we propose the use of the RMSprop optimizer for ESCs as RMSprop is an adaptive gradient-based optimizer which attempts to have a normalized convergence rate in all parameters. Practical stability results are given for this RMSprop ESC (RMSpESC). In particular notability, the proof of practical stability uses Lyapunov function based on observed contracting, attractive sets. Versions of this Lyapunov function could be applied to other areas of applications, in particular for interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Computing Bouligand stationary points efficiently in low-rank optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of minimizing a differentiable function with locally Lipschitz continuous gradient on the algebraic variety of all $m$-by-$n$ real matrices of rank at most $r$. Several definitions of stationarity exist for this nonconvex problem. Among them, Bouligand stationarity is the strongest necessary condition for local optimality. Only a handful of algorithms generate a sequence in the variety whose accumulation points are provably Bouligand stationary. Among them, the most parsimonious with (truncated) singular value decompositions (SVDs) or eigenvalue decompositions can still require a truncated SVD of a matrix whose rank can be as large as $\min\{m, n\}-r+1$ if the gradient does not have low rank, which is computationally prohibitive in the typical case where $r \ll \min\{m, n\}$. This paper proposes a first-order algorithm that generates a sequence in the variety whose accumulation points are Bouligand stationary while requiring SVDs of matrices whose smaller dimension is always at most $r$. A standard measure of Bouligand stationarity converges to zero along the bounded subsequences at a rate at least $O(1/\sqrt{i+1})$, where $i$ is the iteration counter. Furthermore, a rank-increasing scheme based on the proposed algorithm is presented, which can be of interest if the parameter $r$ is potentially overestimated.</description>

      <title>Seperable Bregman Framework for Sparsity Constrained Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the minimization of a continuously differentiable function over a cardinality constraint. We focus on smooth and relatively smooth functions. These smoothness criteria result in new descent lemmas. Based on the new descent lemmas, novel optimality conditions and algorithms are developed, which extend the previously proposed hard-thresholding algorithms. We give a theoretical analysis of these algorithms and extend previous results on properties of iterative hard thresholding-like algorithms. In particular, we focus on the weighted $\ell_2$ norm, which requires efficient solution of convex subproblems. We apply our algorithms to compressed sensing problems to demonstrate the theoretical findings and the enhancements achieved through the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Superlinear Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed optimization problems, where each agent cooperatively minimizes the sum of local objective functions through the communication with its neighbors. The widely adopted distributed gradient method in solving this problem suffers from slow convergence rates, which motivates us to incorporate the second-order information of the objective functions. However, the challenge arises from the unique structure of the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which prevents the direct distributed implementation of the second-order method. We overcome this challenge by proposing a novel optimization framework. The key idea is to transform the distributed optimization problem into an optimal control problem. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle and the associated forward-backward difference equations (FBDEs), we derive a new distributed optimization algorithm that incorporates the second-order information without requiring the computation of the inverse of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the superlinear convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved under some mild assumptions. Finally, we also propose a variant of the algorithm to balance the number of iterations and communication.</description>

      <title>Approximate Resolution of Stochastic Choice-based Discrete Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic choice-based discrete planning is a broad class of decision-making problems characterized by a sequential decision-making process involving a planner and a group of customers. The firm or planner first decides a subset of options to offer to the customers, who, in turn, make selections based on their utilities of those options. This problem has extensive applications in many areas, including assortment planning, product line design, and facility location. A key feature of these problems is that the firm cannot fully observe the customers' utilities or preferences, which results in intrinsic and idiosyncratic uncertainties. Most works in the literature have studied a specific type of uncertainty, resulting in customized decision models that are subsequently tackled using ad-hoc algorithms designed to exploit the specific model structure.
  In this paper we propose a modeling framework capable of solving this family of sequential problems that works for a large variety of uncertainties. We then leverage an approximation scheme and develop an adaptable mixed-integer linear programming method. To speed up the solution process, we further develop an efficient decomposition approach. We show that our solution framework can yield solutions proven to be (near-)optimal for a broad class of problems. We illustrate this by applying our approach to three classical application problems: constrained assortment optimization and two facility location problems. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our approach in terms of both solution quality and computational speed, and provide computational insights. In particular, when we use our method to solve the constrained assortment optimization problem under the Exponomial choice model, it improves the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A dynamic optimal reinsurance strategy with capital injections in the Cramer-Lundberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the surplus process of an insurance company within the CramerLundberg framework. We study the optimal reinsurance strategy and dividend distribution of an insurance company under proportional reinsurance, in which capital injections are allowed. Our aim is to find a general dynamic reinsurance strategy that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative dividends until the time of passage below a given level, called ruin. These policies consist in stopping at the first time when the size of the overshoot below 0 exceeds a certain limit, and only pay dividends when the reserve reaches an upper barrier. Using analytical methods, we identify the value function as a particular solution to the associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation. This approach leads to an exhaustive and explicit characterization of optimal policy. The proportional reinsurance is given via comprehensive structure equations. Furthermore we give some examples illustrating the applicability of this method for proportional reinsurance treaties.</description>

      <title>Escaping Local Minima and Saddle Points in High-Dimensional Non-Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high-dimensional non-convex optimization, particularly the inefficiencies caused by saddle points. The authors propose several techniques for detecting, evading, and optimizing in the presence of these saddle points. We begin by analyzing saddle point detection through the Hessian spectrum, showing that the likelihood of encountering saddle points increases with dimensionality. We introduce stochastic gradient perturbation, which adds noise to escape saddle points and avoid premature convergence, and emphasize the importance of gradient flow dynamics and adaptive learning rates in ensuring convergence to local minima. The paper validates these methods within constrained optimization problems and explores randomized subspace optimization, reducing search space dimensionality while maintaining global convergence efficiency. These findings offer a comprehensive framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of high-dimensional non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Picking Operations in Warehouses with Dynamically Arriving Orders: How Good is Reoptimization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce operations are essentially online, with customer orders arriving dynamically. However, very little is known about the performance of online policies for warehousing with respect to optimality, particularly for order picking and batching operations, which constitute a substantial portion of the total operating costs in warehouses. We aim to close this gap for one of the most prominent dynamic algorithms, namely reoptimization (Reopt), which reoptimizes the current solution each time when a new order arrives. We examine Reopt in the Online Order Batching, Sequencing, and Routing Problem (OOBSRP), in both cases when the picker uses either a manual pushcart or a robotic cart. Moreover, we examine the noninterventionist Reopt in the case of a manual pushcart, wherein picking instructions are provided exclusively at the depot. We establish analytical performance bounds employing worst-case and probabilistic analysis. We demonstrate that, under generic stochastic assumptions, Reopt is almost surely asymptotically optimal and, notably, we validate its near-optimal performance in computational experiments across a broad range of warehouse settings. These results underscore Reopt's relevance as a method for online warehousing applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes with Posterior Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (HGPs) that identify unknown systems in a data-driven manner. Although HGPs effectively address the heteroscedasticity of noise in complex training datasets, calculating the exact posterior distributions of the HGPs is challenging, as these distributions are no longer multivariate normal. This study derives the exact means, variances, and cumulative distributions of the posterior distributions. Furthermore, the derived theoretical findings are applied to a chance-constrained tracking controller. After an HGP identifies an unknown disturbance in a plant system, the controller can handle chance constraints regarding the system despite the presence of the disturbance.</description>

      <title>How Many Policies Do We Need in $K$-Adaptability for Two-stage Robust Integer Optimization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of robust optimization the $k$-adaptability approach is one promising method to derive approximate solutions for two-stage robust optimization problems. Instead of allowing all possible second-stage decisions, the $k$-adaptability approach aims at calculating a limited set of $k$ such decisions already in the first-stage before the uncertainty reveals. The parameter $k$ can be adjusted to control the quality of the approximation. However, not much is known on how many solutions $k$ are needed to achieve an optimal solution for the two-stage robust problem. In this work we derive bounds on $k$ which guarantee optimality for general non-linear problems with integer decisions where the uncertainty appears in the objective function or in the constraints. We show that for objective uncertainty the bound is the same as for the linear case and depends linearly on the dimension of the uncertainty, while for constraint uncertainty the dependence can be exponential, still providing the first generic bound for a wide class of problems. The results give new insights on how many solutions are needed for problems as the decision dependent information discovery problem or the capital budgeting problem with constraint uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Prediction Equilibrium for Dynamic Traffic Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic effects significantly influence the dynamics of traffic flows. Many dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models attempt to capture these effects by prescribing a specific ratio that determines how flow splits across different routes based on the routes' costs. In this paper, we propose a new framework for DTA that incorporates the interplay between the routing decisions of each single traffic participant, the stochastic nature of predicting the future state of the network, and the physical flow dynamics. Our framework consists of an edge loading operator modeling the physical flow propagation and a routing operator modeling the routing behavior of traffic participants. The routing operator is assumed to be set-valued and capable to model complex (deterministic) equilibrium conditions as well as stochastic equilibrium conditions assuming that measurements for predicting traffic are noisy. As our main results, we derive several quite general equilibrium existence and uniqueness results which not only subsume known results from the literature but also lead to new results. Specifically, for the new stochastic prediction equilibrium, we show existence and uniqueness under natural assumptions on the probability distribution over the predictions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Representation of General Phase-type Distributions: A Non-convex Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a continuous-time phase-type distribution, starting with its Laplace-Stieltjes transform, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for its minimal phase-type representation to have the same order as the algebraic degree of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform. To facilitate finding this minimal representation, we transform this condition equivalently into a quadratic nonconvex optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using an alternating minimization algorithm. The algorithm convergence is also proved. Moreover, the method we develop for the continuous-time phase-type distributions can be directly used to the discrete-time phase-type distributions after establishing an equivalence between the minimal representation problems for continuous-time and discrete-times phase-type distributions.</description>

      <title>Validating Convex Optimization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces via Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can be designed in various ways. A previously proposed semidefinite relaxation-based optimization method for maximizing power transfer efficiency showed promise, but earlier results were only theoretical. This paper evaluates a small RIS at 3.55GHz, the center of the 5G band "n78", for practical verification of this method. The presented results not only empirically confirm the desired performance of the optimized RIS, but also affirm the optimality of the resulting reactance values. Additionally, this paper discusses several practical aspects of RIS design and measurement, such as the operation of varactor diodes and time gating to omit the direct line-of-sight (LOS) path.</description>

      <title>Power System State Estimation by Phase Synchronization and Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To estimate accurate voltage phasors from inaccurate voltage magnitude and complex power measurements, the standard approach is to iteratively refine a good initial guess using the Gauss-Newton method. But the nonconvexity of the estimation makes the Gauss-Newton method sensitive to its initial guess, so human intervention is needed to detect convergence to plausible but ultimately spurious estimates. This paper makes a novel connection between the angle estimation subproblem and phase synchronization to yield two key benefits: (1) an exceptionally high quality initial guess over the angles, known as a spectral initialization; (2) a correctness guarantee for the estimated angles, known as a global optimality certificate. These are formulated as sparse eigenvalue-eigenvector problems, which we efficiently compute in time comparable to a few Gauss-Newton iterations. Our experiments on the complete set of Polish, PEGASE, and RTE models show, where voltage magnitudes are already reasonably accurate, that spectral initialization provides an almost-perfect single-shot estimation of $n$ angles from $2n$ moderately noisy bus power measurements (i.e. $n$ pairs of PQ measurements), whose correctness becomes guaranteed after a single Gauss--Newton iteration. For less accurate voltage magnitudes, the performance of the method degrades gracefully; even with moderate voltage magnitude errors, the estimated voltage angles remain surprisingly accurate.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations on the capacity of distribution feeders and transformers within the electric grid at California State University Northridge (CSUN). With the increasing adoption of both residential and commercial EVs and the rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure, it is critical to evaluate the potential overloading effects of intensive EV charging on power distribution systems. This research assesses the impact of EV charging on the operation of CSUN's electric grid, identifying potential overload risks under projected EV adoption scenarios. Detailed simulations and analyses are conducted to quantify the extent of these impacts, focusing on various levels of EV penetration and charging patterns. The study also explores the impact of distributed generation on reducing the stress incurred by EV loads. The findings provide essential insights for utility companies, highlighting the need for strategic upgrades to distribution systems. These insights will help in developing robust strategies for both current operations and future planning to accommodate growing EV charging demands, ensuring grid stability and reliability in the face of increasing electrification of the transportation sector. The modeled CSUN electric grid can be used as a benchmark to study the impact of EV loads in dense areas on various parameters of the grid.</description>

      <title>On Convergent Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its Equivalence with Occupation Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new technique for norm-convergent dynamic mode decomposition of deterministic systems. The developed method utilizes recent results on singular dynamic mode decomposition where it is shown that by appropriate selection of domain and range Hilbert spaces, the Liouville operator (also known as the Koopman generator) can be made to be compact. In this paper, it is shown that by selecting appropriate collections of finite basis functions in the domain and the range, a novel finite-rank representation of the Liouville operator may be obtained. It is also shown that the model resulting from dynamic mode decomposition of the finite-rank representation is closely related to regularized regression using the so-called occupation kernels as basis functions.</description>

      <title>SplitVAEs: Decentralized scenario generation from siloed data for stochastic optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization problems in large-scale multi-stakeholder networked systems (e.g., power grids and supply chains) rely on data-driven scenarios to encapsulate complex spatiotemporal interdependencies. However, centralized aggregation of stakeholder data is challenging due to the existence of data silos resulting from computational and logistical bottlenecks. In this paper, we present SplitVAEs, a decentralized scenario generation framework that leverages variational autoencoders to generate high-quality scenarios without moving stakeholder data. With the help of experiments on distributed memory systems, we demonstrate the broad applicability of SplitVAEs in a variety of domain areas that are dominated by a large number of stakeholders. Our experiments indicate that SplitVAEs can learn spatial and temporal interdependencies in large-scale networks to generate scenarios that match the joint historical distribution of stakeholder data in a decentralized manner. Our experiments show that SplitVAEs deliver robust performance compared to centralized, state-of-the-art benchmark methods while significantly reducing data transmission costs, leading to a scalable, privacy-enhancing alternative to scenario generation.</description>

      <title>Wing Optimisation for a tractor propeller driven Micro Aerial Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes an investigation of the possible benefits from wing optimisation in improving the performance of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). As an example we study the Avion (3.64 kg mass, 1.60 m span), being designed at the CSIR National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru. The optimisation is first carried out using the methodology described by Rakshith \emph{et al.} (using an in\textendash house software PROWING), developed for large transport aircraft, with certain modifications to adapt the code to the special features of the MAV. The chief among such features is the use of low Reynolds number aerofoils with significantly different aerodynamic characteristics on a small MAV. These characteristics are taken from test data when available, and/or estimated by the XFOIL code of Drela. A total of 8 optimisation cases are studied for the purpose, leading to 6 different options for new wing planforms (and associated twist distributions along the wing span) with an improved performance. It is found that the improvements in drag coefficient using the PROWING code are about 5%. However, by allowing the operating lift coefficient $C_L$ to float within a specified range, drag bucket characteristics of the Eppler E423 aerofoil used on Avion can be exploited to improve the endurance, which is a major performance parameter for Avion. Thus, compared to the control wing $W_0$ (with operating point at $C_L$ =0.7) used in the preliminary design, permitting a variation of $C_L$ over a range of $\pm$ 10% is shown to enhance the endurance of wing $W_4$ by 18.6%, and of wing $W_{6}$ with a permitted $C_L$ range of $\pm$ 50% by 39.2%. Apart from the philosophy of seeking optimal operating conditions for a given configuration, the advantages of optimising design parameters such as washout of a simple wing proposed in the preliminary design stage, is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Iteratively Regularized Gauss-Newton Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on developing and motivating a stochastic version of a wellknown inverse problem methodology. Specifically, we consider the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method, originally proposed by Bakushinskii for infinite-dimensional problems. Recent work have extended this method to handle sequential observations, rather than a single instance of the data, demonstrating notable improvements in reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we further extend these methods to a stochastic framework through mini-batching, introducing a new algorithm, the stochastic iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (SIRGNM). Our algorithm is designed through the use randomized sketching. We provide an analysis for the SIRGNM, which includes a preliminary error decomposition and a convergence analysis, related to the residuals. We provide numerical experiments on a 2D elliptic PDE example. This illustrates the effectiveness of the SIRGNM, through maintaining a similar level of accuracy while reducing on the computational time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ConvexECG, an explainable and resource-efficient method for reconstructing six-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) from single-lead data, aimed at advancing personalized and continuous cardiac monitoring. ConvexECG leverages a convex reformulation of a two-layer ReLU neural network, enabling the potential for efficient training and deployment in resource constrained environments, while also having deterministic and explainable behavior. Using data from 25 patients, we demonstrate that ConvexECG achieves accuracy comparable to larger neural networks while significantly reducing computational overhead, highlighting its potential for real-time, low-resource monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear conjugate gradient methods: worst-case convergence rates via computer-assisted analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01530v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computer-assisted approach to the analysis of the worst-case convergence of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods (NCGMs). Those methods are known for their generally good empirical performances for large-scale optimization, while having relatively incomplete analyses. Using our computer-assisted approach, we establish novel complexity bounds for the Polak-Ribi\`ere-Polyak (PRP) and the Fletcher-Reeves (FR) NCGMs for smooth strongly convex minimization. In particular, we construct mathematical proofs that establish the first non-asymptotic convergence bound for FR (which is historically the first developed NCGM), and a much improved non-asymptotic convergence bound for PRP. Additionally, we provide simple adversarial examples on which these methods do not perform better than gradient descent with exact line search, leaving very little room for improvements on the same class of problems.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Learning for the Linear Quadratic Regulator over Rate-Limited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem being solved in a model-free manner using the policy gradient approach. If the gradient of the quadratic cost is being transmitted across a rate-limited channel, both the convergence and the rate of convergence of the resulting controller may be affected by the bit-rate permitted by the channel. We first pose this problem in a communication-constrained optimization framework and propose a new adaptive quantization algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (AQGD). This algorithm guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with no deterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting, above a certain finite threshold bit-rate allowed by the communication channel. We then propose a variant of AQGD that provides similar performance guarantees when applied to solve the model-free LQR problem. Our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the literature on compressed optimization. Our work also marks a first step towards a more general bridge between the fields of model-free control design and networked control systems.</description>

      <title>Optimality conditions for sparse optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with logarithmic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the optimal control of a parabolic initial-boundary value problem of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type with zero Neumann boundary conditions. Phase field systems of this type govern the evolution of diffusive phase transition processes with conserved order parameter. It is assumed that the nonlinear functions driving the physical processes within the spatial domain are double-well potentials of logarithmic type whose derivatives become singular at the boundary of their respective domains of definition. For such systems, optimal control problems have been studied in the past. We focus here on the situation when the cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a nondifferentiable term like the L1-norm, which leads to sparsity of optimal controls. For such cases, we establish first-order necessary and second-order sufficient optimality conditions for locally optimal controls. In the approach to second-order sufficient conditions, the main novelty of this paper, we adapt a technique introduced by E. Casas, C. Ryll and F. Tr\"oltzsch in the paper [SIAM J. Control Optim. 53 (2015), 2168-2202]. In this paper, we show that this method can also be successfully applied to systems of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type with logarithmic nonlinearity. Since the Cahn-Hilliard system corresponds to a fourth-order partial differential equation in contrast to the second-order systems investigated before, additional technical difficulties have to be overcome.</description>

      <title>Consensus Planning with Primal, Dual, and Proximal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus planning is a method for coordinating decision making across complex systems and organizations, including complex supply chain optimization pipelines. It arises when large interdependent distributed agents (systems) share common resources and must act in order to achieve a joint goal. In prior consensus planning work, all agents have been assumed to have the same interaction pattern (e.g., all dual agents or all primal agents or all proximal agents), most commonly using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as proximal agents. However, this is often not a valid assumption in practice, where agents consist of large complex systems, and where we might not have the luxury of modifying these large complex systems at will. In this paper, we introduce a consensus algorithm that overcomes this hurdle by allowing for the coordination of agents with different types of interfaces (named primal, dual, and proximal). Our consensus planning algorithm allows for any mix of agents by combining ADMM-like updates for the proximal agents, dual ascent updates for the dual agents, and linearized ADMM updates for the primal agents. We prove convergence results for the algorithm, namely a sublinear O(1/k) convergence rate under mild assumptions, and two-step linear convergence under stronger assumptions. We also discuss enhancements to the basic method and provide illustrative empirical results.</description>

      <title>A kernel-based PEM estimator for forward models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning the impulse responses characterizing forward models by means of a regularized kernel-based Prediction Error Method (PEM). The common approach to accomplish that is to approximate the system with a high-order stable ARX model. However, such choice induces a certain undesired prior information in the system that we want to estimate. To overcome this issue, we propose a new kernel-based paradigm which is formulated directly in terms of the impulse responses of the forward model and leading to the identification of a high-order MAX model. The most challenging step is the estimation of the kernel hyperparameters optimizing the marginal likelihood. The latter, indeed, does not admit a closed form expression. We propose a method for evaluating the marginal likelihood which makes possible the hyperparameters estimation. Finally, some numerical results showing the effectiveness of the method are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenges of black box optimization arise due to imprecise responses and limited output information. This article describes new results on optimizing multivariable functions using an Order Oracle, which provides access only to the order between function values and with some small errors. We obtained convergence rate estimates for the one-dimensional search method (golden ratio method) under the condition of oracle inaccuracy, as well as convergence results for the algorithm on a "square" (also with noise), which outperforms its alternatives. The results obtained are similar to those in problems with oracles providing significantly more information about the optimized function. Additionally, the practical application of the algorithm has been demonstrated in maximizing a preference function, where the parameters are the acidity and sweetness of the drink. This function is expected to be convex or at least quasi-convex.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Nash Equilibrium over Variational Equilibria via Fixed-point Set Expression of Quasi-nonexpansive Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium selection problem in the generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) has recently been studied as an optimization problem, defined over the set of all variational equilibria achievable first through a non-cooperative game among players. However, to make such a selection fairly for all players, we have to rely on an unrealistic assumption, that is, the availability of a reliable center not possible to cause any bias for all players. In this paper, we propose a new equilibrium selection achievable by solving a further GNEP, named the hierarchical Nash equilibrium problem (HNEP), within only the players. The HNEP covers existing optimization-based equilibrium selections as its simplest cases, while the general style of the HNEP can ensure a fair equilibrium selection without assuming any trusted center or randomness. We also propose an iterative algorithm for the HNEP as an application of the hybrid steepest descent method to a variational inequality newly defined over the fixed point set of a quasi-nonexpansive operator. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed equilibrium selection via the HNEP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic traffic assignment model, where agents base their instantaneous routing decisions on real-time delay predictions. We formulate a mathematically concise model and define dynamic prediction equilibrium (DPE) in which no agent can at any point during their journey improve their predicted travel time by switching to a different route. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by showing that it subsumes the well-known full information and instantaneous information models, in addition to admitting further realistic predictors as special cases. We then proceed to derive properties of the predictors that ensure a dynamic prediction equilibrium exists. Additionally, we define $\varepsilon$-approximate DPE wherein no agent can improve their predicted travel time by more than $\varepsilon$ and provide further conditions of the predictors under which such an approximate equilibrium can be computed. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis by an experimental study, in which we systematically compare the induced average travel times of different predictors, including two machine-learning based models trained on data gained from previously computed approximate equilibrium flows, both on synthetic and real world road networks.</description>

Abstract: We study gradient drift-diffusion processes on a probability simplex set with finite state Wasserstein metrics, namely finite state Wasserstein common noises. A fact is that the Kolmogorov transition equation of finite reversible Markov processes satisfies the gradient flow of entropy in finite state Wasserstein space. This paper proposes to perturb finite state Markov processes with Wasserstein common noises. In this way, we introduce a class of stochastic reversible Markov processes. We also define stochastic transition rate matrices, namely Wasserstein Q-matrices, for the proposed stochastic Markov processes. We then derive the functional Fokker-Planck equation in the probability simplex, whose stationary distribution is a Gibbs distribution of entropy functional in a simplex set. Several examples of Wasserstein drift-diffusion processes on a two-point state space are presented.</description>

Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic type of Keller-Segel equations with generalized diffusion and logistic source under homogeneous Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions. We construct bounded weak solutions globally in time in an unbalanced optimal transport framework, provided that the magnitude of the chemotactic sensitivity can be restricted depending on parameters. In the case of subquadratic degradation of the logistic source, we quantify the chemotactic sensitivity, in particular, in terms of the power of degradation and the pointwise bound of the initial density.</description>

      <title>Meshfree Variational Physics Informed Neural Networks (MF-VPINN): an adaptive training strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Meshfree Variational-Physics-Informed Neural Network. It is a Variational-Physics-Informed Neural Network that does not require the generation of the triangulation of the entire domain and that can be trained with an adaptive set of test functions. In order to generate the test space, we exploit an a posteriori error indicator and add test functions only where the error is higher. Four training strategies are proposed and compared. Numerical results show that the accuracy is higher than the one of a Variational-Physics-Informed Neural Network trained with the same number of test functions but defined on a quasi-uniform mesh.</description>
