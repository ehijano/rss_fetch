      <title>Block-Transitive Automorphism Groups of $2$-$(v,5,\lambda)$ Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates $2$-$(v,5,\lambda)$ designs $\mathcal{D}$ admitting a block-transitive automorphism group $G$. We first prove that if $G$ is point-imprimitive, then $v$ must be one of 16, 21, or 81. We further provide a complete classification of all such designs for $v=16$ and $v=21$. Secondly, we demonstrate that if $G$ is point-primitive, then it must be of affine type, almost simple type, or product type. Additionally, we present a classification of pairs $(\mathcal{D},G)$ where $G$ is of product type.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ measure equivalence of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify compactly generated locally compact groups of polynomial growth up to $L^p$ measure equivalence (ME) for all $p\leq 1$.
  To achieve this, we combine rigidity results (previously proved for discrete groups by Bowen and Austin) with new constructions of explicit orbit equivalences between simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. In particular, we prove that for every pair of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups there is an $L^p$ orbit equivalence for some $p&gt;0$, where we can choose $p&gt;1$ if and only if the groups have isomorphic asymptotic cones. We also prove analogous results for lattices in simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. This yields a strong converse of Austin's Theorem that two nilpotent groups which are $L^1$ ME have isomorphic Carnot graded groups.
  We also address the much harder problem of extending this classification to $L^p$ ME for $p&gt;1$: we obtain the first rigidity results, providing examples of nilpotent groups with isomorphic Carnot graded groups (hence $L^1$ OE) which are not $L^p$ ME for some finite (explicit) $p$. For this we introduce a new technique, which consists of combining induction of cohomology and scaling limits via the use of a theorem of Cantrell.
  Finally, in the appendix, we extend theorems of Bowen, Austin and Cantrell on $L^1$ ME to locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>Virtual retractions in free constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ has property (VRC) if every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract. This property is stable under many standard group-theoretic constructions and is enjoyed by all virtually special groups (in the sense of Haglund and Wise). In this paper we study property (VRC) for fundamental groups of finite graphs of groups.
  Our main criterion shows that the fundamental group of a finite graph of finitely generated virtually abelian groups has (VRC) if and only if it has a homomorphism to a Euclidean-by-finite group that is injective on all vertex groups. This result allows us to determine property (VRC) for such groups using basic tools from Euclidean Geometry and Linear Algebra. We use it to produce examples and to give sufficient criteria for fundamental groups of finite graphs of finitely generated abelian groups with cyclic edge groups to have (VRC).
  In the last two sections and in the appendix we give applications of property (VRC). We show that if a fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with finitely generated virtually abelian vertex groups has (VRC) then it is CAT($0$). We also show that tubular groups with (VRC) are virtually free-by-cyclic and virtually special.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Realizability of fusion systems by discrete groups: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare four different types of realizability for saturated fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups. For example, when $G$ is a locally finite group all of whose $p$-subgroups are artinian (hence discrete $p$-toral), we show that it has ``weakly Sylow'' $p$-subgroups and give explicit constructions of saturated fusion systems and associated linking systems associated to $G$. We also show that a fusion system over a discrete $p$-toral group $S$ is saturated if its set of morphisms is closed under a certain topology and the finite subgroups of $S$ satisfy the saturation axioms, and prove a version of the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements theorem for locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>Oligomorphic groups, categories of partial bijections, and ultrahomogeneous cubic spaces over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain class of oligomorphic groups there is a version of multiplication of double cosets in the Ismagilov--Olshanski sense. Categories of (reduced) double cosets are realized as certain categories of partial bijections. As an example, we consider the ultrahomogeneous linear space $\mathcal{Z}$ of countable dimension over afinite field equipped with a cubic form. The group of automorphisms of $\mathcal{Z}$ is an oligomorphic group, we describe its open subgroups. According Tsankov, this gives a classification of its unitary representations. The category of reduced double cosets in this case is the category of partial linear bijections of finite-dimensional cubic spaces preserving cubic forms.</description>

      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. This conjecture has been proved for symmetric groups, hyperoctahedral groups, all right-angled Coxeter groups, and computationally verified for finite Coxeter groups of types $D_4$, $F_4$, $G_2$, and $H_3$. This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\widetilde{A}_2$, $\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from building theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying the convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving the strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations. Notably, for the case of affine type $\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof strategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type $\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate potential for generalization. Their possible algebraic reformulation may not only provide new perspectives for further investigation of this conjecture but also offer methodological insights for algebraic combinatorics and geometric group theory.</description>
