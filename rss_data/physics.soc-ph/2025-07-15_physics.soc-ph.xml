      <title>Advancing network resilience theories with symbolized reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes. Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas. This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses. Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy, significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.</description>

      <title>Analyzing mob dynamics in social media networks using epidemiology model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemiological models, traditionally used to study disease spread, can effectively analyze mob behavior on social media by treating ideas, sentiments, or behaviors as ``contagions" that propagate through user networks. In this research, we introduced a mathematical model to analyze social behavior related to COVID-19 spread by examining Twitter activity from April 2020 to June 2020. Our analysis focused on key terms such as ``lockdown" and ``quarantine" to track public sentiment and engagement trends during the pandemic. The threshold number $\Re_{0}$ is derived, and the stability of the steady states is established. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of applicable parameters are carried out. The results show that negative sentiment on Twitter has less influence on COVID-19 spread compared to positive sentiment. However, the effect of negative sentiment on the spread of COVID-19 remains remarkably strong. Moreover, we use the Caputo operator with different parameter values to study the impact of social media platforms on the transmission of COVID-19 diseases.</description>

      <title>FlowsDT: A Geospatial Digital Twin for Navigating Urban Flood Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communities worldwide increasingly confront flood hazards intensified by climate change, urban expansion, and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges requires real-time flood analysis, precise flood forecasting, and robust risk communications with stakeholders to implement efficient mitigation strategies. Recent advances in hydrodynamic modeling and digital twins afford new opportunities for high-resolution flood modeling and visualization at the street and basement levels. Focusing on Galveston City, a barrier island in Texas, U.S., this study created a geospatial digital twin (GDT) supported by 1D-2D coupled hydrodynamic models to strengthen urban resilience to pluvial and fluvial flooding. The objectives include: (1) developing a GDT (FlowsDT-Galveston) incorporating topography, hydrography, and infrastructure; (2) validating the twin using historical flood events and social sensing; (3) modeling hyperlocal flood conditions under 2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year return period rainfall scenarios; and (4) identifying at-risk zones under different scenarios. This study employs the PCSWMM to create dynamic virtual replicas of urban landscapes and accurate flood modeling. By integrating LiDAR data, land cover, and storm sewer geometries, the model can simulate flood depth, extent, duration, and velocity in a 4-D environment across different historical and design storms. Results show buildings inundated over one foot increased by 5.7% from 2- to 100-year flood. Road inundations above 1 foot increased by 6.7% from 2- to 100-year floods. The proposed model can support proactive flood management and urban planning in Galveston; and inform disaster resilience efforts and guide sustainable infrastructure development. The framework can be extended to other communities facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Understanding Rural Commuting Patterns and Transportation Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation provides access to employment opportunities and essential services such as healthcare services; while urban areas have various transportation options, the situation differs in rural areas. Rural residents often have longer commute distances, limited access to public transit, and extended waiting times for public transportation if they exist, which can significantly impact their access to vital services and job opportunities. This study used data from the 2017 NHTS survey to examine the commuting patterns in rural areas by utilizing multinomial logistic regression to determine how various factors impact the choice of mode of transport in rural areas. Findings from this study revealed a higher dependency, 92.1%, on using personal vehicles when making trips in rural areas. Multinomial logistic regression results showed that socio-demographics, household, and trip characteristics affect the mode of transport used in a trip. Older adults, females, and individuals with higher education levels than high school graduates are less likely to use public transit when making trips. For household characteristics, the availability of vehicles in a household and households with higher income levels have lower probabilities of making a trip using public transit. Longer trip distances reduce the likelihood of a trip using active commuting modes such as walking and biking. These findings provide insights into understanding the transportation behaviors in rural areas and provide knowledge to be used in the planning and developing transportation projects that promote equitable and accessible transportation in rural areas</description>

      <title>Network reciprocity turns cheap talk into a force for cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-binding communication is common in daily life and crucial for fostering cooperation, even though it has no direct payoff consequences. However, despite robust empirical evidence, its evolutionary basis remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a game-theoretic model in which individuals can signal an intention to cooperate before playing a Donation game. Strategies differ in how they respond to these signals, ranging from unconditional to conditional types, with the latter incurring a cognitive cost for deliberation. Through evolutionary analysis, we show that non-binding communication alone cannot sustain cooperation in well-mixed, anonymous populations, consistent with empirical observations. In contrast, structured populations support the emergence of cooperation, with conditional cooperators acting as catalysts that protect unconditional cooperators through context-dependent patterns of cyclic dominance. These findings offer an evolutionary explanation for how non-binding communication promotes cooperation and provide a modelling framework for exploring its effects in diverse social settings.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Multi-scaling Laws and Meta-Graph Reconstruction in Laplacian Renormalization of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08893v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) method in spectral space (SS) has recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional RG approaches in real space (RS) and momentum space (MS). Leveraging the intrinsic properties of random walks and diffusion, the SS RG framework is particularly effective in analyzing the structural and dynamical features of complex networks, serving as a valuable complement to RS and MS techniques. However, its theoretical foundation remains incomplete due to its time-dependent long-range coarse-graining mechanism. In this work, we construct a self-consistent framework in which the fractal, random walk, and degree exponents are determined simultaneously, while their scaling relations remain invariant. We also introduce a novel method for constructing meta-renormalized networks and discuss the roles of meta-links in a real electric power grid. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and non-recursive nature of the SS RG transformation.</description>

      <title>Greening Schoolyards and the Spatial Distribution of Property Values in Denver, Colorado</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schoolyard greening initiatives have become increasingly prominent in urban school districts across the United States, particularly as mechanisms to promote environmental justice, child well-being, and neighborhood revitalization. While these interventions aim to address health and ecological disparities, they may also trigger real estate speculation and displacement in historically marginalized areas. This study investigates how property values are affected by proximity to greened schoolyards in Denver, Colorado. Using spatial analysis and hedonic regression techniques, we examine whether these greening efforts correlate with uneven housing market changes across diverse neighborhoods. Results suggest that homes located within 250 meters of greened schoolyards experienced significantly higher value appreciation than those further away, especially in neighborhoods already undergoing gentrification. These findings raise questions about the unintended consequences of environmental investments and emphasize the need for equitable policy frameworks.</description>

      <title>Schoolyard Greening, Child Health, and Neighborhood Change: A Comparative Study of Urban U.S. Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Schoolyard greening has emerged as an innovative approach to enhancing childrens health and environmental equity in urban U.S. cities. Yet, the implications for neighborhood dynamics and social equity are insufficiently understood. Methods: This comparative literature review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative evidence from peer reviewed studies and case analyses of schoolyard greening in major U.S. cities. Results: Schoolyard greening consistently increases utilization and has a positive, though variable, effect on childrens physical activity and well-being. However, the benefits are not always equitably distributed, and greening projects can catalyze neighborhood change, sometimes leading to green gentrification. Conclusions: Greening urban schoolyards offers benefits for childrens health and urban sustainability but poses challenges for equity and social justice. Policies must prioritize inclusive, community driven approaches to ensure the gains of greening are shared by vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dynamics between language usage and economic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two centuries, the frequency of word usage in major Western languages has exhibited small amplitude regular cycles, superimposed on larger background trends. We show that these cycles of word usage organize into semantically coherent clusters that track, interact with, or precede macroeconomic rhythms. To explore the nature of this interaction, we build on a minimal mathematical model that captures usage dynamics through parameters linked to real world processes. Parameter fitting reveals that word usage operates near a Hopf bifurcation, a critical regime associated with heightened sensitivity, uncovering a robust and specific coupling between language usage and economic activity. In linguistic datasets that allow long term quantitative analysis, rooted in capitalist contexts, this coupling appears as an oscillatory dynamic, reflecting a feedback process in which language both shapes material reality and manages the changes it produces.</description>

      <title>Constructing the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow from large-scale vehicle trajectory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, researchers and practitioners typically measure macroscopic traffic flow variables, i.e., density, flow, and speed, using time or space cuts, and then construct the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow. With the advent of large-scale vehicle trajectory datasets, often capturing 100% of vehicle dynamics, Edie's generalized definitions have become widely recognized as the most appropriate framework for measuring these variables. However, while Edie's formulation explicitly requires the traffic state within the measurement region to be both stationary and homogeneous, there is little guidance on how to systematically identify such qualified regions and construct the corresponding fundamental diagrams. To address this gap, this paper proposes an Edie's definition-based method for measuring traffic variables and constructing the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow by automatically identifying stationary traffic states using parallelogram-shaped aggregation regions. An open-source tool is developed and released in https://github.com/gotrafficgo/construct_fundamental_diagram to support both researchers and practitioners. From now on, we have an automated tool that can generate fundamental diagrams directly from any large-scale time-space diagram of vehicle trajectories, either collected from the real world or generated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Epidemic spread: limiting contacts to regular circles is not necessarily the safest option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a new infectious disease (or a new strain of an existing one) emerges, as in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, different types of mobility restrictions are considered to slow down or mitigate the spread of the disease. The measures to be adopted require carefully weighing the social cost against their impact on disease control. In this work, we analyze, in a context of mobility restrictions, the role of frequent versus occasional contacts in epidemic spread. We develop an individual-based mathematical model where frequent contacts among individuals (at home, work, schools) and occasional contacts (at stores, transport, etc.) are considered. We define several contact structures by changing the relative weight between frequent and occasional contacts while keeping the same initial effective rate of spread. We find the remarkable result that the more frequent contacts prevail over occasional ones, the higher the epidemic peak, the sooner it occurs, and the greater the final number of individuals affected by the epidemic. We conduct our study using an SIR model, considering both exponential and deterministic recovery from infection, and obtain that this effect is more pronounced under deterministic recovery. We find that the impact of relaxation measures depends on the relative importance of frequent and occasional contacts within the considered social structures. Finally, we assess in which of the considered scenarios the homogeneous mixing approximation provides a reasonable description of the epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Last Birth: A Game-Theoretical Resolution to the Human Sex Ratio Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of offspring sex ratios using a game-theoretical model in which the decision to have another child depends on the sex of the previous child. Motivated by higher male infant mortality and the tendency to try again after a child's death, our model allows different continuation probabilities after sons and daughters. We find that a stable sex ratio at birth (SRB) differing from 1:1 can arise when these continuation probabilities differ. However, the sex ratio among last-born children (SRLB) always converges to 1:1. We mathematically prove that this 1:1 SRLB is an evolutionarily stable strategy under a new fitness measure based on the number of offspring in successful mating pairs, rather than the number of descendants in the whole population. Our results generalize Fisher's principle by showing that equilibrium is maintained at the level of last births even when the overall SRB is biased. This offers a potential explanation for the persistent slight male bias in human births, linking it to sex-specific child mortality and parental reproductive strategies in historical populations.</description>

      <title>Properties of Quasi-synchronization Time of High-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of one-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause (HK) dynamics driven by noise has been extensively studied. Previous research has indicated that within no matter the bounded or the unbounded space of one dimension, the HK dynamics attain quasi-synchronization (synchronization in noisy case) in finite time. However, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon holds in high-dimensional space. This paper investigates the random time for quasi-synchronization of multi-dimensional HK model and reveals that the boundedness and dimensions of the space determine different outcomes. To be specific, if the space is bounded, quasi-synchronization can be attained almost surely for all dimensions within a finite time, whereas in unbounded space, quasi-synchronization can only be achieved in low-dimensional cases (one and two). Furthermore, different integrability of the random time of various cases is proved.</description>

      <title>Mapping Crisis-Driven Market Dynamics: A Transfer Entropy and Kramers-Moyal Approach to Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are dynamic, interconnected systems where local shocks can trigger widespread instability, challenging portfolio managers and policymakers. Traditional correlation analysis often miss the directionality and temporal dynamics of information flow. To address this, we present a unified framework integrating Transfer Entropy (TE) and the N-dimensional Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion to map static and time-resolved coupling among four major indices: Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), WTI crude oil (WTI), gold (GC=F), and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB). TE captures directional information flow. KM models non-linear stochastic dynamics, revealing interactions often overlooked by linear methods. Using daily data from August 11, 2014, to September 8, 2024, we compute returns, confirm non-stationary using a conduct sliding-window TE and KM analyses. We find that during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the Russia-Ukraine crisis (Feb-Apr 2022), average TE increases by 35% and 28%, respectively, indicating heightened directional flow. Drift coefficients highlight gold-dollar interactions as a persistent safe-haven channel, while oil-equity linkages show regime shifts, weakening under stress and rebounding quickly. Our results expose the shortcomings of linear measures and underscore the value of combining information-theoretic and stochastic drift methods. This approach offers actionable insights for adaptive hedging and informs macro-prudential policy by revealing the evolving architecture of systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of real-time astronomy, citizen scientists play an increasingly important role in the discovery and follow-up of transient astrophysical phenomena. From local astronomical societies to global initiatives, amateur astronomers contribute valuable observational data that complement professional efforts. Astro-COLIBRI facilitates these contributions by providing a user-friendly platform that integrates real-time alerts, data visualization tools, and collaborative features to support astronomers at all levels.
  The Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program provides engagement opportunities across multiple scales. At the grassroots level, we collaborate with local astronomy clubs, equipping them with accessible tools for transient event monitoring. National and international networks, such as RAPAS in France, leverage Astro-COLIBRI's real-time capabilities for coordinated observations. On a global scale, we actively participate in high-impact citizen science and capacity building initiatives, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Citizen Science Program and the "Open Universe" initiative led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). These collaborations enhance the accessibility of real-time astrophysical data and foster inclusive participation in cutting-edge astronomy.
  In this contribution, we will present the Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program, highlighting its technical framework, community impact, and case studies of successful amateur contributions. We will showcase how our platform facilitates the rapid exchange of information between professional and amateur astronomers, democratizing access to multi-messenger astrophysics and enabling the global community to contribute meaningfully to time-domain discoveries.</description>

      <title>Introduction to correlation networks: Interdisciplinary approaches beyond thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many empirical networks originate from correlational data, arising in domains as diverse as psychology, neuroscience, genomics, microbiology, finance, and climate science. Specialized algorithms and theory have been developed in different application domains for working with such networks, as well as in statistics, network science, and computer science, often with limited communication between practitioners in different fields. This leaves significant room for cross-pollination across disciplines. A central challenge is that it is not always clear how to best transform correlation matrix data into networks for the application at hand, and probably the most widespread method, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value to create either unweighted or weighted networks, suffers from multiple problems. In this article, we review various methods of constructing and analyzing correlation networks, ranging from thresholding and its improvements to weighted networks, regularization, dynamic correlation networks, threshold-free approaches, comparison with null models, and more. Finally, we propose and discuss recommended practices and a variety of key open questions currently confronting this field.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understanding modern-day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemics spreading through society. However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.</description>

      <title>Goal assembly as a formalism of evolvable design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, a unified understanding of technology and biology is critically needed but still lacking. A cornerstone of such unification is evolvable design. I present a formalism, called goal assembly, that unifies three key characteristics of evolvable, biology-like design: (i) hierarchical integration of small competencies into larger competencies; (ii) highly non-uniform (power-law or log-normal distributed) representation of phenotypes by genotypes; and (iii) evolution of hierarchical modularity. It does so by making the hierarchy of physical goal states corresponding to substructures explicit, focusing on their composition across scales. In particular, higher-level goal variables approximate achievable joint goal states of interacting lower-level goal variables. Mechanisms of evolvability include goal state gradient backpropagation across scales, hierarchical decision making among alternative goal states, and structural recombination of modules. In learning theory terms, goal assembly proposes architectural inductive biases of emergent engineering systems operating at a complexity regime where goals arise as necessary abstractions. Beyond asking what goals are and how they are achieved, goal assembly suggests we can almost independently talk about their compositionality.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics commonly used to analyze partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). Our main results compare, for combinations of seats and votes achievable in districted elections, the number of districts won by each party to the extent of potential deviation from the ideal metric values, taking into account the political geography of the state. These comparisons are motivated by examples where the MM and PB have been used in efforts to detect when a districting plan awards extreme number of districts won by some party. These examples include expert testimony, public-facing apps, recommendations by experts to redistricting commissions, and public policy proposals. To achieve this goal we perform both theoretical and empirical analyses of the MM and PB. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V, S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of (V,S) pairs that achieve MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to vary. By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we can show that the values taken on by these metrics do not necessarily attain more extreme values in plans with more extreme numbers of districts won. We also analyze specific example elections, showing how these metrics can return unintuitive results. We follow this with an empirical study, where we show that on 18 different U.S. maps these metrics can fail to detect extreme seats outcomes.</description>

      <title>Most Swiss-system tournaments are unfair: Evidence from chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Swiss-system is an increasingly popular tournament format as it provides an attractive trade-off between the number of matches and ranking accuracy. However, few research consider the optimal design of Swiss-system tournaments. We contribute to this topic by empirically investigating the fairness of 52 Swiss-system chess competitions containing an odd (9 or 11) number of rounds, where about half of the players have an extra game with the white pieces. It is verified that they often enjoy a significant advantage: they are expected to score more points and have higher chances of performing above certain thresholds. A potential solution could be to organise Swiss-system tournaments with an even number of rounds and guarantee a balanced colour assignment for all players using a recently proposed pairing mechanism.</description>
