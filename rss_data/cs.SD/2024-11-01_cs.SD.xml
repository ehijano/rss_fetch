      <title>Neurobench: DCASE 2020 Acoustic Scene Classification benchmark on XyloAudio 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XyloAudio is a line of ultra-low-power audio inference chips, designed for in- and near-microphone analysis of audio in real-time energy-constrained scenarios. Xylo is designed around a highly efficient integer-logic processor which simulates parameter- and activity-sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) using a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. Neurons on Xylo are quantised integer devices operating in synchronous digital CMOS, with neuron and synapse state quantised to 16 bit, and weight parameters quantised to 8 bit. Xylo is tailored for real-time streaming operation, as opposed to accelerated-time operation in the case of an inference accelerator. XyloAudio includes a low-power audio encoding interface for direct connection to a microphone, designed for sparse encoding of incident audio for further processing by the inference core. In this report we present the results of DCASE 2020 acoustic scene classification audio benchmark dataset deployed to XyloAudio 2. We describe the benchmark dataset; the audio preprocessing approach; and the network architecture and training approach. We present the performance of the trained model, and the results of power and latency measurements performed on the XyloAudio 2 development kit. This benchmark is conducted as part of the Neurobench project.</description>

      <title>Improving snore detection under limited dataset through harmonic/percussive source separation and convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snoring, an acoustic biomarker commonly observed in individuals with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), holds significant potential for diagnosing and monitoring this recognized clinical disorder. Irrespective of snoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns manifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we propose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring sounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using harmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature, based on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for conventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection performance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a large dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced training set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former scenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared to other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the proposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram derived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular scenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the performance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical input features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly demonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning of the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most snoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.</description>

      <title>The NPU-HWC System for the ISCSLP 2024 Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the NPU-HWC system submitted to the ISCSLP 2024 Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024 (ICAGC). Our system consists of two modules: a speech generator for Track 1 and a background audio generator for Track 2. In Track 1, we employ Single-Codec to tokenize the speech into discrete tokens and use a language-model-based approach to achieve zero-shot speaking style cloning. The Single-Codec effectively decouples timbre and speaking style at the token level, reducing the acoustic modeling burden on the autoregressive language model. Additionally, we use DSPGAN to upsample 16 kHz mel-spectrograms to high-fidelity 48 kHz waveforms. In Track 2, we propose a background audio generator based on large language models (LLMs). This system produces scene-appropriate accompaniment descriptions, synthesizes background audio with Tango 2, and integrates it with the speech generated by our Track 1 system. Our submission achieves the second place and the first place in Track 1 and Track 2 respectively.</description>

      <title>DDMD: AI-Powered Digital Drug Music Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first version of DDMD (Digital Drug Music Detector), a binary classifier that distinguishes digital drug music from normal music. In the literature, digital drug music is primarily explored regarding its psychological, neurological, or social impact. However, despite numerous studies on using machine learning in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), including music genre classification, digital drug music has not been considered in this field. In this study, we initially collected a dataset of 3,176 audio files divided into two classes (1,676 digital drugs and 1,500 non-digital drugs). We extracted machine learning features, including MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast, and frequency analysis metrics (mean and standard deviation of detected frequencies). Using a Random Forest classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 93%. Finally, we developed a web application to deploy the model, enabling end users to detect digital drug music.</description>

      <title>Lina-Speech: Gated Linear Attention is a Fast and Parameter-Efficient Learner for text-to-speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural codec language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, leveraging scalable architectures like autoregressive transformers and large-scale speech datasets. By framing voice cloning as a prompt continuation task, these models excel at cloning voices from short audio samples. However, this approach is limited in its ability to handle numerous or lengthy speech excerpts, since the concatenation of source and target speech must fall within the maximum context length which is determined during training. In this work, we introduce Lina-Speech, a model that replaces traditional self-attention mechanisms with emerging recurrent architectures like Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Building on the success of initial-state tuning on RWKV, we extend this technique to voice cloning, enabling the use of multiple speech samples and full utilization of the context window in synthesis. This approach is fast, easy to deploy, and achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned baselines when the dataset size ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Notably, Lina-Speech matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, including some with a parameter count up to four times higher or trained in an end-to-end style. We release our code and checkpoints. Audio samples are available at https://theodorblackbird.github.io/blog/demo_lina/.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Vocal Education: Technical Evaluation of Limited Samples Describing Mezzo-soprano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vocal education in the music field is difficult to quantify due to the individual differences in singers' voices and the different quantitative criteria of singing techniques. Deep learning has great potential to be applied in music education due to its efficiency to handle complex data and perform quantitative analysis. However, accurate evaluations with limited samples over rare vocal types, such as Mezzo-soprano, requires extensive well-annotated data support using deep learning models. In order to attain the objective, we perform transfer learning by employing deep learning models pre-trained on the ImageNet and Urbansound8k datasets for the improvement on the precision of vocal technique evaluation. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of the lack of samples by constructing a dedicated dataset, the Mezzo-soprano Vocal Set (MVS), for vocal technique assessment. Our experimental results indicate that transfer learning increases the overall accuracy (OAcc) of all models by an average of 8.3%, with the highest accuracy at 94.2%. We not only provide a novel approach to evaluating Mezzo-soprano vocal techniques but also introduce a new quantitative assessment method for music education.</description>

      <title>Audio Is the Achilles' Heel: Red Teaming Audio Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated the ability to interact with humans under real-world conditions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and modality encoders to align multimodal information (visual and auditory) with text. However, such models raise new safety challenges of whether models that are safety-aligned on text also exhibit consistent safeguards for multimodal inputs. Despite recent safety-alignment research on vision LMMs, the safety of audio LMMs remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively red team the safety of five advanced audio LMMs under three settings: (i) harmful questions in both audio and text formats, (ii) harmful questions in text format accompanied by distracting non-speech audio, and (iii) speech-specific jailbreaks. Our results under these settings demonstrate that open-source audio LMMs suffer an average attack success rate of 69.14% on harmful audio questions, and exhibit safety vulnerabilities when distracted with non-speech audio noise. Our speech-specific jailbreaks on Gemini-1.5-Pro achieve an attack success rate of 70.67% on the harmful query benchmark. We provide insights on what could cause these reported safety-misalignments.

      <title>Task-Aware Unified Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several attempts have been made to handle multiple source separation tasks such as speech enhancement, speech separation, sound event separation, music source separation (MSS), or cinematic audio source separation (CASS) with a single model. These models are trained on large-scale data including speech, instruments, or sound events and can often successfully separate a wide range of sources. However, it is still challenging for such models to cover all separation tasks because some of them are contradictory (e.g., musical instruments are separated in MSS while they have to be grouped in CASS). To overcome this issue and support all the major separation tasks, we propose a task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model. The model uses a variable number of learnable prompts to specify which source to separate, and changes its behavior depending on the given prompts, enabling it to handle all the major separation tasks including contradictory ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TUSS model successfully handles the five major separation tasks mentioned earlier. We also provide some audio examples, including both synthetic mixtures and real recordings, to demonstrate how flexibly the TUSS model changes its behavior at inference depending on the prompts.</description>

      <title>Speech is More Than Words: Do Speech-to-Text Translation Systems Leverage Prosody?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prosody of a spoken utterance, including features like stress, intonation and rhythm, can significantly affect the underlying semantics, and as a consequence can also affect its textual translation. Nevertheless, prosody is rarely studied within the context of speech-to-text translation (S2TT) systems. In particular, end-to-end (E2E) systems have been proposed as well-suited for prosody-aware translation because they have direct access to the speech signal when making translation decisions, but the understanding of whether this is successful in practice is still limited. A main challenge is the difficulty of evaluating prosody awareness in translation. To address this challenge, we introduce an evaluation methodology and a focused benchmark (named ContraProST) aimed at capturing a wide range of prosodic phenomena. Our methodology uses large language models and controllable text-to-speech (TTS) to generate contrastive examples. Through experiments in translating English speech into German, Spanish, and Japanese, we find that (a) S2TT models possess some internal representation of prosody, but the prosody signal is often not strong enough to affect the translations, (b) E2E systems outperform cascades of speech recognition and text translation systems, confirming their theoretical advantage in this regard, and (c) certain cascaded systems also capture prosodic information in the translation, but only to a lesser extent that depends on the particulars of the transcript's surface form.</description>

      <title>DC-Spin: A Speaker-invariant Speech Tokenizer for Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have gained increasing attention with advancements in text-based, decoder-only language models. SLMs process text and speech, enabling simultaneous speech understanding and generation. This paper presents Double-Codebook Speaker-invariant Clustering (DC-Spin), which aims to improve speech tokenization by bridging audio signals and SLM tokens. DC-Spin extracts speaker-invariant tokens rich in phonetic information and resilient to input variations, enhancing zero-shot SLM tasks and speech resynthesis. We propose a chunk-wise approach to enable streamable DC-Spin without retraining and degradation. Comparisons of tokenization methods (self-supervised and neural audio codecs), model scalability, and downstream task proxies show that tokens easily modeled by an n-gram LM or aligned with phonemes offer strong performance, providing insights for designing speech tokenizers for SLMs.</description>

      <title>SongCreator: Lyrics-based Universal Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music is an integral part of human culture, embodying human intelligence and creativity, of which songs compose an essential part. While various aspects of song generation have been explored by previous works, such as singing voice, vocal composition and instrumental arrangement, etc., generating songs with both vocals and accompaniment given lyrics remains a significant challenge, hindering the application of music generation models in the real world. In this light, we propose SongCreator, a song-generation system designed to tackle this challenge. The model features two novel designs: a meticulously designed dual-sequence language model (DSLM) to capture the information of vocals and accompaniment for song generation, and a series of attention mask strategies for DSLM, which allows our model to understand, generate and edit songs, making it suitable for various songrelated generation tasks by utilizing specific attention masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SongCreator by achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performances on all eight tasks. Notably, it surpasses previous works by a large margin in lyrics-to-song and lyrics-to-vocals. Additionally, it is able to independently control the acoustic conditions of the vocals and accompaniment in the generated song through different audio prompts, exhibiting its potential applicability. Our samples are available at https://thuhcsi.github.io/SongCreator/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a speech-conditioned Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based connector to address the challenge of Code-Switching (CS) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Specifically, we propose an Insertion and Deletion of Interruption Token (IDIT) mechanism for better transfer text generation ability of LLM to speech recognition task. We also present a connecter with MoE architecture that manages multiple languages efficiently. To further enhance the collaboration of multiple experts and leverage the understanding capabilities of LLM, we propose a two-stage progressive training strategy: 1) The connector is unfrozen and trained with language-specialized experts to map speech representations to the text space. 2) The connector and LLM LoRA adaptor are trained with the proposed IDIT mechanism and all experts are activated to learn general representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including end-to-end and large-scale audio-language models.</description>

      <title>FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts. We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for the speech enhancement task. We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space. This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model. The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline. Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

      <title>TransVIP: Speech to Speech Translation System with Voice and Isochrony Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data. In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker's voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.</description>

      <title>Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. This paper presents a comprehensive review of three interconnected digital aquaculture tasks, namely, fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis, using a novel and unified approach. Unlike previous reviews which focused on single modalities or individual tasks, we analyse vision-based (i.e. image- and video-based), acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods across all three tasks. We examine their advantages, limitations, and applications, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical cross-cutting research gaps. The review also includes emerging ideas such as applying multi-task learning and large language models to address various aspects of fish monitoring, an approach not previously explored in aquaculture literature. We identify the major obstacles hindering research progress in this field, including the scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards. To overcome the current limitations, we explore the potential of using emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning to improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of integrated fish monitoring systems. In addition, we provide a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. This holistic perspective offers a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and to promote their practical implementations in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Physical Modeling of Planar String Sound and Motion Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant advancements have been made in music generation and differentiable sound synthesis within machine learning and computer audition, the simulation of instrument vibration guided by physical laws has been underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating the spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis and spectral modeling within a neural network framework. Our model leverages physical properties and fundamental frequencies as inputs, outputting string states across time and space that solve the partial differential equation characterizing the nonlinear string. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves superior accuracy in string motion simulation compared to existing baseline architectures. The code and demo are available online.</description>

      <title>Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Approaches for Improving Detection of Unseen Speech Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current speech deepfake detection approaches perform satisfactorily against known adversaries; however, generalization to unseen attacks remains an open challenge. The proliferation of speech deepfakes on social media underscores the need for systems that can generalize to unseen attacks not observed during training. We address this problem from the perspective of meta-learning, aiming to learn attack-invariant features to adapt to unseen attacks with very few samples available. This approach is promising since generating of a high-scale training dataset is often expensive or infeasible. Our experiments demonstrated an improvement in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 21.67% to 10.42% on the InTheWild dataset, using just 96 samples from the unseen dataset. Continuous few-shot adaptation ensures that the system remains up-to-date.</description>

      <title>Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</description>
