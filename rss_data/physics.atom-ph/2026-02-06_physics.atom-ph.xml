      <title>Relativistic quintuple-zeta basis sets for the p block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic quintuple-zeta basis sets for the p elements are presented. The basis sets for the occupied spinors were optimized at the Dirac-Coulomb self-consistent field (SCF) level on the ground configurations. Valence and core correlating functions were optimized in multireference SDCI calculations on the ground configuration. Diffuse functions optimized on the anion (or derived from neighboring elements for group 18) are also provided. Basic atomic and molecular properties were used to test the newly developed basis sets. A smooth convergence to the basis set limit is observed with increased basis set quality from the previously available double-zeta, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta basis sets to the newly developed quintuple-zeta basis sets for the calculated molecular bond lengths and dissociation energies and for atomic ionization potentials and electron affinities. Use of these basis sets in combination with state-of-the-art approaches for treatment of relativity and correlation will allow significantly increased accuracy in calculations on the heavy elements and their compounds. The basis sets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18351835.</description>

      <title>Direct comparison of multi-ion optical clocks based on $^{40}$Ca$^+$ and $^{88}$Sr$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct frequency comparison between two multi-ion optical clocks based on the S$_{1/2}$ to D$_{5/2}$ transition in \Ca and \Sr ions. Using linear chains of up to nine \Ca ions and six \Sr ions, we demonstrate improved stability as a function of the number of ions that are contributing to the laser frequency stabilization servo. The measured joint fractional frequency stability of the two clocks reaches $1.37(12)\times 10^{-15}$ at one second, placing an upper bound on the same stability of one of the clocks at $9.6(8)\times 10^{-16}$ in one second. We measured the frequency ratio of the two clocks to be $R_{\text{Sr/Ca}}=1.082076536381896986(18)$, where the systematic uncertainty is primarily limited by the room temperature blackbody radiation. Our direct measurement represents an order of magnitude improvement compared to existing indirect frequency ratio measurements. Furthermore, by combining our results with recent absolute frequency measurements of the \Sr transition, referenced to a primary frequency standard, we refined the absolute frequency of the \Ca transition to $\nu_{\text{Ca}^+}=411042129776400.21(4)$ Hz, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of three. This study presents the first direct comparison between two multi-ion optical clocks, highlighting their significant potential for future applications in fundamental physics tests, geodesy, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Correlation and Relativistic Effects on Atomic Ionization Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between relativistic effects and electron correlation effects on the first ionization energies of heavy atoms (Au through Rn, Z = 79-86). We perform two complementary analyses: (1) comparing relativistic corrections computed at both the Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster CCSD(T) levels to assess how correlation influences the magnitude of relativistic corrections, and (2) comparing correlation corrections computed within both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks to determine how relativity influences the magnitude of correlation corrections.
  Our results reveal a striking non-linear relationship between these two effects. Specifically, the combined effect of relativity and correlation on ionization energy does not equal the sum of their individual contributions. This non-additivity indicates that relativistic and correlation effects are not independent; they interact in complex ways that depend on the atomic system. We find that for some atoms, the two effects enhance each other, while for others they partially cancel. Moreover, the order in which one may add "separate" effects also counts, in that adding "pure" relativistic effects to the remaining outcome (including correlation) would give a different result than when adding "pure" correlation effects to the remaining outcome (including relativity).
  These findings demonstrate that relativistic and correlation effects are inherently non-additive, reflecting the non-linearity of the quantum many-body problem. Accurate computational predictions of ionization energies in heavy-element systems thus require simultaneous treatment of both effects rather than treating them as independent contributions.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of the nuclear motion in a molecule from photoelectron momentum distributions using non-Born-Oppenheimer quantum dynamics and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using a neural network that takes momentum distributions of photoelectrons produced in strong-field ionization as input, we retrieve the time-dependent bond length of a dissociating one-dimensional H$_{2}^{+}$ molecule. The photoelectron momentum distributions are calculated from the direct numerical solution of the non-Born-Oppenheimer time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We simulate two setups: first, molecules prepared in the first excited electronic state, second, a pump-probe scheme starting from the ground state. We show that in both schemes a neural network trained on momentum distributions calculated for frozen nuclei retrieves the time-dependent bond length with an absolute error of $0.2$-$0.4$ a.u. We find that a neural network, when applied to photoelectron momentum distributions obtained within the pump-probe scheme, can be used for the retrieval of the equilibrium internuclear distance and ground-state population. This opens new perspectives for extracting electronic properties of molecules from electron momentum distributions using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Extended Rydberg Lifetimes in a Cryogenic Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a $^{133}$Cs optical tweezer array in a cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment. By enclosing the array within a 4K radiation shield, we measure long Rydberg lifetimes, up to $406 (36)\,\mu$s for the $55 P_{3/2}$ Rydberg state, a factor of 3.3(3) longer than the room-temperature value. We employ single-photon coupling for coherent manipulation of the ground-Rydberg qubit. We measure a small differential dynamic polarizability of the transition, beneficial for reducing dephasing due to light intensity fluctuations. Our results pave the path for advancing neutral-atom two-qubit gate fidelities as their error budgets become increasingly dominated by $T_1$ relaxation of the ground-Rydberg qubit.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Deterministic Inference of $k$-Independent Set Instances on Neutral Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy quantum annealing experiments on Rydberg atom arrays produce measurement outcomes that deviate from ideal distributions, complicating performance evaluation. To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate. These scalings indicate that one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponds to neutral atom experiments with up to $N=250-450$ atoms at effective error rates, enabling a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise scaling in continuously operating multiparameter sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.</description>

      <title>Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic structure of materials analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. We calculate the inelastic differential cross section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac Hartree Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal-field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical-trap loading in a large optical-access experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental, numerical, and analytical study of strontium magneto-optical trap (MOT) loading from a cold atomic beam in a configuration optimized for high numerical aperture optical tweezers. Our approach orients the beam flow along the MOT symmetry axis to reduce the experimental complexity and maximize the overall optical access into the scientific region of study. We use a moving molasses technique to enable this configuration and show that its performance depends critically on metastable-state shelving (to 5s5p 3P2) during the atom transfer to the three-dimensional (3D) MOT. Furthermore, we find that the parameters for optimal transfer efficiency are bounded by dark-state loss (to 5s5p 3P0) in the trap region where repumping is present. These observations are verified to great degree of accuracy using both our developed analytical and numerical models. The corresponding 3D simulation tool is used to perform a comprehensive study of the trap loading dynamics, beginning at the oven exit and ending at the 3D MOT, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing an effusive oven experiment.</description>

      <title>Shaping Cold Atom Clouds with a Vortex Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam with a polarization singularity at its center, which creates a point of vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the method to be in principle not diffraction-limited, paving the way for studies of phenomena arising in unconfined atomic ensembles on the micrometer scale.</description>
