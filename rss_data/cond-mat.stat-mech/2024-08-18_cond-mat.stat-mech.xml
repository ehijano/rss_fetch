      <title>Link rewiring with local information--induced hybrid percolation transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a link is occupied to restrict the growth of large clusters using the size information of a finite number of finite clusters, so-called local information, an abrupt but continuous transition is exhibited. We report here that a hybrid transition can occur if each node rewires its links to restrict the growth of large clusters using local information continuously up to a finite number of rewirings. For example, on a branch of a Bethe lattice with coordination number $4$, each node rewires its outgoing links to its descendants several times in ascending order of cluster size to reach a steady state. Then a hybrid transition with nontrivial critical exponents occurs as a function of the link fraction at the steady state. We observe this phenomenon even on a Bethe lattice without hierarchy, supporting that such a phenomenon may occur on diverse tree networks with finite degrees.</description>

      <title>Explosive percolation on the Bethe lattice is ordinary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Achlioptas process, which suppresses the aggregation of large-sized clusters, can exhibit an explosive percolation (EP) where the order parameter emerges abruptly yet continuously in the thermodynamic limit. It is known that EP is accompanied by an abnormally small critical exponent of the order parameter. In this paper, we report that a novel type of EP occurs on a Bethe lattice, where the critical exponent of the order parameter is the same as in ordinary bond percolation based on numerical analysis. This is likely due to the property of a finite Bethe lattice that the number of sites on the surface with only one neighbor is extensive to the system size. To overcome this finite size effect, we consider an approximate size of the cluster that each site on the surface along its branch belongs to, and accordingly approximate the sizes of an extensive number of clusters during simulation. As a result, the Achlioptas process becomes ineffective and the order parameter behaves like that of ordinary percolation at the threshold. We support this result by measuring other critical exponents as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium thermodynamics is grounded in the law of energy conservation, with a specific focus on how systems exchange energy with their environment during transitions between equilibrium states. These transitions are typically characterized by quantities such as heat absorption and the work needed to alter the system's volume. This study is inspired by the potential to develop an analogous, straightforward thermodynamic description for systems that are out of equilibrium. Here, we explore the global energy exchanges that occur during transitions between these nonequilibrium states. We study a system with heat flow and an external (gravity) field that exhibits macroscopic motion, such as Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. We show that the formula for system's energy exchange has the same form as in equilibrium. It opens the possibility of describing out-of-equilibrium systems using a few simple laws similar to equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Extensive Composable Entropy for the Analysis of Cosmological Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along recent decades, an intensive worldwide research activity is focusing both black holes and cosmos (e.g. the dark-energy phenomenon) on the basis of entropic approaches. The Boltzmann-Gibbs-based Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{BH}\propto A/l_P^2$ ($A \equiv$ area; $l_P \equiv$ Planck length) systematically plays a crucial theoretical role although it has a serious drawback, namely that it violates the thermodynamic extensivity of spatially-three-dimensional systems. Still, its intriguing area dependence points out the relevance of considering the form $W(N)\sim \mu^{N^\gamma}\;\;(\mu &gt;1;\gamma &gt;0)$, $W$ and $N$ respectively being the total number of microscopic possibilities and the number of components; $\gamma=1$ corresponds to standard Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. For this $W(N)$ asymptotic behavior, we introduce here, on a group-theory basis, the entropic functional $S_{\alpha,\gamma}=k \Bigl[ \frac{\ln \Sigma_{i=1}^W p_i^\alpha}{1-\alpha} \Bigr]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} \;(\alpha \in \mathbb{R};\,S_{1,1}=S_{BG}\equiv-k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i)$. This functional simultaneously is {\it extensive} (as required by thermodynamics) and {\it composable} (as required for logic consistency), $\forall (\alpha,\gamma)$. We further show that $(\alpha,\gamma)=(1,2/3)$ satisfactorily agrees with cosmological data measuring neutrinos, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the relic abundance of cold dark matter particles, as well as dynamical and geometrical cosmological data sets.</description>

      <title>Sine-Gordon model at finite temperature: the method of random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon quantum field theory at finite temperature by generalizing the method of random surfaces to compute the free energy and one-point functions of exponential operators non-perturbatively. Focusing on the gapped phase of the sine-Gordon model, we demonstrate the method's accuracy by comparing our results to the predictions of other methods and to exact results in the thermodynamic limit. We find excellent agreement between the method of random surfaces and other approaches when the temperature is not too small with respect to the mass gap. Extending the method to more general problems in strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum systems is discussed.</description>

      <title>Triple critical point and emerging temperature scales in $SU(N)$ ferromagnetism at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Abelian ferromagnet recently introduced by the authors, consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$, is studied in the limit where $N$ becomes large and scales as the square root of the number of atoms $n$. This model exhibits additional phases, as well as two different temperature scales related by a factor $N\!/\!\ln N$. The paramagnetic phase splits into a "dense" and a "dilute" phase, separated by a third-order transition and leading to a triple critical point in the scale parameter $n/N^2$ and the temperature, while the ferromagnetic phase exhibits additional structure, and a new paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metastable phase appears at the larger temperature scale. These phases can coexist, becoming stable or metastable as temperature varies. A generalized model in which the number of $SU(N)$-equivalent states enters the partition function with a nontrivial weight, relevant, e.g., when there is gauge invariance in the system, is also studied and shown to manifest similar phases, with the dense-dilute phase transition becoming second-order in the fully gauge invariant case.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and averaged shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as averaged shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Methods for Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time-dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Interpretation of Simulated Polymer Mean-Square Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a path for making quantitative analyses of mean-square displacement curves of polymer chains in the melt or in solution. The approach invokes a general functional form that accurately describes $g(t) \equiv \langle (\Delta x(t))^{2} \rangle$ for all times at which $g(t)$ was measured, and that gives values for the logarithmic derivative of $g(t)$ for the same times. By these means we can readily distinguish between regimes in which $g(t)$ follows a power law in time, does not follow a power law in time, or has an inflection point. In a power-law regime, the method accurately determines the exponent, without imposing any assumption as to the exponent's value.</description>

      <title>Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. This result also implies a quasi-polynomial classical algorithm for computing the expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we also present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>Early-time wetting kinetics in surface-directed spinodal decomposition for off-critical quenches: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) in binary fluid mixtures ($A+B$) with off-critical compositions. The aim is to elucidate the role of composition ratio in the early-time wetting kinetics under the influence of long-range surface potential. In our simulations, the attractive part of surface potential varies as $V(z)= -\epsilon_a/z^{n}$, with $\epsilon_{a}$ being the surface-potential strength. The surface prefers `$A$' species to form the wetting layer. Its thickness [$R_1(t)$] for the majority wetting (number of $A$-type particles [$N_A$] &gt; number of $B$-type particles [$N_B$]), grows as a power-law with an exponent $1/(n+2)$. This is consistent with the early-time kinetics in the form of potential-dependent growth present in the Puri-Binder model. However, for minority wetting ($N_A$ &lt; $N_B$), the growth exponent in $R_1(t)$ is less than $1/(n+2)$. Furthermore, on decreasing the field strength $\epsilon_{a}$, we recover $1/(n+2)$ for a minority wetting case. We provide phenomenological arguments to explain the early-time wetting kinetics for both cases.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of heat in quantum mechanics is ambiguous. Complications arise in particular when the coupling between a quantum system and an environment is non-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the distinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction coordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between the system and environment. Here we combine the reaction coordinate technique with a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of heat: energetic changes in the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the mapping), and energetic changes in the residual environment Hamiltonian (after the mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more expected of a thermal environment in the highly non-Markovian regime considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new avenue in which percolation, which has been much associated with critical phase transitions, can also dictate the asymptotic dynamics of non-Hermitian systems by breaking PT symmetry. Central to it is our newly-designed mechanism of topologically guided gain, where chiral edge wavepackets in a topological system experience non-Hermitian gain or loss based on how they are topologically steered. For sufficiently wide topological islands, this leads to irreversible growth due to positive feedback from interlayer tunneling. As such, a percolation transition that merges small topological islands into larger ones also drives the edge spectrum across a real to complex transition. Our discovery showcases intriguing dynamical consequences from the triple interplay of chiral topology, directed gain and interlayer tunneling, and suggests new routes for the topology to be harnessed in the control of feedback systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry and quantum Mpemba effect in two-dimensional free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is the counter-intuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon wherein the dynamic restoration of a broken symmetry occurs more rapidly when the initial state exhibits a higher degree of symmetry breaking. The effect has been recently discovered theoretically and observed experimentally in the framework of global quantum quenches, but so far it has only been investigated in one-dimensional systems. Here we focus on a two-dimensional free-fermion lattice employing the entanglement asymmetry as a measure of symmetry breaking. Our investigation begins with the ground state analysis of a system featuring nearest-neighbor hoppings and superconducting pairings, the latter breaking explicitly the $U(1)$ particle number symmetry. We compute analytically the entanglement asymmetry of a periodic strip using dimensional reduction, an approach that allows us to adjust the extent of the transverse size, achieving a smooth crossover between one and two dimensions. Further applying the same method, we study the time evolution of the entanglement asymmetry after a quench to a Hamiltonian with only nearest-neighbor hoppings, preserving the particle number symmetry which is restored in the stationary state. We find that the quantum Mpemba effect is strongly affected by the size of the system in the transverse dimension, with the potential to either enhance or spoil the phenomenon depending on the initial states. We establish the conditions for its occurrence based on the properties of the initial configurations, extending the criteria found in the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and extend Fisher's argument for a Ginzburg-Landau description of multicritical Yang-Lee models in terms of a single boson Lagrangian with potential $\varphi^2 (i \varphi)^n$. We explicitly study the cases of $n=1,2$ by a Truncated Hamiltonian Approach based on the free massive boson perturbed by $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetric deformations, providing clear evidence of the spontaneous breaking of $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetry. For $n=1$, the symmetric and the broken phases are separated by the critical point corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$, while for $n=2$, they are separated by a critical manifold corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$ with $\mathcal M(2,7)$ on its boundary. Our numerical analysis strongly supports our Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for multicritical Yang-Lee models.</description>

      <title>Resonant-force induced symmetry breaking in a quantum parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases including the prebifurcation regime where the system is close but not too close to the bifurcation point.</description>

      <title>Efficient mapping of phase diagrams with conditional Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of phase diagrams is of central importance for both the fundamental understanding of materials as well as for technological applications in material sciences. However, the computational prediction of the relative stability between phases based on their free energy is a daunting task, as traditional free energy estimators require a large amount of simulation data to obtain uncorrelated equilibrium samples over a grid of thermodynamic states. In this work, we develop deep generative machine learning models based on the Boltzmann Generator approach for entire phase diagrams, employing normalizing flows conditioned on the thermodynamic states, e.g., temperature and pressure, that they map to. By training a single normalizing flow to transform the equilibrium distribution sampled at only one reference thermodynamic state to a wide range of target temperatures and pressures, we can efficiently generate equilibrium samples across the entire phase diagram. Using a permutation-equivariant architecture allows us, thereby, to treat solid and liquid phases on the same footing. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the solid-liquid coexistence line for a Lennard-Jones system in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art free energy methods while significantly reducing the number of energy evaluations needed.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariance of Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a recently proposed shifting operation on classical phase space as a gauge transformation for statistical mechanical microstates. The infinitesimal generators of the continuous gauge group form a non-commutative Lie algebra, which induces exact sum rules when thermally averaged. Gauge invariance with respect to finite shifting is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation in the transformed phase space which generates identical equilibrium averages. Our results point towards a deeper basis of statistical mechanics than previously known and they offer avenues for systematic construction of exact identities and of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exponential growth rate of lattice comb polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a lattice model of comb polymers and derive bounds on the exponential growth rate of the number of embeddings of the comb. A comb is composed of a backbone that is a self-avoiding walk and a set of $t$ teeth, also modelled as mutually and self-avoiding walks, attached to the backbone at vertices or nodes of degree 3. Each tooth of the comb has $m_a$ edges and there are $m_b$ edges in the backbone between adjacent degree 3 vertices and between the first and last nodes of degree 3 and the end vertices of degree 1 of the backbone. We are interested in the exponential growth rate as $t \to \infty$ with $m_a$ and $m_b$ fixed. We prove upper bounds on this growth rate and show that for small values of $m_a$ the growth rate is strictly less than that of self-avoiding walks.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms, and construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=1/2$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

Abstract: Exactly ergodicity in boundary-driven semi-infinite cellular automata (CA) are investigated. We establish all the ergodic rules in CA with 3, 4, and 5 states. We analytically prove the ergodicity for 12 rules in 3-state CA and 118320 rules in 5-state CA with any ergodic and periodic boundary condition, and numerically confirm all the other rules non-ergodic with some boundary condition. We classify ergodic rules into several patterns, which exhibit a variety of ergodic structure.</description>
