      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Informed Handheld Breast Ultrasound for Screening: A Systematic Review of Diagnostic Test Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Breast cancer screening programs using mammography have led to significant mortality reduction in high-income countries. However, many low- and middle-income countries lack resources for mammographic screening. Handheld breast ultrasound (BUS) is a low-cost alternative but requires substantial training. Artificial intelligence (AI) enabled BUS may aid in both the detection (perception) and classification (interpretation) of breast cancer. Materials and Methods. This review (CRD42023493053) is reported in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) and SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-analysis) guidelines. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from January 1, 2016 to December 12, 2023. A meta-analysis was not attempted. Studies are grouped according to their AI task type, application time, and AI task. Study quality is assessed using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results. Of 763 candidate studies, 314 total full texts were reviewed. 34 studies are included. The AI tasks of included studies are as follows: 1 frame selection, 6 detection, 11 segmentation, and 16 classification. In total, 5.7 million BUS images from over 185,000 patients were used for AI training or validation. A single study included a prospective testing set. 79% of studies were at high or unclear risk of bias. Conclusion. There has been encouraging development of AI for BUS. Despite studies demonstrating high performance across all identified tasks, the evidence supporting AI-enhanced BUS generally lacks robustness. High-quality model validation will be key to realizing the potential for AI-enhanced BUS in increasing access to screening in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Learning for Microbubble Localization in Super-Resolution Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.</description>

      <title>T2-Only Prostate Cancer Prediction by Meta-Learning from Bi-Parametric MR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current imaging-based prostate cancer diagnosis requires both MR T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences, with additional sequences for potentially greater accuracy improvement. However, measuring diffusion patterns in DWI sequences can be time-consuming, prone to artifacts and sensitive to imaging parameters. While machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated radiologist-level accuracy in detecting prostate cancer from these two sequences, this study investigates the potential of ML-enabled methods using only the T2w sequence as input during inference time. We first discuss the technical feasibility of such a T2-only approach, and then propose a novel ML formulation, where DWI sequences - readily available for training purposes - are only used to train a meta-learning model, which subsequently only uses T2w sequences at inference. Using multiple datasets from more than 3,000 prostate cancer patients, we report superior or comparable performance in localising radiologist-identified prostate cancer using our proposed T2-only models, compared with alternative models using T2-only or both sequences as input. Real patient cases are presented and discussed to demonstrate, for the first time, the exclusively true-positive cases from models with different input sequences.</description>

      <title>Towards Seamless Integration of Magnetic Tracking into Fluoroscopy-guided Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2D projective nature of X-ray radiography presents significant limitations in fluoroscopy-guided interventions, particularly the loss of depth perception and prolonged radiation exposure. Integrating magnetic trackers into these workflows is promising; however, it remains challenging and under-explored in current research and practice. To address this, we employed a radiolucent magnetic field generator (FG) prototype as a foundational step towards seamless magnetic tracking (MT) integration. A two-layer FG mounting frame was designed for compatibility with various C-arm X-ray systems, ensuring smooth installation and optimal tracking accuracy. To overcome technical challenges, including accurate C-arm pose estimation, robust fluoro-CT registration, and 3D navigation, we proposed the incorporation of external aluminum fiducials without disrupting conventional workflows. Experimental evaluation showed no clinically significant impact of the aluminum fiducials and the C-arm on MT accuracy. Our fluoro-CT registration demonstrated high accuracy (mean projection distance approxiamtely 0.7 mm, robustness (wide capture range), and generalizability across local and public datasets. In a phantom targeting experiment, needle insertion error was between 2 mm and 3 mm, with real-time guidance using enhanced 2D and 3D navigation. Overall, our results demonstrated the efficacy and clinical applicability of the MT-assisted approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate a radiolucent FG into a fluoroscopy-guided workflow.</description>

      <title>MaDiNet: Mamba Diffusion Network for SAR Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental challenge in SAR target detection lies in developing discriminative, efficient, and robust representations of target characteristics within intricate non-cooperative environments. However, accurate target detection is impeded by factors including the sparse distribution and discrete features of the targets, as well as complex background interference. In this study, we propose a \textbf{Ma}mba \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{Net}work (MaDiNet) for SAR target detection. Specifically, MaDiNet conceptualizes SAR target detection as the task of generating the position (center coordinates) and size (width and height) of the bounding boxes in the image space. Furthermore, we design a MambaSAR module to capture intricate spatial structural information of targets and enhance the capability of the model to differentiate between targets and complex backgrounds. The experimental results on extensive SAR target detection datasets achieve SOTA, proving the effectiveness of the proposed network.

      <title>A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Radiotherapy: Leveraging the Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Ensuring the precision in motion tracking for MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is crucial for the delivery of effective treatments. This study refined the motion tracking accuracy in MRIgRT through the innovation of an automatic real-time tracking method, leveraging an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework coupled with automatic segmentation. Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking method by integrating two primary methods: the ETLD framework and an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The TLD framework was upgraded to suit real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. Additionally, ICV was combined for precise coverage of the target volume, which refined the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. Tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases, our method ensures precise tracking and accurate segmentation vital for MRIgRT. Results: An evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions revealed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects, underscoring the robustness and efficacy of the ETLD. Moreover, the ETLD+ICV yielded a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the proposed method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusions: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time motion tracking method for MRIgRT that markedly surpasses current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also demonstrates enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, positioning it as an indispensable asset in the quest to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Inverse Consistent Diffeomorphic Lung Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic deformable image registration ensures smooth invertible transformations across inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans. Yet, in practice, deep learning-based diffeomorphic methods struggle to capture large deformations between inspiratory and expiratory volumes, and therefore lack inverse consistency. Existing methods also fail to account for model uncertainty, which can be useful for improving performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware test-time adaptation framework for inverse consistent diffeomorphic lung registration. Our method uses Monte Carlo (MC) dropout to estimate spatial uncertainty that is used to improve model performance. We train and evaluate our method for inspiratory-to-expiratory CT registration on a large cohort of 675 subjects from the COPDGene study, achieving a higher Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the lung boundaries (0.966) compared to both VoxelMorph (0.953) and TransMorph (0.953). Our method demonstrates consistent improvements in the inverse registration direction as well with an overall DSC of 0.966, higher than VoxelMorph (0.958) and TransMorph (0.956). Paired t-tests indicate statistically significant improvements.</description>

      <title>SegQC: a segmentation network-based framework for multi-metric segmentation quality control and segmentation error detection in volumetric medical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality control of structures segmentation in volumetric medical images is important for identifying segmentation errors in clinical practice and for facilitating model development. This paper introduces SegQC, a novel framework for segmentation quality estimation and segmentation error detection. SegQC computes an estimate measure of the quality of a segmentation in volumetric scans and in their individual slices and identifies possible segmentation error regions within a slice. The key components include: 1. SegQC-Net, a deep network that inputs a scan and its segmentation mask and outputs segmentation error probabilities for each voxel in the scan; 2. three new segmentation quality metrics, two overlap metrics and a structure size metric, computed from the segmentation error probabilities; 3. a new method for detecting possible segmentation errors in scan slices computed from the segmentation error probabilities. We introduce a new evaluation scheme to measure segmentation error discrepancies based on an expert radiologist corrections of automatically produced segmentations that yields smaller observer variability and is closer to actual segmentation errors. We demonstrate SegQC on three fetal structures in 198 fetal MRI scans: fetal brain, fetal body and the placenta. To assess the benefits of SegQC, we compare it to the unsupervised Test Time Augmentation (TTA)-based quality estimation. Our studies indicate that SegQC outperforms TTA-based quality estimation in terms of Pearson correlation and MAE for fetal body and fetal brain structures segmentation. Our segmentation error detection method achieved recall and precision rates of 0.77 and 0.48 for fetal body, and 0.74 and 0.55 for fetal brain segmentation error detection respectively. SegQC enhances segmentation metrics estimation for whole scans and individual slices, as well as provides error regions detection.</description>

      <title>AI enhanced diagnosis of Peyronies disease a novel approach using Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative AI-driven tool for diagnosing Peyronie's Disease (PD), a condition that affects between 0.3% and 13.1% of men worldwide. Our method uses key point detection on both images and videos to measure penile curvature angles, utilizing advanced computer vision techniques. This tool has demonstrated high accuracy in identifying anatomical landmarks, validated against conventional goniometer measurements. Traditional PD diagnosis often involves subjective and invasive methods, which can lead to patient discomfort and inaccuracies. Our approach offers a precise, reliable, and non-invasive diagnostic tool to address these drawbacks. The model distinguishes between PD and normal anatomical changes with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 100%. This advancement represents a significant improvement in urological diagnostics, greatly enhancing the efficacy and convenience of PD assessment for healthcare providers and patients.</description>

      <title>LapGSR: Laplacian Reconstructive Network for Guided Thermal Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, the fusion of multi-modal data has been widely studied for various applications such as robotics, gesture recognition, and autonomous navigation. Indeed, high-quality visual sensors are expensive, and consumer-grade sensors produce low-resolution images. Researchers have developed methods to combine RGB color images with non-visual data, such as thermal, to overcome this limitation to improve resolution. Fusing multiple modalities to produce visually appealing, high-resolution images often requires dense models with millions of parameters and a heavy computational load, which is commonly attributed to the intricate architecture of the model.
  We propose LapGSR, a multimodal, lightweight, generative model incorporating Laplacian image pyramids for guided thermal super-resolution. This approach uses a Laplacian Pyramid on RGB color images to extract vital edge information, which is then used to bypass heavy feature map computation in the higher layers of the model in tandem with a combined pixel and adversarial loss. LapGSR preserves the spatial and structural details of the image while also being efficient and compact. This results in a model with significantly fewer parameters than other SOTA models while demonstrating excellent results on two cross-domain datasets viz. ULB17-VT and VGTSR datasets.</description>

      <title>CT-Mamba: A Hybrid Convolutional State Space Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) significantly reduces the radiation dose received by patients, thereby decreasing potential health risks. However, dose reduction introduces additional noise and artifacts, adversely affecting image quality and clinical diagnosis. Currently, denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) face limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, while Transformer-based denoising methods, although capable of powerful long-range modeling, suffer from high computational complexity. Furthermore, the denoised images predicted by deep learning-based techniques inevitably exhibit differences in noise distribution compared to Normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which can also impact the final image quality and diagnostic outcomes. In recent years, the feasibility of applying deep learning methods to low-dose CT imaging has been demonstrated, leading to significant achievements. This paper proposes CT-Mamba, a hybrid convolutional State Space Model for LDCT image denoising. The model combines the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs with Mamba's global modeling capability, enabling it to capture both local details and global context. Additionally, a Mamba-driven deep noise power spectrum (NPS) loss function was designed to guide model training, ensuring that the noise texture of the denoised LDCT images closely resembles that of NDCT images, thereby enhancing overall image quality and diagnostic value. Experimental results have demonstrated that CT-Mamba performs excellently in reducing noise in LDCT images, enhancing detail preservation, and optimizing noise texture distribution, while demonstrating statistically similar radiomics features to those of NDCT images (p &gt; 0.05). The proposed CT-Mamba demonstrates outstanding performance in LDCT denoising and holds promise as a representative approach for applying the Mamba framework to LDCT denoising tasks.</description>

      <title>DuoLift-GAN:Reconstructing CT from Single-view and Biplanar X-Rays with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) provides highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) medical images but is costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in intraoperative settings (Organization et al. 2011). Recent advancements have explored reconstructing 3D chest volumes from sparse 2D X-rays, such as single-view or orthogonal double-view images. However, current models tend to process 2D images in a planar manner, prioritizing visual realism over structural accuracy. In this work, we introduce DuoLift Generative Adversarial Networks (DuoLift-GAN), a novel architecture with dual branches that independently elevate 2D images and their features into 3D representations. These 3D outputs are merged into a unified 3D feature map and decoded into a complete 3D chest volume, enabling richer 3D information capture. We also present a masked loss function that directs reconstruction towards critical anatomical regions, improving structural accuracy and visual quality. This paper demonstrates that DuoLift-GAN significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy while achieving superior visual realism compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>DINO-LG: A Task-Specific DINO Model for Coronary Calcium Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07976v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the most common cause of mortality in the world. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is key for risk assessment to prevent coronary disease. Previous studies on risk assessment and calcification detection in CT scans primarily use approaches based on UNET architecture, frequently implemented on pre-built models. However, these models are limited by the availability of annotated CT scans containing CAC and suffering from imbalanced dataset, decreasing performance of CAC segmentation and scoring. In this study, we extend this approach by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) to eliminate limitations of scarce annotated data in CT scans. The DINO model's ability to train without requiring CAC area annotations enhances its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO model is trained on to focus specifically on calcified areas by using labels, aiming to generate features that effectively capture and highlight key characteristics. The label-guided DINO (DINO-LG) enhances classification by distinguishing CT slices that contain calcification from those that do not, performing 57% better than the standard DINO model in this task. CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are performed by a basic U-NET architecture, fed specifically with CT slices containing calcified areas as identified by the DINO-LG model. This targeted identification performed by DINO-LG model improves CAC segmentation performance by approximately 10% and significant increase in CAC scoring accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Variational Autoencoders for Medical Image Generation: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational autoencoder (VAE) is one of the most common techniques in the field of medical image generation, where this architecture has shown advanced researchers in recent years and has developed into various architectures. VAE has advantages including improving datasets by adding samples in smaller datasets and in datasets with imbalanced classes, and this is how data augmentation works. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on VAE in medical imaging, with a special focus on their ability to create synthetic images close to real data so that they can be used for data augmentation. This study reviews important architectures and methods used to develop VAEs for medical images and provides a comparison with other generative models such as GANs on issues such as image quality, and low diversity of generated samples. We discuss recent developments and applications in several medical fields highlighting the ability of VAEs to improve segmentation and classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>MSEG-VCUQ: Multimodal SEGmentation with Enhanced Vision Foundation Models, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Uncertainty Quantification for High-Speed Video Phase Detection Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07463v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: High-speed video (HSV) phase detection (PD) segmentation is vital in nuclear reactors, chemical processing, and electronics cooling for detecting vapor, liquid, and microlayer phases. Traditional segmentation models face pixel-level accuracy and generalization issues in multimodal data. MSEG-VCUQ introduces VideoSAM, a hybrid framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based vision models to enhance segmentation accuracy and generalizability across complex multimodal PD tasks. Methods: VideoSAM combines U-Net CNN and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced feature extraction and segmentation across diverse HSV PD modalities, spanning fluids like water, FC-72, nitrogen, and argon under varied heat flux conditions. The framework also incorporates uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess pixel-based discretization errors, delivering reliable metrics such as contact line density and dry area fraction under experimental conditions. Results: VideoSAM outperforms SAM and modality-specific CNN models in segmentation accuracy, excelling in environments with complex phase boundaries, overlapping bubbles, and dynamic liquid-vapor interactions. Its hybrid architecture supports cross-dataset generalization, adapting effectively to varying modalities. The UQ module provides accurate error estimates, enhancing the reliability of segmentation outputs for advanced HSV PD research. Conclusion: MSEG-VCUQ, via VideoSAM, offers a robust solution for HSV PD segmentation, addressing previous limitations with advanced deep learning and UQ techniques. The open-source datasets and tools introduced enable scalable, precise, and adaptable segmentation for multimodal PD datasets, supporting advancements in HSV analysis and autonomous experimentation.

      <title>Quantifying Knowledge Distillation Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation provides an effective method for deploying complex machine learning models in resource-constrained environments. It typically involves training a smaller student model to emulate either the probabilistic outputs or the internal feature representations of a larger teacher model. By doing so, the student model often achieves substantially better performance on a downstream task compared to when it is trained independently. Nevertheless, the teacher's internal representations can also encode noise or additional information that may not be relevant to the downstream task. This observation motivates our primary question: What are the information-theoretic limits of knowledge transfer? To this end, we leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify the distillable and distilled knowledge of a teacher's representation corresponding to a given student and a downstream task. Moreover, we demonstrate that this metric can be practically used in distillation to address challenges caused by the complexity gap between the teacher and the student representations.</description>

      <title>SoundSil-DS: Deep Denoising and Segmentation of Sound-field Images with Silhouettes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of optical technology has enabled imaging of two-dimensional (2D) sound fields. This acousto-optic sensing enables understanding of the interaction between sound and objects such as reflection and diffraction. Moreover, it is expected to be used an advanced measurement technology for sonars in self-driving vehicles and assistive robots. However, the low sound-pressure sensitivity of the acousto-optic sensing results in high intensity of noise on images. Therefore, denoising is an essential task to visualize and analyze the sound fields. In addition to denoising, segmentation of sound and object silhouette is also required to analyze interactions between them. In this paper, we propose sound-field-images-with-object-silhouette denoising and segmentation (SoundSil-DS) that jointly perform denoising and segmentation for sound fields and object silhouettes on a visualized image. We developed a new model based on the current state-of-the-art denoising network. We also created a dataset to train and evaluate the proposed method through acoustic simulation. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and measured data. We confirmed that our method can applied to experimentally measured data. These results suggest that the proposed method may improve the post-processing for sound fields, such as physical model-based three-dimensional reconstruction since it can remove unwanted noise and separate sound fields and other object silhouettes. Our code is available at https://github.com/nttcslab/soundsil-ds.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Feature Enhancement Network for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the scarcity of labeled samples in Image Quality Assessment (IQA) datasets, numerous recent studies have proposed multi-task based strategies, which explore feature information from other tasks or domains to boost the IQA task. Nevertheless, multi-task strategies based No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods encounter several challenges. First, existing methods have not explicitly exploited texture details, which significantly influence the image quality. Second, multi-task methods conventionally integrate features through simple operations such as addition or concatenation, thereby diminishing the network's capacity to accurately represent distorted features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-task NR-IQA framework. Our framework consists of three key components: a high-frequency extraction network, a quality estimation network, and a distortion-aware network. The high-frequency extraction network is designed to guide the model's focus towards high-frequency information, which is highly related to the texture details. Meanwhile, the distortion-aware network extracts distortion-related features to distinguish different distortion types. To effectively integrate features from different tasks, a feature fusion module is developed based on an attention mechanism. Empirical results from five standard IQA databases confirm that our method not only achieves high performance but also exhibits robust generalization ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently, deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in the fields of image processing, image classification, object identification and many more. In this work, we implemented convolutional neural network based modified U-Net model and VGG-UNet model to automatically identify objects from satellite imagery captured using high resolution Indian remote sensing satellites and then to pixel wise classify satellite data into various classes. In this paper, Cartosat 2S (~1m spatial resolution) datasets were used and deep learning models were implemented to detect building shapes and ships from the test datasets with an accuracy of more than 95%. In another experiment, microwave data (varied resolution) from RISAT-1 was taken as an input and ships and trees were detected with an accuracy of &gt;96% from these datasets. For the classification of images into multiple-classes, deep learning model was trained on multispectral Cartosat images. Model generated results were then tested using ground truth. Multi-label classification results were obtained with an accuracy (IoU) of better than 95%. Total six different problems were attempted using deep learning models and IoU accuracies in the range of 85% to 98% were achieved depending on the degree of complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information-Empowered Graph Neural Network for Hyperspectral Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a critical remote sensing technique for identifying changes in the Earth's surface over time. The outstanding substance identifiability of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has significantly enhanced the detection accuracy, making hyperspectral change detection (HCD) an essential technology. The detection accuracy can be further upgraded by leveraging the graph structure of HSIs, motivating us to adopt the graph neural networks (GNNs) in solving HCD. For the first time, this work introduces quantum deep network (QUEEN) into HCD. Unlike GNN and CNN, both extracting the affine-computing features, QUEEN provides fundamentally different unitary-computing features. We demonstrate that through the unitary feature extraction procedure, QUEEN provides radically new information for deciding whether there is a change or not. Hierarchically, a graph feature learning (GFL) module exploits the graph structure of the bitemporal HSIs at the superpixel level, while a quantum feature learning (QFL) module learns the quantum features at the pixel level, as a complementary to GFL by preserving pixel-level detailed spatial information not retained in the superpixels. In the final classification stage, a quantum classifier is designed to cooperate with a traditional fully connected classifier. The superior HCD performance of the proposed QUEEN-empowered GNN (i.e., QUEEN-G) will be experimentally demonstrated on real hyperspectral datasets.</description>

      <title>Understanding Audiovisual Deepfake Detection: Techniques, Challenges, Human Factors and Perceptual Insights</title>

Abstract: Deep Learning has been successfully applied in diverse fields, and its impact on deepfake detection is no exception. Deepfakes are fake yet realistic synthetic content that can be used deceitfully for political impersonation, phishing, slandering, or spreading misinformation. Despite extensive research on unimodal deepfake detection, identifying complex deepfakes through joint analysis of audio and visual streams remains relatively unexplored. To fill this gap, this survey first provides an overview of audiovisual deepfake generation techniques, applications, and their consequences, and then provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods that combine audio and visual modalities to enhance detection accuracy, summarizing and critically analyzing their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss existing open source datasets for a deeper understanding, which can contribute to the research community and provide necessary information to beginners who want to analyze deep learning-based audiovisual methods for video forensics. By bridging the gap between unimodal and multimodal approaches, this paper aims to improve the effectiveness of deepfake detection strategies and guide future research in cybersecurity and media integrity.</description>

      <title>No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment via Graph Convolutional Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, as an emerging visual media format, is increasingly favored by consumers as it can provide more realistic visual information than two-dimensional (2D) data. Similar to 2D plane images and videos, point clouds inevitably suffer from quality degradation and information loss through multimedia communication systems. Therefore, automatic point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is of critical importance. In this work, we propose a novel no-reference PCQA method by using a graph convolutional network (GCN) to characterize the mutual dependencies of multi-view 2D projected image contents. The proposed GCN-based PCQA (GC-PCQA) method contains three modules, i.e., multi-view projection, graph construction, and GCN-based quality prediction. First, multi-view projection is performed on the test point cloud to obtain a set of horizontally and vertically projected images. Then, a perception-consistent graph is constructed based on the spatial relations among different projected images. Finally, reasoning on the constructed graph is performed by GCN to characterize the mutual dependencies and interactions between different projected images, and aggregate feature information of multi-view projected images for final quality prediction. Experimental results on two publicly available benchmark databases show that our proposed GC-PCQA can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art quality assessment metrics. The code will be available at: https://github.com/chenwuwq/GC-PCQA.</description>

      <title>CDXFormer: Boosting Remote Sensing Change Detection with Extended Long Short-Term Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers have quadratic computational complexity, and Mambas are restricted by CUDA acceleration. In this paper, we propose CDXFormer, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Models for Enhanced Neuroimaging Diagnostics in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in medical diagnostics, particularly in radiology, where datasets such as X-rays are paired with human-generated diagnostic reports. However, a significant research gap exists in the neuroimaging field, especially for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, due to the lack of comprehensive diagnostic reports that can be utilized for model fine-tuning. This paper addresses this gap by generating synthetic diagnostic reports using GPT-4o-mini on structured data from the OASIS-4 dataset, which comprises 663 patients. Using the synthetic reports as ground truth for training and validation, we then generated neurological reports directly from the images in the dataset leveraging the pre-trained BiomedCLIP and T5 models. Our proposed method achieved a BLEU-4 score of 0.1827, ROUGE-L score of 0.3719, and METEOR score of 0.4163, revealing its potential in generating clinically relevant and accurate diagnostic reports.</description>

      <title>Commissioning An All-Sky Infrared Camera Array for Detection Of Airborne Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.</description>

Abstract: This work develops a novel set of algorithms, alternating Gradient Descent (GD) and minimization for MRI (altGDmin-MRI1 and altGDmin-MRI2), for accelerated dynamic MRI by assuming an approximate low-rank (LR) model on the matrix formed by the vectorized images of the sequence. The LR model itself is well-known in the MRI literature; our contribution is the novel GD-based algorithms which are much faster, memory efficient, and general compared with existing work; and careful use of a 3-level hierarchical LR model. By general, we mean that, with a single choice of parameters, our method provides accurate reconstructions for multiple accelerated dynamic MRI applications, multiple sampling rates and sampling schemes.
  We show that our methods outperform many of the popular existing approaches while also being faster than all of them, on average. This claim is based on comparisons on 8 different retrospectively under sampled multi-coil dynamic MRI applications, sampled using either 1D Cartesian or 2D pseudo radial under sampling, at multiple sampling rates. Evaluations on some prospectively under sampled datasets are also provided. Our second contribution is a mini-batch subspace tracking extension that can process new measurements and return reconstructions within a short delay after they arrive. The recovery algorithm itself is also faster than its batch counterpart.</description>

      <title>Functional Imaging Constrained Diffusion for Brain PET Synthesis from Structural MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02504</link>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are increasingly used in multimodal analysis of neurodegenerative disorders. While MRI is broadly utilized in clinical settings, PET is less accessible. Many studies have attempted to use deep generative models to synthesize PET from MRI scans. However, they often suffer from unstable training and inadequately preserve brain functional information conveyed by PET. To this end, we propose a functional imaging constrained diffusion (FICD) framework for 3D brain PET image synthesis with paired structural MRI as input condition, through a new constrained diffusion model (CDM). The FICD introduces noise to PET and then progressively removes it with CDM, ensuring high output fidelity throughout a stable training phase. The CDM learns to predict denoised PET with a functional imaging constraint introduced to ensure voxel-wise alignment between each denoised PET and its ground truth. Quantitative and qualitative analyses conducted on 293 subjects with paired T1-weighted MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans suggest that FICD achieves superior performance in generating FDG-PET data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed FICD on data from a total of 1,262 subjects through three downstream tasks, with experimental results suggesting its utility and generalizability.</description>

      <title>SLOctolyzer: Fully automatic analysis toolkit for segmentation and feature extracting in scanning laser ophthalmoscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to introduce SLOctolyzer: an open-source analysis toolkit for en face retinal vessels in infrared reflectance scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images.
  Methods: SLOctolyzer includes two main modules: segmentation and measurement. The segmentation module uses deep learning methods to delineate retinal anatomy, and detects the fovea and optic disc, whereas the measurement module quantifies the complexity, density, tortuosity, and calibre of the segmented retinal vessels. We evaluated the segmentation module using unseen data and measured its reproducibility.
  Results: SLOctolyzer's segmentation module performed well against unseen internal test data (Dice for all-vessels = 0.91; arteries = 0.84; veins = 0.85; optic disc = 0.94; and fovea = 0.88). External validation against severe retinal pathology showed decreased performance (Dice for arteries = 0.72; veins = 0.75; and optic disc = 0.90). SLOctolyzer had good reproducibility (mean difference for fractal dimension = -0.001; density = -0.0003; calibre = -0.32 microns; and tortuosity density = 0.001). SLOctolyzer can process a 768 x 768 pixel macula-centred SLO image in under 20 seconds and a disc-centred SLO image in under 30 seconds using a laptop CPU.
  Conclusions: To our knowledge, SLOctolyzer is the first open-source tool to convert raw SLO images into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinal vascular parameters. SLO images are captured simultaneous to optical coherence tomography (OCT), and we believe SLOctolyzer will be useful for extracting retinal vascular measurements from large OCT image sets and linking them to ocular or systemic diseases. It requires no specialist knowledge or proprietary software, and allows manual correction of segmentations and re-computing of vascular metrics.

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained Models for FF-to-FFPE Histopathological Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18054</link>

Abstract: The two primary types of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) slides in histopathology are Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) and Fresh Frozen (FF). FFPE slides offer high quality histopathological images but require a labor-intensive acquisition process. In contrast, FF slides can be prepared quickly, but the image quality is relatively poor. Our task is to translate FF images into FFPE style, thereby improving the image quality for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-FFPE, a method for FF-to-FFPE histopathological image translation using a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, we utilize a one-step diffusion model as the generator, which we fine-tune using LoRA adapters within an adversarial learning framework. To enable the model to effectively capture both global structural patterns and local details, we introduce a multi-scale feature fusion module that leverages two VAE encoders to extract features at different image resolutions, performing feature fusion before inputting them into the UNet. Additionally, a pre-trained vision-language model for histopathology serves as the backbone for the discriminator, enhancing model performance. Our FF-to-FFPE translation experiments on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. The code and models are released at https://github.com/QilaiZhang/Diffusion-FFPE.</description>
