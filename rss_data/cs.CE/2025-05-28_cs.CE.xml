      <title>GIT-BO: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Tabular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) effectively optimizes expensive black-box functions but faces significant challenges in high-dimensional spaces (dimensions exceeding 100) due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing high-dimensional BO methods typically leverage low-dimensional embeddings or structural assumptions to mitigate this challenge, yet these approaches frequently incur considerable computational overhead and rigidity due to iterative surrogate retraining and fixed assumptions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient-Informed Bayesian Optimization using Tabular Foundation Models (GIT-BO), an approach that utilizes a pre-trained tabular foundation model (TFM) as a surrogate, leveraging its gradient information to adaptively identify low-dimensional subspaces for optimization. We propose a way to exploit internal gradient computations from the TFM's forward pass by creating a gradient-informed diagnostic matrix that reveals the most sensitive directions of the TFM's predictions, enabling optimization in a continuously re-estimated active subspace without the need for repeated model retraining. Extensive empirical evaluation across 23 synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates that GIT-BO consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art Gaussian process-based high-dimensional BO methods, showing superior scalability and optimization performances, especially as dimensionality increases up to 500 dimensions. This work establishes foundation models, augmented with gradient-informed adaptive subspace identification, as highly competitive alternatives to traditional Gaussian process-based approaches for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Reduced and mixed precision turbulent flow simulations using explicit finite difference schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of reduced and mixed precision computing has gained increasing attention in high-performance computing (HPC) as a means to improve computational efficiency, particularly on modern hardware architectures like GPUs. In this work, we explore the application of mixed precision arithmetic in compressible turbulent flow simulations using explicit finite difference schemes. We extend the OPS and OpenSBLI frameworks to support customizable precision levels, enabling fine-grained control over precision allocation for different computational tasks. Through a series of numerical experiments on the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, we demonstrate that mixed precision strategies, such as half-single and single-double combinations, can offer significant performance gains without compromising numerical accuracy. However, pure half-precision computations result in unacceptable accuracy loss, underscoring the need for careful precision selection. Our results show that mixed precision configurations can reduce memory usage and communication overhead, leading to notable speedups, particularly on multi-CPU and multi-GPU systems.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Nyquist Criteria in the Discretization of 2D Electromagnetic Integral Equations at High Frequency: Spectral Insights into Pollution Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of boundary integral equations in modeling boundary value problems-such as elastic, acoustic, or electromagnetic ones-is well established in the literature and widespread in practical applications. These equations are typically solved numerically using boundary element methods (BEMs), which generally provide accurate and reliable solutions. When the frequency of the wave phenomenon under study increases, the discretization of the problem is typically chosen to maintain a fixed number of unknowns per wavelength. Under these conditions, the BEM over finite-dimensional subspaces of piecewise polynomial basis functions is commonly believed to provide a bounded solution accuracy. If proven, this would constitute a significant advantage of the BEM with respect to finite element and finite difference time domain methods, which, in contrast, are affected by numerical pollution. In this work, we conduct a rigorous spectral analysis of some of the most commonly used boundary integral operators and examine the impact of the BEM discretization on the solution accuracy of widely used integral equations modeling two-dimensional electromagnetic scattering from a perfectly electrically conducting cylinder. We consider both ill-conditioned and well-conditioned equations, the latter being characterized by solution operators bounded independently of frequency. Our analysis, which is capable of tracking the effects of BEM discretization on compositions and sums of different operators, reveals a form of pollution that affects, in different measures, equations of both kinds. After elucidating the mechanism by which the BEM discretization impacts accuracy, we propose a solution strategy that can cure the pollution problem thus evidenced. The defining strength of the proposed theoretical model lies in its capacity to deliver deep insight into the root causes of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Out of the Past: An AI-Enabled Pipeline for Traffic Simulation from Noisy, Multimodal Detector Data and Stakeholder Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can a traffic simulation be designed to faithfully reflect real-world traffic conditions? Past data-driven approaches to traffic simulation in the literature have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics. They also fail to adequately account for the effects of uncertainty and multimodality in the data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for generating a traffic simulation from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we demonstrate that our pipeline can accurately capture the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, our traffic simulation framework can be generalized to other municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</description>

      <title>FinTagging: An LLM-ready Benchmark for Extracting and Structuring Financial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FinTagging, the first full-scope, table-aware XBRL benchmark designed to evaluate the structured information extraction and semantic alignment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of XBRL-based financial reporting. Unlike prior benchmarks that oversimplify XBRL tagging as flat multi-class classification and focus solely on narrative text, FinTagging decomposes the XBRL tagging problem into two subtasks: FinNI for financial entity extraction and FinCL for taxonomy-driven concept alignment. It requires models to jointly extract facts and align them with the full 10k+ US-GAAP taxonomy across both unstructured text and structured tables, enabling realistic, fine-grained evaluation. We assess a diverse set of LLMs under zero-shot settings, systematically analyzing their performance on both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Our results reveal that, while LLMs demonstrate strong generalization in information extraction, they struggle with fine-grained concept alignment, particularly in disambiguating closely related taxonomy entries. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in fully automating XBRL tagging and underscore the need for improved semantic reasoning and schema-aware modeling to meet the demands of accurate financial disclosure. Code is available at our GitHub repository and data is at our Hugging Face repository.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Multi-Expert Generative Language Model System for Engineering Information and Knowledge Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above. The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times. Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute clusters.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Data-Driven And Theory-Driven Modelling - Leveraging Causal Machine Learning for Integrative Modelling of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical machine learning techniques often struggle with overfitting and unreliable predictions when exposed to novel conditions. Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing predictive robustness. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data center system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph based molecular representation learning is essential for accurately predicting molecular properties in drug discovery and materials science; however, it faces significant challenges due to the intricate relationships among molecules and the limited chemical knowledge utilized during training. While contrastive learning is often employed to handle molecular relationships, its reliance on binary metrics is insufficient for capturing the complexity of these interactions. Multimodal fusion has gained attention for property reasoning, but previous work has explored only a limited range of modalities, and the optimal stages for fusing different modalities in molecular property tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MMFRL (Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our method enhances embedding initialization through multimodal pretraining using relational learning. We also conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of modality fusion at different stages such as early, intermediate, and late, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that MMFRL significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, MMFRL enables task-specific optimizations. Additionally, the explainability of MMFRL provides valuable chemical insights, emphasizing its potential to enhance real-world drug discovery applications.</description>

      <title>A batch production scheduling problem in a reconfigurable hybrid manufacturing-remanufacturing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, remanufacturing of End-of-Life (EOL) products has been adopted by manufacturing sectors as a competent practice to enhance their sustainability and market share. Due to the mass customization of products and high volatility of market, processing of new products and remanufacturing of EOLs in the same shared facility, namely Hybrid Manufacturing-Remanufacturing System (HMRS), is a mean to keep such production efficient. Accordingly, customized production capabilities are required to increase flexibility, which can be effectively provided under the Reconfigurable Manufacturing System (RMS) paradigm. Despite the advantages of utilizing RMS technologies in HMRSs, production management of such systems suffers excessive complexity. Hence, this study concentrates on the production scheduling of an HMRS consisting of non-identical parallel reconfigurable machines where the orders can be grouped into batches. In this regard, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models are devised to formulate the problem. Furthermore, a computationally efficient solution method is developed based on a Logic-based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The warm start technique is also implemented by providing a decent initial solution to the MILP model. Computational experiments attest to the LBBD method's superiority over the MILP, CP, and warm-started MILP models by obtaining an average gap of about 2%, besides it yields actionable managerial insights for scheduling in HMRSs.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo: A Machine Learning View on Control Variate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many complex simulation tasks spanning areas such as healthcare, engineering, and finance, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are invaluable due to their unbiased estimates and precise error quantification. Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulations often become computationally prohibitive, especially for nested, multi-level, or path-dependent evaluations lacking effective variance reduction techniques. While machine learning (ML) surrogates appear as natural alternatives, naive replacements typically introduce unquantifiable biases. We address this challenge by introducing Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo (PEMC), a framework that leverages modern ML models as learned predictors, using cheap and parallelizable simulation as features, to output unbiased evaluation with reduced variance and runtime. PEMC can also be viewed as a "modernized" view of control variates, where we consider the overall computation-cost-aware variance reduction instead of per-replication reduction, while bypassing the closed-form mean function requirement and maintaining the advantageous unbiasedness and uncertainty quantifiability of Monte Carlo.
  We illustrate PEMC's broader efficacy and versatility through three examples: first, equity derivatives such as variance swaps under stochastic local volatility models; second, interest rate derivatives such as swaption pricing under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) interest-rate model. Finally, we showcase PEMC in a socially significant context - ambulance dispatch and hospital load balancing - where accurate mortality rate estimates are key for ethically sensitive decision-making. Across these diverse scenarios, PEMC consistently reduces variance while preserving unbiasedness, highlighting its potential as a powerful enhancement to standard Monte Carlo baselines.</description>
