      <title>Towards a Unified Benchmark and Framework for Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of structure-spectrum relationships is essential for spectral interpretation, impacting structural elucidation and material design. Predicting spectra from molecular structures is challenging due to their complex relationships. Herein, we introduce NMRNet, a deep learning framework using the SE(3) Transformer for atomic environment modeling, following a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. To support the evaluation of NMR chemical shift prediction models, we have established a comprehensive benchmark based on previous research and databases, covering diverse chemical systems. Applying NMRNet to these benchmark datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility in real-world scenarios. This marks the first integration of solid and liquid state NMR within a unified model architecture, highlighting the need for domainspecific handling of different atomic environments. Our work sets a new standard for NMR prediction, advancing deep learning applications in analytical and structural chemistry.</description>

      <title>Deep potential for interaction between hydrated Cs+ and graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of hydrated cation-{\pi} interaction forces on the adsorption and filtration capabilities of graphene-based membrane materials is significant. However, the lack of interaction potential between hydrated Cs+ and graphene limits the scope of adsorption studies. Here, it is developed that a deep neural network potential function model to predict the interaction force between hydrated Cs+ and graphene. The deep potential has DFT-level accuracy, enabling accurate property prediction. This deep potential is employed to investigate the properties of the graphene surface solution, including the density distribution, mean square displacement, and vibrational power spectrum of water. Furthermore, calculations of the molecular orbital electron distributions indicate the presence of electron migration in the molecular orbitals of graphene and hydrated Cs+, resulting in a strong electrostatic interaction force. The method provides a powerful tool to study the adsorption behavior of hydrated cations on graphene surfaces and offers a new solution for handling radionuclides.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference of collision frequencies from x-ray Thomson scattering spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thomson scattering spectra measure the response of plasma particles to incident radiation. In warm dense matter, which is opaque to visible light, x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) enables a detailed probe of the electron distribution and has been used as a diagnostic for electron temperature, density, and plasma ionization. In this work, we examine the sensitivities of inelastic XRTS signatures to modeling details including the dynamic collision frequency and the electronic density of states. Applying verified Monte Carlo inversion methods to dynamic structure factors obtained from time-dependent density functional theory, we assess the utility of XRTS signals as a way to inform the dynamic collision frequency, especially its direct-current (DC) limit, which is directly related to the electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Estimating QSVT angles for matrix inversion with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a state-of-the-art, near-optimal quantum algorithm that can be used for matrix inversion. The QSVT circuit is parameterized by a sequence of angles that must be pre-calculated classically, with the number of angles increasing as the matrix condition number grows. Computing QSVT angles for ill-conditioned problems is a numerically challenging task. We propose a numerical technique for estimating QSVT angles for large condition numbers. This technique allows one to avoid expensive numerical computations of QSVT angles and to emulate QSVT circuits for solving ill-conditioned problems.</description>

      <title>Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we obtain more than a hundred fold speedup relative to a leading ensemble MCMC approach that requires numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate machine-learned interatomic potentials for large-scale simulations of Cu, Al and Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become widely used in the development of interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations. However, most ML potentials are still much slower than classical interatomic potentials and are usually trained with near equilibrium simulations in mind. In this work, we develop ML potentials for Cu, Al and Ni using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method. Specifically, we create the low-dimensional tabulated versions (tabGAP) of the potentials, which allow for two orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency than the GAPs, enabling simulations of large multi-million atomic systems. The ML potentials are trained using diverse curated databases of structures and include fixed external repulsive potentials for short-range interactions. The potentials are extensively validated and used to simulate a wide range of fundamental materials properties, such as stacking faults and threshold displacement energies. Furthermore, we use the potentials to simulate single-crystal uniaxial compressive loading in different crystal orientations with both pristine simulation cells and cells containing pre-existing defects.</description>

      <title>chemtrain: Learning Deep Potential Models via Automatic Differentiation and Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Networks (NNs) are promising models for refining the accuracy of molecular dynamics, potentially opening up new fields of application. Typically trained bottom-up, atomistic NN potential models can reach first-principle accuracy, while coarse-grained implicit solvent NN potentials surpass classical continuum solvent models. However, overcoming the limitations of costly generation of accurate reference data and data inefficiency of common bottom-up training demands efficient incorporation of data from many sources. This paper introduces the framework chemtrain to learn sophisticated NN potential models through customizable training routines and advanced training algorithms. These routines can combine multiple top-down and bottom-up algorithms, e.g., to incorporate both experimental and simulation data or pre-train potentials with less costly algorithms. chemtrain provides an object-oriented high-level interface to simplify the creation of custom routines. On the lower level, chemtrain relies on JAX to compute gradients and scale the computations to use available resources. We demonstrate the simplicity and importance of combining multiple algorithms in the examples of parametrizing an all-atomistic model of titanium and a coarse-grained implicit solvent model of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Metaplectic Geometrical Optics for Reduced Modeling of Plasma Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The WKB approximation of geometrical optics is widely used in plasma physics, quantum mechanics and reduced wave modeling in general. However, it is well-known that the approximation breaks down at focal and turning points. In this work we present the first unsupervised numerical implementation of the recently developed metaplectic geometrical optics framework, which extends the applicability of geometrical optics beyond the limitations of WKB, such that the wave field remains finite at caustics. The implementation is in 1D and uses a combination of Gauss-Freud quadrature and barycentric rational function inter- and extrapolation to perform an inverse metaplectic transform numerically. The capabilities of the numerical implementation are demonstrated on Airy's and Weber's equation, which both have exact solutions to compare with. Finally, the implementation is applied to the plasma physics problem of linear conversion of X-mode to electron Bernstein waves at the upper hybrid layer and a comparison is made with results from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. In all three applications we find good agreement between the exact results and the new reduced wave modeling paradigm of metaplectic geometrical optics.</description>

      <title>DEMPgen: Physics event generator for Deep Exclusive Meson Production at Jefferson Lab and the EIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, as they provide access to Generalized Parton Distributions over a broad kinematic range, and are the only means of measuring pion and kaon charged electric form factors at high $Q^2$. Such investigations are a particularly useful tool in the study of hadronic structure in QCD's transition regime from long-distance interactions described in terms of meson-nucleon degrees of freedom, to short-dist ance interactions governed by hard quark-gluon degrees of freedom. To assist the planning of future experimental investigations of DEMP reactions in this transition regime, such as at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we have written a special purpose event generator, DEMPgen. Several types of DEMP reactions can be generated: $t$-channel $p(e,e^{\prime}\pi^+)n$, $p(e,e^{\prime}K^+)\Lambda[\Sigma^0]$, and $\vec{n}(e,e^{\prime}\pi^-)p$ from a polarized $^3$He target. DEMPgen is modular in form, so that additional reactions can be added over time. The generator produces kinematically-complete reaction events which are absolutely-normalized, so that projected event rates can be predicted, and detector resolution requirements studied. The event normalization is based on parameterizations of theoretical models, appropriate to the kinematic regime under study. Both fixed target modes and collider beam modes are supported. This paper presents the structure of the generator, the model parameterizations used for absolute event weighting, the kinematic distributions of the generated particles, some initial results using the generator, and instructions for its use.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{e}$) of 5.56[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{e}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>
