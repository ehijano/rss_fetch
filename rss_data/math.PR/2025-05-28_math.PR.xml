      <title>Rough backward SDEs with discontinuous Young drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to backward differential equations that are driven hybridly by a deterministic discontinuous rough path $W$ of finite $q$-variation for $q \in [1, 2)$ and by Brownian motion $B$. To distinguish between integration of jumps in a forward- or Marcus-sense, we refer to these equations as forward- respectively Marcus-type rough backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs). We establish global well-posedness by proving global apriori bounds for solutions and employing fixed-point arguments locally. Furthermore, we lift the RBSDE solution and the driving rough noise to the space of decorated paths endowed with a Skorokhod-type metric and show stability of solutions with respect to perturbations of the rough noise. Finally, we prove well-posedness for a new class of backward doubly stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs), which are jointly driven by a Brownian martingale $B$ and an independent discontinuous stochastic process $L$ of finite $q$-variation. We explain, how our RBSDEs can be understood as conditional solutions to such BDSDEs, conditioned on the information generated by the path of $L$.</description>

      <title>A note on the improved sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities for quadratic forms of sparse $\alpha$-sub-exponential random vectors where $\alpha \in (0,2]$. When only considering the regime $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$, we derive a sharper sparse Hanson-Wright inequality that achieves optimality in certain special cases. These results generalize some classical Hanson-Wright inequalities without sparse structure.</description>

      <title>Extension of a theorem of Wschebor to free and matrix Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1992, M. Wschebor proved a theorem on the convergence of small increments of the Brownian motion. Since then, it has been extended to various processes. We prove a version of this theorem for the Hermitian Brownian motion and the free Brownian motion. Since these theorems deal with a convergence to a deterministic limit, we prove also the convergence in distribution of the corresponding fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Construction and limit theorems for supCAR fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a new class of random fields, supCAR fields, which are constructed as superpositions of continuous autoregressive random fields. These supCAR fields possess infinitely divisible marginal distributions. Their second-order properties are characterised by a novel family of covariance functions which can exhibit short- and long-range spatial dependencies. First, the existence of such fields is examined. Then, functional limit theorems for supCAR fields are derived under general assumptions. Four limiting scenarios that depend on the marginals of the underlying autoregressive fields and the specifications of the superposition are identified. Examples of specific supCAR fields, for which the assumptions and results are provided in simple, explicit forms, are presented. The obtained limit theorems can be employed for the statistical inference of supCAR fields.</description>

      <title>A transfer principle for computing the adapted Wasserstein distance between stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a transfer principle to study the adapted 2-Wasserstein distance between stochastic processes. First, we obtain an explicit formula for the distance between real-valued mean-square continuous Gaussian processes by introducing the causal factorization as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Cholesky decomposition for operators on Hilbert spaces. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of this causal factorization and link it to the canonical representation of Gaussian processes. As a byproduct, we characterize mean-square continuous Gaussian Volterra processes in terms of their natural filtrations. Moreover, for real-valued fractional stochastic differential equations, we show that the synchronous coupling between the driving fractional noises attains the adapted Wasserstein distance under some monotonicity conditions. Our results cover a wide class of stochastic processes which are neither Markov processes nor semi-martingales, including fractional Brownian motions and fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Information Aggregation: Optimal Structure of Signal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework to study signal networks, in which nodes can be active or inactive, and their activation or deactivation is driven by external signals and the states of the nodes to which they are connected via links. The focus is on determining the optimal number of key nodes (= highly connected and structurally important nodes) required to represent the global activation state of the network accurately. Motivated by neuroscience, medical science, and social science examples, we describe the node dynamics as a continuous-time inhomogeneous Markov process. Under mean-field and homogeneity assumptions, appropriate for large scale-free and disassortative signal networks, we derive differential equations characterising the global activation behaviour and compute the expected hitting time to network triggering. Analytical and numerical results show that two or three key nodes are typically sufficient to approximate the overall network state well, balancing sensitivity and robustness. Our findings provide insight into how natural systems can efficiently aggregate information by exploiting minimal structural components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a refined definition of the class of random matrix ensembles introduced in our paper "Structured random matrices and cyclic cumulants: A free probability approach" (arXiv:2309.14315) by extending the so-called fourth axiom to deal with cumulants of disjoint cycles. We argue that the theorems concerning the stability of such ensembles under non-linear transformations still hold with these refined axioms.</description>

      <title>An Unconstrained Optimization Approach to Moment Fitting with Phase Type Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase type (PH) distributions are widely used in modeling and simulation due to their generality and analytical properties. In such settings, it is often necessary to construct a PH distribution that aligns with real-world data by matching a set of prescribed moments. Existing approaches provide either exact closed-form solutions or iterative procedures that may yield exact or approximate results. However, these methods are limited to matching a small number of moments using PH distributions with a small number of phases, or are restricted to narrow subclasses within the PH family. We address the problem of approximately fitting a larger set of given moments using potentially large PH distributions. We introduce an optimization methodology that relies on a re-parametrization of the Markovian representation, formulated in a space that enables unconstrained optimization of the moment-matching objective. This reformulation allows us to scale to significantly larger PH distributions and capture higher moments. Results on a large and diverse set of moment targets show that the proposed method is, in the vast majority of cases, capable of fitting as many as 20 moments to PH distributions with as many as 100 phases, with small relative errors on the order of under 0.5% from each target. We further demonstrate an application of the optimization framework where we search for a PH distribution that conforms not only to a given set of moments but also to a given shape. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of this approach through a queueing application, presenting a case study that examines the influence of the i^{th} moment of the inter-arrival and service time distributions on the steady-state probabilities of the GI/GI/1 queue length.</description>

      <title>A ZeNN architecture to avoid the Gaussian trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low dimensional domains.</description>

      <title>Strong Low Degree Hardness for the Number Partitioning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the number partitioning problem (NPP) one aims to partition a given set of $N$ real numbers into two subsets with approximately equal sum. The NPP is a well-studied optimization problem and is famous for possessing a statistical-to-computational gap: when the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are i.i.d. standard gaussian, the optimal discrepancy is $2^{-\Theta(N)}$ with high probability, but the best known polynomial-time algorithms only find solutions with a discrepancy of $2^{-\Theta(\log^2 N)}$. This gap is a common feature in optimization problems over random combinatorial structures, and indicates the need for a study that goes beyond worst-case analysis.
  We provide evidence of a nearly tight algorithmic barrier for the number partitioning problem. Namely we consider the family of low coordinate degree algorithms (with randomized rounding into the Boolean cube), and show that degree $D$ algorithms fail to solve the NPP to accuracy beyond $2^{-\widetilde O(D)}$. According to the low degree heuristic, this suggests that simple brute-force search algorithms are nearly unimprovable, given any allotted runtime between polynomial and exponential in $N$. Our proof combines the isolation of solutions in the landscape with a conditional form of the overlap gap property: given a good solution to an NPP instance, slightly noising the NPP instance typically leaves no good solutions near the original one. In fact our analysis applies whenever the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are independent with uniformly bounded density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of stochastic time-discretization schemes for evolution equations driven by random velocity fields, including examples like stochastic gradient descent and interacting particle systems. Using a unified framework based on Multivalued Probability Vector Fields, we analyze these dynamics at the level of probability measures in the Wasserstein space. Under suitable dissipativity and boundedness conditions, we prove that the laws of the interpolated trajectories converge to those of a limiting evolution governed by a maximal dissipative extension of the associated barycentric field. This provides a general measure-theoretic study for the convergence of stochastic schemes in continuous time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the target function is not only a simple expectation of the accumulated reward. Instead, we consider rather general functionals of the joint distribution of terminal state and accumulated reward which have to be optimized. For finite state and compact action space, we show how to solve these problems by defining a lifted MDP whose state space is the space of distributions over the true states of the process. We derive a Bellman equation in this setting, which can be considered as a distributional Bellman equation. Well-known cases like the standard MDP and quantile MDPs are shown to be special examples of our framework. We also apply our model to a variant of an optimal transport problem.</description>

      <title>Scheduling with Uncertain Holding Costs and its Application to Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost ($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm, Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical algorithmic principles.</description>

      <title>Random periodic solutions for stochastic differential equations with non-uniform dissipativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of random periodic solutions for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where the drift terms involved need not to be uniformly dissipative. On the one hand, via the reflection coupling approach, we investigate the existence of random periodic solutions in the sense of distribution for SDEs without memory, where the drifts are merely dissipative at long distance. On the other hand, via the synchronous coupling strategy, we establish respectively the existence of pathwise random periodic solutions for functional SDEs with a finite time lag and an infinite time lag, in which the drifts are only dissipative on average rather than uniformly dissipative with respect to the time parameters.</description>

      <title>Many-Server Queueing Systems with Heterogeneous Strategic Servers in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most service systems, the servers are humans who desire to experience a certain level of idleness. In call centers, this manifests itself as the call avoidance behavior, where servers strategically adjust their service rate to strike a balance between the idleness they receive and effort to work harder. Moreover, being humans, each server values this trade-off differently and has different capabilities. Drawing ideas on mean-field games we develop a novel framework relying on measure-valued processes to simultaneously address strategic server behavior and inherent server heterogeneity in service systems. This framework enables us to extend the recent literature on strategic servers in four new directions by: (i) incorporating individual choices of servers, (ii) incorporating individual abilities of servers, (iii) modeling the discomfort experienced by servers due to low levels of idleness, and (iv) considering more general routing policies. Using our framework, we are able to asymptotically characterize asymmetric Nash equilibria for many-server systems with strategic servers.
  In simpler cases, it has been shown that the purely quality-driven regime is asymptotically optimal. However, we show that if the discomfort increases fast enough as the idleness approaches zero, the quality-and-efficiency-driven regime and other quality driven regimes can be optimal. This is the first time this conclusion appears in the literature.</description>

      <title>Simple Relative Deviation Bounds for Covariance and Gram Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and Gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

      <title>SPDE for stochastic SIR epidemic models with infection-age dependent infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic SIR epidemic model with infection-age dependent infectivity for which a measure-valued process is used to describe the ages of infection for each individual. We establish a functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the properly scaled measure-valued processes together with the other epidemic processes to describe the evolution dynamics. In the FLLN, assuming that the hazard rate function of the infection periods is bounded and the ages at time 0 of the infections of the initially infected individuals are bounded, we obtain a PDE limit for the LLN-scaled measure-valued process, for which we characterize its solution explicitly. The PDE is linear with a boundary condition given by the unique solution to a set of Volterra-type nonlinear integral equations. In the FCLT, we obtain an SPDE for the CLT-scaled measure-valued process, driven by two independent white noises coming from the infection and recovery processes. The SPDE is also linear and coupled with the solution to a system of stochastic Volterra-type linear integral equations driven by three independent Gaussian noises, one from the random infection functions in addition to the two white noises mentioned above. The solution to the SPDE can be also explicitly characterized, given this auxiliary process. The uniqueness of the SPDE solution is established under stronger assumptions (density and its derivative being locally bounded) on the distribution function of an infectious duration.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [12] and [13, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work and of [20]. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>A uniform particle approximation to the Navier-Stokes-alpha models in three dimensions with advection noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a system of interacting particles governed by a set of stochastic differential equations. Our main goal is to rigorously demonstrate that the empirical measure associated with the particle system converges uniformly, both in time and space, to the solution of the three dimensional Navier Stokes alpha model with advection noise. This convergence establishes a probabilistic framework for deriving macroscopic stochastic fluid equations from underlying microscopic dynamics. The analysis leverages semigroup techniques to address the nonlinear structure of the limiting equations, and we provide a detailed treatment of the well posedness of the limiting stochastic partial differential equation. This ensures that the particle approximation remains stable and controlled over time. Although similar convergence results have been obtained in two dimensional settings, our study presents the first proof of strong uniform convergence in three dimensions for a stochastic fluid model derived from an interacting particle system. Importantly, our results also yield new insights in the deterministic regime, namely, in the absence of advection noise, where this type of convergence had not been previously established.</description>

      <title>Any random variable with right-unbounded distributional support is the minimum of independent and very heavy-tailed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random variable X has a light-tailed distribution (for short: is light-tailed) if it possesses a finite exponential moment, E \exp (cX) is finite for some c&gt;0, and has a heavy-tailed distribution (is heavy-tailed) if E \exp (cX) is infinite, for all c&gt;0. Leipus, Siaulys and Konstantinides (2023) presented a particular example of a light-tailed random variable that is the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. We show that this phenomenon is universal: any light-tailed random variable with right-unbounded support may be represented as the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. Moreover, a more general fact holds: these two independent random variables may have as heavy-tailed distributions as one wishes. Further, we extend the latter result onto the minimum of any finite number of independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem and SPDE for epidemic model with memory of the last infection and waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of a stochastic epidemic model with memory of the last infections, varying infectivity, and waning immunity, as introduced in Guerin and Zotsa-Ngoufack:arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.00601. The dynamics of the epidemic model are described by a measure-valued process with respect to infection age and individual traits. The Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN) is formulated as an integral equation, which is solved by a deterministic measure. In this article, we establish the Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT), capturing the fluctuations of the stochastic model around its deterministic limit. The limit of the FCLT is given by a nonlinear stochastic integral equation which is solved by a random signed-measure. We further derive the weak solution in the form of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) and propose an alternative representation of the FCLT, as fluctuations in the average total force of infection and average susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Effective growth rates in a periodically changing environment: From mutation to invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive dynamics for an asexually reproducing population with mutation, with linear birth and death rates, as well as a density-dependent competition. To depict repeating changes of the environment, all of these parameters vary over time as piecewise constant and periodic functions, on an intermediate time-scale between those of stabilization of the resident population (fast) and exponential growth of mutants (slow). Studying the growth of emergent mutants and their invasion of the resident population in the limit of small mutation rates for a simultaneously diverging population size, we are able to determine their effective growth rates. We describe this growth as a mesoscopic scaling-limit of the orders of population sizes, where we observe an averaging effect of the invasion fitness. Moreover, we prove a limit result for the sequence of consecutive macroscopic resident traits that is similar to the so-called trait-substitution-sequence.</description>

      <title>Tian's theorem for Grassmannian embeddings and degeneracy sets of random sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold, $(L,h^L)$ be a positive line bundle, and $(E,h^E)$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $r$ on $X$. We prove that the pullback by the Kodaira embedding associated to $L^p\otimes E$ of the $k$-th Chern class of the dual of the universal bundle over the Grassmannian converges as $p\to\infty$ to the $k$-th power of the Chern form $c_1(L,h^L)$, for $0\leq k\leq r$. If $c_1(L,h^L)=\omega$ we also determine the second term in the semiclassical expansion, which involves $c_1(E,h^E)$. As a consequence we show that the limit distribution of zeros of random sequences of holomorphic sections of high powers $L^p\otimes E$ is $c_1(L,h^L)^r$. Furthermore, we compute the expectation of the currents of integration along degeneracy sets of random holomorphic sections.</description>
