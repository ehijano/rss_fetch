      <title>Spatiotemporal Low FIP Abundance: A Catalyst for Coronal Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona, and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.</description>

      <title>Quiet Sun Ellerman bombs as a possible proxy for reconnection-driven spicules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spicules are elongated, jet-like structures that populate the solar chromosphere and are rooted in the photosphere. In recent years, high-resolution observations and advanced numerical simulations have provided insights into their properties, structures, and dynamics. However, the formation mechanism of spicules, particularly the more dynamic type II spicules, which are primarily found in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, remains elusive. This study explores whether quiet Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs), which are ubiquitous small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower atmosphere, are linked to the formation of type II spicules. We analysed a high-quality 40-minute time sequence acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. H-beta data were used to observe QSEBs and spicules, while spectropolarimetric measurements in the photospheric Fe i 6173 A line provided line-of-sight magnetic field information. We employed k-means clustering to automatically detect QSEBs and explored their potential association with spicules. We identified 80 clear cases where spicules occurred soon after the QSEB and not later than 30 s after the ending of the QSEBs. All events involved type II spicules, rapidly fading from the images. The footpoints of the spicules seemed to be rooted in QSEBs, where the onset of QSEBs often preceded the formation of the associated spicules. Additionally, we found around 500 other events that hinted at a connection but with some ambiguities. The combined clear and ambiguous cases constitute 34% of the total detected QSEBs and a smaller percentage of the spicules in our dataset. Our findings suggest that a fraction of type II spicules originate from QSEBs, supporting magnetic reconnection as a potential driving mechanism. In this context, QSEBs and spicules represent the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Signatures of Warps in Edge-on Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks observed edge-on commonly show asymmetries that can be caused by shadows cast from a warp. With the growing amount of these observations, methods to constrain warp parameters are urgently needed. In this work, we investigate observational signatures of warps in edge-on disks with the aim to find limits on the observability of warps. We perform radiative transfer simulations in scattered light (near-/mid-infrared) of edge-on disks containing warps of different amplitudes and varying sizes of the misaligned inner region. We analyze the effect of these parameters at 0.8 micron, but also compare models for specific parameters at wavelengths up to 21 micron. In all models, we quantify the apparent asymmetry. We find that under optimal conditions, an asymmetry due to slight warps can be visible. The visibility depends on the viewing angle, as warped disks are not axisymmetric. For optimal azimuthal orientation, misalignments between inner and outer disk regimes as low as 2{\deg} can lead to significant asymmetries. On the other hand, we find that larger misalignments of about 10{\deg} are needed in order to observe a change in the brightest nebula as a function of wavelength, which is observed in a few protoplanetary disks. In order to link our results to observations, we investigate potential misalignments between the inner and outer disk of edge-on systems showing asymmetries. We compare the jet geometry, which traces the inner region of the disk, to the outer disk orientation and find that a misalignment of a few degrees could be present, such that warped disks could explain the apparent lateral asymmetries. There are many factors that can influence the appearance of the shadows and asymmetries in warped disks. Although it is still challenging to infer exact warp parameters from observations, this work presents a promising step toward better constraints.</description>

      <title>Signature of spin-down stalling in stellar magnetic activity. The case of the open cluster NGC 6811</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation and magnetic activity have a complex evolution that reveals multiple regimes. One of the related transitions that is seen in the rotation distribution for main-sequence (MS) solar-like stars has been attributed to core-envelope coupling and the consequent angular-momentum transfer between a fast core and a slow envelope. This feature is known as spin-down stalling and is related to the intermediate-rotation gap seen in field stars. Beyond this rotation signature, we search for evidence of it in stellar magnetic activity. We investigated the magnetic activity of the 1 Gyr old NGC 6811, a Kepler-field cluster, and Kepler MS stars of different ages. The magnetic activity was measured through the photometric magnetic activity proxy, Sph. To characterize the evolution of the magnetic activity for the Kepler sample, we split it according to the relative rotation and computed the respective activity sequences. We found the signature of core-envelope coupling in the magnetic activity of NGC 6811 and in the Kepler MS sample. In NGC 6811, we found enhanced magnetic activity for a range of effective temperatures that remained for significant timescales. In the Kepler sample, the magnetic activity sequences pile up in two distinct regions: at high activity levels that coincide with stars near the stalling mentioned above, where a behavior inversion is observed (slowly rotating stars have higher activity levels than fast-rotating stars, which is opposite to the overall behavior); and at low activity levels corresponding to slow rotators close to the detection limit, potentially facing a weakening of the magnetic braking. These results support the recent proposition that the strong shear experienced by stars during the core-envelope coupling phase can cause enhanced activity. This study helps us to shed light on the interplay between rotation, magnetic activity, and their evolution.</description>

      <title>Search for the Blazhko effect in field RR Lyrae stars using LINEAR and ZTF light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the incidence and properties of RR Lyrae stars that show evidence for amplitude and phase modulation (the so-called Blazhko Effect) in a sample of $\sim$3,000 stars with LINEAR and ZTF light curve data collected during the periods of 2002-2008 and 2018-2023, respectively. A preliminary subsample of about $\sim$500 stars was algorithmically pre-selected using various data quality and light curve statistics, and then 228 stars were confirmed visually as displaying the Blazhko effect. This sample increases the number of field RR Lyrae stars displaying the Blazhko effect by more than 50\% and places a lower limit of (11.4$\pm$0.8)\% for their incidence rate. We find that ab type RR Lyrae that show the Blazhko effect have about 5\% (0.030 day) shorter periods than starting sample, a 7.1$\sigma$ statistically significant difference. We find no significant differences in their light curve amplitudes and apparent magnitude (essentially, signal-to-noise ratio) distributions. No period or other differences are found for c type RR Lyrae. We find convincing examples of stars where the Blazhko effect can appear and disappear on time scales of several years. With time-resolved photometry expected from LSST, a similar analysis will be performed for even larger samples of field RR Lyrae stars in the southern sky and we anticipate a higher fraction of discovered Blazhko stars due to better sampling and superior photometric quality.</description>

      <title>The UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Large Director's Discretionary Program with Hubble. I. Goals, Design, and Initial Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specifically selected to leverage the unique ultraviolet capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) is a Director's Discretionary program of approximately 1000 orbits - the largest ever executed - that produced a UV spectroscopic library of O and B stars in nearby low metallicity galaxies and accreting low mass stars in the Milky Way. Observations from ULLYSES combined with archival spectra uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime, including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive stars, and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass stars. The ULLYSES spectral library of massive stars will be critical to characterize how massive stars evolve at different metallicities; to advance our understanding of the production of ionizing photons, and thus of galaxy evolution and the re-ionization of the Universe; and to provide the templates necessary for the synthesis of integrated stellar populations. The massive star spectra are also transforming our understanding of the interstellar and circumgalactic media of low metallicity galaxies. On the low-mass end, UV spectra of T Tauri stars contain a plethora of diagnostics of accretion, winds, and the warm disk surface. These diagnostics are crucial for evaluating disk evolution and provide important input to assess atmospheric escape of planets and to interpret powerful probes of disk chemistry, as observed with ALMA and JWST. In this paper we motivate the design of the program, describe the observing strategy and target selection, and present initial results.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Solar Spicules in a Polar Coronal Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of solar spicules at millimeter wavelengths (mm-$\lambda$) using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These are supplemented by observations in optical (O), ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. The observations were made on 2018 December 25 of the northern polar coronal hole. ALMA obtained time-resolved imaging observations at wavelengths of 3 mm (100 GHz; 2~s cadence) and 1.25~mm (239 GHz; $\approx 2$~min cadence) with an angular resolution of $2.2" \times 1.3"$ and $1.5" \times 0.7"$, respectively. Spicules observed at mm-$\lambda$ are easily seen low in the chromosphere whereas spicules in UV bands are seen to extend higher. The spicules observed at mm-$\lambda$ are seen in absorption against coronal EUV emission, allowing us to estimate the column depth of neutral hydrogen. Spicular emission at mm-$\lambda$, due to thermal free-free radiation, allows us to estimate the electron number density as a function of height. We find that spicule densities, inferred from the mm-$\lambda$ data are uniquely insensitive to assumptions regarding the temperature of plasma in spicules. We suggest that the upward mass flux carried by spicules is unlikely to play a significant role in the mass budget of the solar corona and solar wind, and the transport of hot material into the corona by spicules may not play a significant role in coronal heating. However, the possibility that electric currents, fast kink and torsional waves, or other wave modes carried by spicules may play a role in transporting energy into the solar corona cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Rotationally Driven Ultraviolet Emission of Red Giant Stars II. Metallicity, Activity, Binarity and Sub-subgiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars are overwhelmingly observed to rotate very slowly compared to main-sequence stars, but a few percent of them show rapid rotation and high activity, often as a result of tidal synchronizationn or other angular momentum transfer events. In this paper we build upon previous work using a sample of 7,286 RGB stars from APOGEE DR17 with measurable rotation. We derive an updated NUV excess vs $v \sin{i}$ rotation-activity relation that is consistent with our previous published version, but reduces uncertainty through the inclusion of a linear [M/H] correction term. We find that both single stars and binary stars generally follow our rotation-activity relation, but single stars seemingly saturate at $P_{\text{rot}}$/$\sin{i}$ $\sim$10 days while binary stars show no sign of saturation, suggesting they are able to carry substantially stronger magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) to be the most active giant binaries, with rotation synchronized to orbits with periods $\lesssim$ 20 days. Given their unusually high level of activity compared to other short-period synchronized giants we suspect the SSGs are most commonly overactive RS CVn stars. Using estimates of critical rotation we identify a handful giants rotating near break-up and determine tidal spin up to this level of rotation is highly unlikely and instead suggest planetary engulfment or stellar mergers in a fashion generally proposed for FK Comae stars.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Neutrino Magnetic Moments on the Evolution of the Helium Flash and Lithium-Rich Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the neutrino magnetic moment (NMM,$\mu_v$) is one of the most significant challenges in physics. The additional energy loss due to NMM can significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the MESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He core mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical $Z = 1 Z_{\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\odot}$, and $\mu_v = 3 \times 10^{-12} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\sim 5\%$, and the TRGB luminosity increases by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However, contrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs earlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the additional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core, releases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the hydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass faster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak luminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and sub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency. We found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash can induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot region into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in NMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter the surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment effect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW mixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to effectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous construction of fast equator, poleward meridional flow, and near-surface shear layer in solar magnetohydrodynamic calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out an unprecedented high-resolution simulation for the solar convection zone. Our calculation reproduces the fast equator and near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of differential rotation and the near-surface poleward meridional flow simultaneously. The NSSL is located in a complex layer where the spatial and time scales of thermal convection are significantly small compared with the deep convection zone. While there have been several attempts to reproduce the NSSL in numerical simulation, the results are still far from reality. In this study, we succeed in reproducing an NSSL in our new calculation. Our analyses lead to a deeper understanding of the construction mechanism of the NSSL, which is summarized as: 1) rotationally unconstrained convection in the near-surface layer transports the angular momentum radially inward; 2) sheared poleward meridional flow around the top boundary is constructed; 3) the shear causes a positive kinetic $\langle v'_r v'_\theta\rangle$ and negative magnetic $\langle B_r B_\theta\rangle$ correlations; and 4) the turbulent viscosity and magnetic tension are latitudinally balanced with the Coriolis force in the NSSL. We emphasize the importance of the magnetic field in the solar convection zone.</description>

      <title>50 Dra: Am-type twins with additional variability in a non-eclipsing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between radiative diffusion, rotation, convection, and magnetism in metallic-line chemically peculiar stars is still not fully understood. Recently, evidence has emerged that these effects can work together. Our goal is to study the bright binary system 50 Dra, describe its orbit and components, and study additional variability. We conducted our analysis using TESS short-cadence data and new high-resolution spectroscopic observations. We disentangled the spectra using Korel and performed spectral synthesis with Atlas9 and Synthe codes. The system was modelled using Korel and Phoebe2.4. We also employed SED fitting in Ariadne and isochrone fitting using Param1.5 codes. Our findings indicate that the non-eclipsing system (with an inclination of 49.9(8) deg) 50 Dra, displaying ellipsoidal brightness variations, consists of two nearly equal A-type stars with masses of $M_{1}=2.08(8)$ and $M_{2}=1.97(8)$ M$_{\odot}$ and temperatures of 9800(100) and 9200(200) K, respectively. Our analysis also suggests that the system, with an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}=4.117719(2)$ days, is tidally relaxed with a circular orbit and synchronous rotation of the components. Furthermore, we discovered that both stars are metallic-line Am chemically peculiar stars with an underabundance of Sc and an overabundance of iron-peak and rare-earth elements. We identified additional variations with slightly higher frequency than the rotational frequency of the components that we interpret as prograde g-mode pulsations. The system 50 Dra exhibits numerous exciting phenomena that co-exist together and may have an impact on our understanding of chemical peculiarity and pulsations.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), the thermonuclear explosions of C/O white dwarf stars in binary systems, are phenomena that remain poorly understood. The complexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic diversity poses not only challenges for their understanding as astrophysical objects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes. Near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a promising avenue for studying the physics of SNeIa and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance estimations, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in peak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to a sample of SNeIa with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to identify the dominant components of their variability and constrain physical underlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen2006 are used for the physical interpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to describe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing and metallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some differences are found between the components of the NIR bands which may be attributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace. Additionally, the PCA components are compared to various light-curve parameters, identifying strong correlations between some components and peak brightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When applying PCA to NIR color curves, we found interesting correlations with the host-galaxy mass, where SNeIa with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in less massive galaxies. We also investigate the potential for improved standardization in the Y band by incorporating PCA coefficients as correction parameters, leading to a reduction in the scatter of the intrinsic luminosity of SNeIa.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is sometimes assumed that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection. As a theoretical basis, we employ the Gorbachev-Kel'ner-Somov-Shvarts (GKSS) model of formation of the magnetic null point, which is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb. Therefore, the topological ignition of magnetic reconnection should be interesting both by itself, as a novel physical phenomenon, and as a prognostic tool for forecasting the stealth CMEs and the resulting unexpected geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive UV and Optical spectral analysis of Cygnus X-1: Stellar and wind parameters, abundances, and evolutionary implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.</description>

      <title>Umbral oscillations in the photosphere. A comprehensive statistical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the global acoustic oscillations of the Sun's atmosphere can excite resonance modes within large-scale magnetic concentrations. These structures are conduits of energy between the different layers of the solar atmosphere, and understanding their dynamics can explain the processes behind coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. In this work, we studied the Doppler velocity spectrum of more than a thousand large-scale magnetic structures (i.e., sunspots) in the solar photosphere that crossed near the disk centre of the Sun. We exploited the excellent stability and seeing-free conditions of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to cover nearly seven years of observations, providing the most comprehensive statistical analysis of its kind. Here, we show that the power spectra of the umbra of sunspots in the photosphere is remarkably different from the one of quiet-Sun regions, with both exhibiting a primary peak at 3.3 mHz, but the sunspot umbrae also displaying a closely packed series of secondary peaks in the $4-6$~mHz band. Understanding the origin of such peaks is a challenging task. Here, we explore several possible explanations for the observed oscillations, all pointing toward a potential resonant interaction within these structures and an unknown driver. Our observational result provides further insight into the magnetic connectivity between the different layers of the dynamic atmosphere of the Sun.</description>

      <title>Fluorine abundances in CEMP stars at the lowest metallicity: Hints on the nature of the first stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the available measurements of fluorine abundance have increased significantly, providing additional information on the chemical evolution of our Galaxy and details on complex stellar nucleosynthesis processes. However, the observational challenges to obtain stellar F abundances favor samples with higher metallicities, resulting in a scarcity of measurements at low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt;-2.0$). We present F abundances and upper limits in 7 carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars observed with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), at the Gemini-South telescope. These new observations delivered high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, infrared spectra allowing us to probe significantly deeper into the metal-poor regime and the cosmic origin of F. This work presents the results of our observations, including two 2-sigma detections and five upper limits in a variety of CEMP stars. Arguably the most important result is for CS 29498-0043, a CEMP-no star at [Fe/H] = $-3.87$ with a F detection of [F/Fe] = $+2.0\pm 0.4$, the lowest metallicity star (more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than the next detection) with observed F abundance to date. This measurement allowed us to differentiate between two zero metallicity Population III (Pop III) progenitors: one involving He-burning with primary N in Wolf-Rayet stars, and the other suggesting H-burning during hypernova explosions. Our measured value is in better agreement with the latter scenario. This detection represents a pilot, and pioneering study demonstrating the power of F to explore the nature and properties of the first chemical enrichment from Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>A deep search for Complex Organic Molecules toward the protoplanetary disk of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed simultaneous V band photometry and spectroscopic observations of the recurrent nova T CrB and estimate the V band magnitude of the red giant. We find for the red giant of T CrB apparent and absolute V-band magnitudes m_V = 10.17 +/- 0.06 and M_V = +0.14 +/- 0.08, respectively. At the maximum of the ellipsoidal variation when these values are obtained, its absolute V-band magnitude is similar but fainter than the typical M4/5III giants.

      <title>A Data-constrained Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of Successive X-class Flares in Solar Active Region 13842 I. Dynamics of the Solar Eruption Associated with the X7.1 Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the initiation and the evolution of an X7.1-class solar flare observed in solar active region NOAA 13842 on October 1, 2024, based on a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. The nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic field about 1 hour before the flare was used as the initial condition for the MHD simulations. The NLFFF reproduces highly sheared field lines that undergo tether-cutting reconnection in the MHD simulation, leading to the formation of a highly twisted magnetic flux rope (MFR), which then erupts rapidly driven by both torus instability and magnetic reconnection. This paper focuses on the dynamics of the MFR and its role in eruptions. We find that magnetic reconnection in the pre-eruption phase is crucial in the subsequent eruption driven by the torus instability. Furthermore, our simulation indicates that magnetic reconnection also directly enhances the torus instability. These results suggest that magnetic reconnection is not just a byproduct of the eruption due to reconnecting of post-flare arcade, but also plays a significant role in accelerating the MFR during the eruption.</description>

      <title>Investigating an Erupting Metric-decimetric Radio Depression and its Physical Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a fascinating quiescent filament eruption on 2024 March 17 using data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART), with a combination of the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer. At the radio band, even though the filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became distinct and formed a continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption, i.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with the fragmentation of the erupting filament observed at the Ha and EUV bands, the radio depression appeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament eruption, it is suggested that the radio depression originates from the absorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the background emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Ha and EUV bands, thus leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the radio depression is also found to occupy the lower part but not the whole body of the flux rope.</description>

      <title>Extremely asymmetric bipolar magnetic field of the Bp star HD 57372</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fossil magnetic fields of early-type stars are typically characterised by symmetric or slightly distorted oblique dipolar surface geometries. Contrary to this trend, the late-B magnetic chemically peculiar star HD 57372 exhibits an unusually large rotational variation of its mean magnetic field modulus, suggesting a highly atypical field configuration. In this study, we present a Zeeman Doppler imaging analysis of HD 57372, revealing an exceptionally asymmetric bipolar magnetic topology, rarely observed in early-type stars. According to our magnetic field maps, reconstructed from the intensity and circular polarisation profiles of Fe, Cr, and Ti lines, approximately 66 per cent of the stellar surface is covered by a diffuse outward-directed radial field, with local field strengths reaching 11.6 kG, while the remaining 34 per cent hosts a highly concentrated inward-directed field with a strong horizontal component and a peak strength of 17.8 kG. These unusual surface magnetic field characteristics make HD 57372 a notable object for testing fossil-field theories and interpreting phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of early-type stars.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>

      <title>The slowest spinning Galactic-field spider PSR J1932+2121: A history of inefficient mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is discovering hundreds of new pulsars, including a slowly spinning compact binary millisecond pulsar (spin period $P_{\rm spin}=14.2$ ms) which showed radio eclipses and evidence of ablation of its companion: PSR J1932+2121. Its orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}=0.08$ d and the minimum companion mass is estimated as 0.12 $M_{\odot}$. Hence, this pulsar is classified as part of the Galactic-field spider (redback) population. However, it spins almost an order of magnitude slower than other Galactic-field spiders. Using detailed evolutionary calculations with MESA, we model the formation, mass-transfer and radio-pulsar phases, in order to explain the observed properties of PSR J1932+2121. We find that PSR J1932+2121 is a redback that has experienced an inefficient mass-transfer phase resulting in a lower accretion efficiency (in the range of 0.3 to 0.5) and subsequently slower spin compared to other spiders. We narrow down the initial range of $P_{\rm orb}$ that best reproduces its properties, to 2.0 to 2.6\,d. Current models of accretion-induced magnetic field decay are not able to explain its unusually high surface magnetic field of $2\times 10^{9}$ G. Hence, PSR J1932+2121 provides a unique opportunity to study inefficient accretion-induced spin up and surface magnetic field decay of pulsars.</description>

      <title>The Sunrise Ultraviolet Spectropolarimeter and Imager: Instrument description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third science flight of the balloon-borne solar observatory Sunrise carries three entirely new post-focus science instruments with spectropolarimetric capabilities, concurrently covering an extended spectral range from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Sampling a larger height range, from the low photosphere to the chromosphere, with the sub-arcsecond resolution provided by the 1-m Sunrise telescope, is key in understanding critical small-scale phenomena which energetically couple different layers of the solar atmosphere. The Sunrise Ultraviolet Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) operates between 309 nm and 417 nm. A key feature of SUSI is its capability to record up to several hundred spectral lines simultaneously without the harmful effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The rich SUSI spectra can be exploited in terms of many-line inversions. Another important innovation of the instrument is the synchronized 2D context imaging which allows to numerically correct the spectrograph scans for residual optical aberrations. In this work we describe the main design aspects of SUSI, the instrument characterization and testing, and finally its operation, expected performance and data products.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Study of the Dynamic Environment surrounding the FUor V960 Mon</title>

Abstract: The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.</description>

      <title>A mass invariant in a compressible turbulent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the measurable statistical properties of density fluctuations in a supersonic compressible turbulent flow is a major challenge in physics. In 1951, Chandrasekhar derived an invariant under the assumption of the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulent density field and stationarity of the background density. Recently, Jaupart &amp; Chabrier (2021) extended this invariant to non-isotropic flows in a time-evolving background and showed that it has the dimension of a mass. This invariant $M_{\rm inv}$ is defined by $M_{\rm inv} = \mathbb{E}(\rho)\text{Var}\left(\frac{\rho}{\mathbb{E}(\rho)}\right)(l_{\rm c}^\rho)^3$ where $\rho$ is the density field and $l_{\rm c}^\rho$ is the correlation length. In this article, we perform numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic compressible turbulence to test the validity of this invariant in a medium subject to isotropic decaying turbulence. We study several input configurations, namely different Mach numbers, injection lengths of turbulence and equations of state. We confirm that $M_{\rm inv}$ remains constant during the decaying phase of turbulence. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical model of the density field statistics which predicts without any free parameter the evolution of the correlation length with the variance of the logdensity field beyond the assumption of the gaussian field for the logdensity. Noting that $M_{\rm inv}$ is independent of the Mach number, we show that this invariant can be used to relate the non-gaussian evolution of the logdensity probability distribution function to its variance with no free parameters.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in Rotating Protoneutron Stars I: global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotation plays an important role in the evolution of most types of stars, in particular, it can have a strong influence on the evolution of a newly born proto-neutron star. In this study, we investigate the effects of rotation on four snapshots of the evolution of proto-neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in their cores, from birth as neutrino-rich objects to maturity as cold, catalyzed neutron stars. We focus on the effects of uniform rotation on the macroscopic structure of the star at three rotational frequencies -- 346.53 Hz, 716 Hz, and the Kepler frequency. Our investigation indicates that the impact of rotation at frequencies of $346.53$~Hz and $716$~Hz causes minor changes in the maximum gravitational mass but leads to significant changes in the stellar radius, particularly for stars with masses smaller than $2$~\msun. However, we observe drastic changes in the star's mass and radius when considering the Kepler frequency. In addition, we investigate other relevant characteristics of the rotating proto-neutron stars as they evolve such as the moment of inertia, compactness, central temperature, and Kerr parameter. Our results suggest that the inclusion of new degrees of freedom in the stellar core lead the star to be more sensitive to rotational dynamics, owing to an increase in compactness, a decrease in the central temperature, and a decrease in the moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-Based Detection of Anomalous Stokes V Spectra in the Flare-Producing Active Region 13663 Using Hinode/SP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting unusual signals in observational solar spectra is crucial for understanding the features associated with impactful solar events, such as solar flares. However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges, particularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process large volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these limitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V spectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an autoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly detection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within spectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May 5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly complex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in magnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy storage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are highly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in magnetogram images using current manual methods.</description>

      <title>Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO Filter Profile Service and photometric tools</title>

Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Stars II: Revisiting Bolometric Corrections</title>

Abstract: The development line of bolometric corrections within the brief history of photometry was described from the perspective of the Kuhnian philosophy of science. The luminous efficiency and heat index were two previous concepts to imply visual and bolometric brightness difference of a star, which was mainly suggested and used as auxiliary tools for calibrating stellar temperature scales before the term ``bolometric correction'' (BC) was also introduced for the same purpose by Kuiper in 1938, as $BC = M_{\rm bol} - M_{\rm V} = m_{\rm {bol}} - V$. Despite its ill-posed nature imposing no zero-point constant ($C_2=0$) for the BC scale and $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$, if $BC&gt;0$, $L_{\rm V}$ is unphysical, for the luminosity of a star from which ``BC of a star must always be negative,'' ``the bolometric magnitude of a star ought to be brighter than its $V$-magnitude,'' and ``the zero point of bolometric corrections are arbitrary'' (paradigms) were extracted. The newest of the first three definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century. Therefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be considered a prescience period. The rest could be named the normal science period in which astrophysicists work under the three paradigms. The rise of BC as a concept, how the ill-posed definition BC emerged/used, how inconsistencies (paradigms) of BC developed, and how the Resolution B2 of the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union imposing $C_{\rm bol} = 71.197\,425\,\ldots$ mag, and $C_2&gt;0$, for the zero-point constants of the $M_{\rm {Bol}}$ and BC scales resolve the long-lasting problems were discussed. Generalized new definition of BC implying $L_{\rm V}=L \times 10^\frac{({\rm BC}-C_2)}{2.5}$ were given to replace $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$.</description>

      <title>Adding further pieces to the synchronization puzzle: QBO, bimodality, and phase jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work builds on a recently developed self-consistent synchronization model of the solar dynamo which attempts to explain Rieger-type periods, the Schwabe/Hale cycle and the Suess-de Vries and Gleissberg cycles in terms of resonances of various wave phenomena with gravitational forces exerted by the orbiting planets. We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides of the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter excite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action of the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07 years, our main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period of 1.723 years. We show that this term excites dynamo vacillations with periods that are typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a general feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under the influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar activity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars. We also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180 degrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-yr beat period is rather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves and prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an alternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related data from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to optimal growth conditions.</description>

      <title>Dust in the wind of outbursting young stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful accretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic accretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation, wherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding centrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are crucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away from the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of magnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust contained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the thin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a realistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the local thermal ionization fraction. The disk evolves with the concurrent action of viscosity, self-gravity and magnetic disk winds. Results. The simulated disk displays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and frequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling the observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are over an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence. However, despite this increased dust content, the winds are still dust-depleted as the dust-to-gas ratio is about an order of magnitude lower than the canonical interstellar value of 0.01. The results of our numerical experiments are in general agreement with the available observational findings and they shed a light on the mechanism behind production of dusty winds during outbursting events in YSOs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on observing unstudied Galactic open clusters in the Ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range and analyzing their photometric data. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) enables us to precisely study known Galactic open clusters. We conducted observations using the 1.54-meter Danish Telescope (DK1.54) in Chile and the 2.15-meter telescope at the Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina, employing UV filters. Furthermore, we have collected available photometric and astrometric data for our observed clusters. We aim to estimate the reddening of Galactic open clusters using UV photometry. We applied isochrone fitting to determine the reddening of the clusters using well-known members. As a final result, we present the reddening values of 105 Galactic open clusters in the UV, as determined by our photometry.</description>
