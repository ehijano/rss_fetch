      <title>Limited Math: Aligning Mathematical Semantics with Finite Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical mathematical models used in the semantics of programming languages and computation rely on idealized abstractions such as infinite-precision real numbers, unbounded sets, and unrestricted computation. In contrast, concrete computation is inherently finite, operating under bounded precision, bounded memory, and explicit resource constraints. This discrepancy complicates semantic reasoning about numerical behavior, algebraic properties, and termination under finite execution.
  This paper introduces Limited Math (LM), a bounded semantic framework that aligns mathematical reasoning with finite computation. Limited Math makes constraints on numeric magnitude, numeric precision, and structural complexity explicit and foundational. A finite numeric domain parameterized by a single bound \(M\) is equipped with a deterministic value-mapping operator that enforces quantization and explicit boundary behavior. Functions and operators retain their classical mathematical interpretation and are mapped into the bounded domain only at a semantic boundary, separating meaning from bounded evaluation.
  Within representable bounds, LM coincides with classical arithmetic; when bounds are exceeded, deviations are explicit, deterministic, and analyzable. By additionally bounding set cardinality, LM prevents implicit infinitary behavior from re-entering through structural constructions. As a consequence, computations realized under LM induce finite-state semantic models, providing a principled foundation for reasoning about arithmetic, structure, and execution in finite computational settings.</description>

      <title>Generalised Quantifiers Based on Rabin-Mostowski Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce new generalised quantifiers which allow us to express the Rabin-Mostowski index of automata. Our main results study expressive power and decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) logic extended with these quantifiers. We study these problems in the realm of both $\omega$-words and infinite trees. As it turns out, the pictures in these two cases are very different. In the case of $\omega$-words the new quantifiers can be effectively expressed in pure MSO logic. In contrast, in the case of infinite trees, addition of these quantifiers leads to an undecidable formalism.
  To realise index-quantifier elimination, we consider the extension of MSO by game quantifiers. As a tool, we provide a specific quantifier-elimination procedure for them. Moreover, we introduce a novel construction of transducers realising strategies in $\omega$-regular games with monadic parameters.</description>

      <title>The Rezk Completion for Elementary Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of category theory in univalent foundations and the formalization thereof is an active field of research. Categories in that setting are often assumed to be univalent which means that identities and isomorphisms of objects coincide. One consequence hereof is that equivalences and identities coincide for univalent categories and that structure on univalent categories transfers along equivalences. However, constructions such as the Kleisli category, the Karoubi envelope, and the tripos-to-topos construction, do not necessarily give univalent categories. To deal with that problem, one uses the Rezk completion, which completes a category into a univalent one. However, to use the Rezk completion when considering categories with structure, one also needs to show that the Rezk completion inherits the structure from the original category. In this work, we present a modular framework for lifting the Rezk completion from categories to categories with structure. We demonstrate the modularity of our framework by lifting the Rezk completion from categories to elementary topoi in manageable steps.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for distant Bang calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximation semantics capture the observable behaviour of {\lambda}-terms, with B\"ohm Trees and Taylor Expansion standing as two central paradigms. Although conceptually different, these notions are related via the Commutation Theorem, which links the Taylor expansion of a term to that of its B\"ohm tree. These notions are well understood in Call-by-Name {\lambda}-calculus and have been more recently introduced in Call-by-Value settings. Since these two evaluation strategies traditionally require separate theories, a natural next step is to seek a unified setting for approximation semantics. The Bang-calculus offers exactly such a framework, subsuming both CbN and CbV through linear-logic translations while providing robust rewriting properties. However, its approximation semantics is yet to be fully developed. In this work, we develop the approximation semantics for dBang, the Bang-calculus with explicit substitutions and distant reductions. We define B\"ohm trees and Taylor expansion within dBang and establish their fundamental properties. Our results subsume and generalize Call-By-Name and Call-By-Value through their translations into Bang, offering a single framework that uniformly captures infinitary and resource-sensitive semantics across evaluation strategies.</description>

      <title>Random Models and Guarded Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on ideas of Gurevich and Shelah for the G\"odel Class, we present a new probabilistic proof of the finite model property for the Guarded Fragment of First-Order Logic. Our proof is conceptually simple and yields the optimal doubly-exponential upper bound on the size of minimal models. We precisely analyse the obtained bound, up to constant factors in the exponents, and construct sentences that enforce models of tightly matching size. The probabilistic approach adapts naturally to the Triguarded Fragment, an extension of the Guarded Fragment that also subsumes the Two-Variable Fragment. Finally, we derandomise the probabilistic proof by providing an explicit model construction which replaces randomness with deterministic hash functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study monitorable sets from a topological standpoint. In particular, we use descriptive set theory to describe the complexity of the family of monitorable sets in a countable space $X$. When $X$ is second countable, we observe that the family of monitorable sets is $\Pi^0_3$ and determine the exact complexities it can have. In contrast, we show that if $X$ is not second countable then the family of monitorable sets can be much more complex, giving an example where it is $ \Pi^1_1$-complete.</description>

      <title>Propositional Abduction via Only-Knowing: A Non-Monotonic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Hybrid MKNF for Aeronautics Applications: Usage and Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an Answer Set Programming (ASP)-based framework for medical appointment scheduling, aimed at improving efficiency, reducing administrative overhead, and enhancing patient-centered care. The framework personalizes scheduling for vulnerable populations by integrating Blueprint Personas. It ensures real-time availability updates, conflict-free assignments, and seamless interoperability with existing healthcare platforms by centralizing planning operations within an ASP logic model.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding an LLM-powered Theorem Prover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle</description>

      <title>Structural Indexing of Relational Databases for the Evaluation of Free-Connex Acyclic Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.</description>

      <title>Rule Rewriting Revisited: A Fresh Look at Static Filtering for Datalog and ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Composition of LTL Properties over Infinite and Finite Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of asynchronous software components poses significant challenges due to the way components interleave and exchange input/output data concurrently. Compositional strategies aim to address this by separating the task of verifying individual components on local properties from the task of combining them to achieve global properties. This paper concentrates on employing symbolic model checking techniques to verify properties specified in Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) on asynchronous software components that interact through data ports. Unlike event-based composition, local properties can now impose constraints on input from other components, increasing the complexity of their composition. We consider both the standard semantics over infinite traces as well as the truncated semantics over finite traces to allow scheduling components only finitely many times.
  We propose a novel LTL rewriting approach, which converts a local property into a global one while considering the interleaving of infinite or finite execution traces of components. We prove the semantic equivalence of local properties and their rewritten version projected on the local symbols. The rewriting is also optimized to reduce formula size and to leave it unchanged when the temporal property is stutter invariant. These methods have been integrated into the OCRA tool, as part of the contract refinement verification suite. Finally, the different composition approaches were compared through an experimental evaluation that covers various types of specifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09138v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Logic refines Intuitionnistic Logic by taking into account the resources used during the proof and program computation. In the past decades, it has been extended to various frameworks. The most famous are indexed linear logics which can describe the resource management or the complexity analysis of a program. From an other perspective, Differential Linear Logic is an extension which allows the linearization of proofs. In this article, we merge these two directions by first defining a differential version of Graded linear logic: this is made by indexing exponential connectives with a monoid of differential operators. We prove that it is equivalent to a graded version of previously defined extension of finitary differential linear logic. We give a denotational model of our logic, based on distribution theory and linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Weak Simplicial Bisimilarity and Minimisation for Polyhedral Model Checking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work described in this paper builds on the polyhedral semantics of the Spatial Logic for Closure Spaces (SLCS) and the geometric spatial model checker PolyLogicA. Polyhedral models are central in domains that exploit mesh processing, such as 3D computer graphics. A discrete representation of polyhedral models is given by cell poset models, which are amenable to geometric spatial model checking on polyhedral models using the logical language SLCS$\eta$, a weaker version of SLCS. In this work we show that the mapping from polyhedral models to cell poset models preserves and reflects SLCS$\eta$. We also propose weak simplicial bisimilarity on polyhedral models and weak $\pm$-bisimilarity on cell poset models, where by ``weak'' we mean that the relevant equivalence is coarser than the corresponding one for SLCS, leading to a greater reduction of the size of models and thus to more efficient model checking. We show that the proposed bisimilarities enjoy the Hennessy-Milner property, i.e. two points are weakly simplicial bisimilar iff they are logically equivalent for SLCS$\eta$. Similarly, two cells are weakly $\pm$-bisimilar iff they are logically equivalent in the poset-model interpretation of SLCS$\eta$. Furthermore we present a model minimisation procedure and prove that it correctly computes the minimal model with respect to weak $\pm$-bisimilarity, i.e. with respect to logical equivalence of SLCS$\eta$. The procedure works via an encoding into LTSs and then exploits branching bisimilarity on those LTSs, exploiting the minimisation capabilities as included in the mCRL2 toolset. Various examples show the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Medical Triage Optimization with Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a logic programming framework that orchestrates multiple variants of an optimization problem and reasons about their results to support high-stakes medical decision-making. The logic programming layer coordinates the construction and evaluation of multiple optimization formulations, translating solutions into logical facts that support further symbolic reasoning and ensure efficient resource allocation -- specifically targeting the "right patient, right platform, right escort, right time, right destination" principle. This capability is integrated into GuardianTwin, a decision support system for Forward Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), where rapid and explainable resource allocation is critical. Through a series of experiments, our framework demonstrates an average reduction in casualties by 35.75% compared to standard baselines. Additionally, we explore how users engage with the system via an intuitive interface that delivers explainable insights, ultimately enhancing decision-making in critical situations. This work demonstrates how logic programming can serve as a foundation for modular, interpretable, and operationally effective optimization in mission-critical domains.</description>

      <title>Effective Versions of Strong Measure Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective versions of strong measure zero sets are developed for various levels of complexity and computability. It is shown that the sets can be equivalently defined using a generalization of supermartingales called odds supermartingales, success rates on supermartingales, predictors, and coverings. We show Borel's conjecture of a set having strong measure zero if and only if it is countable holds in the time and space bounded setting. At the level of computability this does not hold. We show the computable level contains sequences at arbitrary levels of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy by proving a correspondence principle yielding a condition for the sets of computable strong measure zero to agree with the classical sets of strong measure zero. An algorithmic version of strong measure zero using lower semicomputability is defined. We show that this notion is equivalent to the set of NCR reals studied by Reimann and Slaman, thereby giving new characterizations of this set. Effective strong packing dimension zero is investigated requiring success with respect to the limit inferior instead of the limit superior. It is proven that every sequence in the corresponding algorithmic class is decidable. At the level of computability, the sets coincide with a notion of weak countability that we define.</description>

      <title>On the Realizability of Prime Conjectures in Heyting Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that no total functional can uniformly transform $\Pi_1$ primality into explicit $\Sigma_1$ witnesses without violating normalization in $\mathsf{HA}$. The argument proceeds through three complementary translations: a geometric interpretation in which compositeness and primality correspond to local and global packing configurations; a proof-theoretic analysis demonstrating the impossibility of uniform $\Sigma_1$ extraction; and a recursion-theoretic formulation linking these constraints to the absence of total Skolem functions in $\mathsf{PA}$. The formal analysis in constructive logic is followed by heuristic remarks interpreting the results in informational terms.</description>
