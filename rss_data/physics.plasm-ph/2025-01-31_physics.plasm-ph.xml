      <title>Deflection of Interferometry Beams due to Transverse Refractive Index Gradient in SST-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far Infrared interferometry is the main diagnostics method for electron density measurements in medium sized tokamaks. The transverse density gradients of plasma produce refractive effect, and the probing radiation does not propagate along a straight line and gets deflected. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the plasma effect on beam direction to verify if the used wavelength is compatible with the machine geometry. This paper presents the analytical results of refractive bending of THz beam due to transverse density gradients for circular and elliptical cross section plasma. The results from ray tracing integration to calculate refractive bending in D-shaped plasmas are also presented.</description>

      <title>The topology of non-resonant stellarator divertors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply topological methods to better understand how the magnetic field in the stellarator edge can be diverted away from the confined region. Our primary method is calculating the winding numbers of closed contours, which gives information on the number and nature of fixed points within a bounded region. We first apply this to the non-resonant divertor (NRD) Hamiltonian system, and present a simple explanation for the system's diversion: trajectories are guided away from the confined region by X-points which are "unpaired" i.e. do not have corresponding O-points and therefore do not resemble an island chain. We show how similar phenomena can occur in a similar, axisymmetric Hamiltonian system. Secondly, we find examples of neoclassically optimised stellarators in the QUASR database which divert the magnetic field via unpaired X-points. We present and discuss three examples, each containing novel phenomena which might be desirable for stellarator divertors. These findings broaden the horizons of how magnetic fields can be diverted in realistic stellarators, and may be attractive for future experiments and stellarator reactor design.</description>

      <title>Characterization of NBI-driven shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator using Mirnov probes and electrostatic potential fluctuation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform ($\iota/2\pi$) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfv\'en eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in $\iota/2\pi$, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\'en continuum for selected cases using \texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.</description>

      <title>Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodyanamic characteristics II: reflections on non-reflecting boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code LaRe3D. This implementation couples a characteristics-based boundary condition with a Lagrangian remap code, demonstrating the generality and flexibility of such non-reflecting boundary conditions for use with arbitrary grid-based MHD schemes. To test this implementation for perturbations on a background state, we present simulations of a hot sphere in an angled magnetic field. We then examine a series of simulations where we advect a spheromak through a non-reflecting boundary condition at four speeds related to the fast and slow magnetosonic speeds and the Alfven speed. We compare the behavior of these simulations to ground truth simulations run from the same initial condition on an extended grid that keeps the spheromak in the simulation volume at all times. We find that the non-reflecting boundary condition can lead to severe, physical differences developing between a simulation using a non-reflecting boundary and a ground truth simulation using a larger simulation volume. We conclude by discussing the origins of these differences.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show experimentally that an effect of motion of ions, observed in a plasma-based accelerator, depends inversely on the plasma ion mass. The effect appears within a single wakefield event and manifests itself as a bunch tail, occurring only when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, experimentally confirmed through variations in the drive bunch charge.</description>

      <title>Coupling Fluid Plasma and Kinetic Neutral Models using Correlated Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While boundary plasmas in present-day tokamaks generally fall in a fluid regime, neutral species near the boundary often require kinetic models due to long mean-free-paths compared to characteristic spatial scales in the region. Monte-Carlo (MC) methods provide a complete, high-fidelity approach to solving kinetic models, and must be coupled to fluid plasma models to simulate the full plasma-neutrals system. The statistical nature of MC methods, however, prevents the convergence of coupled fluid-kinetic simulations to an exact self-consistent steady-state. Moreover, this forces the use of explicit methods that can suffer from numerical errors and require huge computational resources. Correlated Monte-Carlo (CMC) methods are expected to alleviate these issues but have historically enjoyed only mixed success. Here, a fully implicit method for coupled plasma-neutral systems is demonstrated in 1D using the UEDGE plasma code and a homemade CMC code. In particular, it is shown that ensuring the CMC method is a differentiable function of the background plasma is sufficient to employ a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov solver for implicit time steps. The convergence of the implicit coupling method is explored and compared with explicit coupling and uncorrelated methods. It is shown that ensuring differentiability by controlling random seeds in the MC is sufficient to achieve convergence, and that the use of implicit time-stepping methods has the potential for improved stability and runtimes over explicit coupling methods.</description>

      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. In this work, we present a method for designing a differential pumping system, which we successfully implemented in our experiments. This enabled the first demonstration of continuous operation of a kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system effectively maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library.</description>

      <title>Steering laser-produced THz radiation in air with superluminal ionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that pulsed THz radiation produced in air by a focused ultrashort laser pulse can be steered to large angles or even in the backward direction with respect to the laser propagation axis. The emission angle is adjusted by the flying focus technique, which determines the speed and direction of the ionization front created by the single-color laser pulse. This easily adjustable THz source, being well separated from the intense laser, opens exciting applications for remote THz spectroscopy.</description>
