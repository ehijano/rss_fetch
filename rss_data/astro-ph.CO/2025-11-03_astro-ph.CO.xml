      <title>Universal numerical convergence criteria for subhalo tidal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.</description>

      <title>Can galactic magnetic fields diffuse into the voids?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids are magnetized at the level of at least $10^{-17}$ G on Mpc scales, as implied by blazar observations. We show that an electrically conducting plasma is present in the voids, and that, because of the plasma, \emph{diffusion} into the voids of galactic fields generated by a mean-field dynamo is far too slow to explain the present-day void magnetization. Indeed, we show that even in the presence of turbulence in the voids, dynamo-generated galactic fields diffuse out to a galactocentric radius of only 200-400 kpc. Therefore, it is challenging to meet the required volume filling-factor of the void magnetic field. We conclude that a primordial origin remains the most natural explanation to the space-filling weak fields in voids.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoders for cosmological model discrimination and anomaly detection in cosmic microwave background power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background power spectra are a primary window into the early universe. However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Galacticus and COZMIC WDM Subhalo Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of warm dark matter (WDM) subhalo populations generated by the semi-analytic model {\sc Galacticus} and the COZMIC suite of dark matter-only $N$-body simulations. Using a range of thermal relic WDM particle masses (3--10 keV), we examine key summary statistics -- including the subhalo mass function, spatial distribution, maximum circular velocity $V_\text{max}$, and its corresponding radius $ R_\text{max} $ -- to evaluate the consistency between these two modeling frameworks. Both models predict a suppression of low-mass subhalos correlated with decreasing WDM particle mass, and that WDM subhalos tend to have lower $V_\text{max} $ and larger $ R_\text{max} $ values than their CDM counterparts at fixed mass. While {\sc Galacticus} provides more statistically precise results due to a larger sample size, the COZMIC simulations display similar qualitative trends. We discuss how differences in halo finder algorithms, simulation resolution, and modeling assumptions affect subhalo statistics. Our findings demonstrate that {\sc Galacticus} can reliably reproduce WDM subhalo distributions seen in $N$-body simulations, offering a computationally efficient tool for exploring the implications of WDM across astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-photon coupling from the Global 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>First Cosmological Constraints from the Joint Analysis of Galaxy Clustering and the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first joint analysis of the galaxy clustering (GC) and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect to simultaneously constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters in this work, utilizing a combination of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) map and the Constant Stellar Mass (CMASS) galaxy sample. As a complementary probe to the galaxy density power spectrum, we incorporate the pairwise kSZ power spectrum detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N $\sim 7$) to derive constraints on cosmological parameters ($H_0 = 71.16^{+5.09}_{-5.50}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.276^{+0.086}_{-0.067}$, $w_0 = -0.971^{+0.236}_{-0.380}$) and the average optical depth of the galaxy sample ($\lg\bar{\tau} = -4.22 \pm +0.09$). Compared to the GC-only analysis, the joint analysis yields tighter constraints on these cosmological parameters: the Figures of Merits (FoMs) improve by 29.3%, 32.3% and 21.5% for the $H_0$--$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $H_0$--$w_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$--$w_0$ contours. For the first time, we demonstrate the complementary applicability of the kSZ effect in constrain cosmological parameters from real observational data.</description>

      <title>Reproducing Abell 2744 with the HyperMillennium Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Hyper Millennium (HM) simulation, an extremely large cosmological simulation designed to support next-generation galaxy surveys. The simulation follows 4.2 trillion dark matter particles in a comoving box of $2.5\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$, with a mass resolution of $3.2 \times 10^8\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and a force resolution of $3.0\ h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$. Its combination of scale and resolution is ideal for studying large-scale structures and rare cosmic objects. In this first paper of the HM project, we explore whether the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (A2744) can be reproduced in detail in the simulation. Pixel-based statistics of galaxy number density $N_{\rm gal}$, luminosity density $L_{\rm gal}$, and projected mass density $\kappa$ show excellent agreement between A2744 and its analogues down to $\sim 50\ {\rm kpc}$, once field-selection biases toward high galaxy surface density are accounted for. This concordance, achieved in one of the most extreme known galaxy environments, is a validation of the underlying $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model in the extreme regime of A2744 and showcases the robustness and accuracy of the HM simulation, which is capable of producing galaxy and mass catalogues of comparable quality out to high redshift across its full comoving volume of $45$ ${\rm Gpc^3}$.</description>

      <title>Earth-lens telescope for distant axion-like particle sources with stimulated backward reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond $\mathcal{O}(10),\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \ll M_\mathrm{Planck}$.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Systematic uncertainties from the halo mass conversion on galaxy cluster number count data analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large catalogues of galaxy clusters expected from the Euclid survey will enable cosmological analyses of cluster number counts that require accurate cosmological model predictions. One possibility is to use parametric fits calibrated against $N$-body simulations, that capture the cosmological parameter dependence of the halo mass function. Several studies have shown that this can be obtained through a calibration against haloes with spherical masses defined at the virial overdensity. In contrast, if different mass definitions are used for the HMF and the scaling relation, a mapping between them is required. Here, we investigate the impact of such a mapping on the cosmological parameter constraints inferred from galaxy cluster number counts. Using synthetic data from $N$-body simulations, we show that the standard approach, which relies on assuming a concentration-mass relation, can introduce significant systematic bias. In particular, depending on the mass definition and the relation assumed, this can lead to biased constraints at more than 2$\sigma$ level. In contrast, we find that in all the cases we have considered, the mass conversion based on the halo sparsity statistics result in a systematic bias smaller than the statistical error.</description>

      <title>Revealing cosmological fluctuations in 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: from maps to power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the integrated 21cm emission line from dark matter-tracing neutral hydrogen gas is the primary science goal for MeerKLASS (MeerKAT's Large Area Synoptic Survey). Prior to the arrival of MeerKAT, this intensity mapping technique had only been tested on a couple of pre-existing single-dish radio telescopes with a handful of observational hours with which to make early pioneering detections. The 64-dish MeerKAT array, precursor to the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), can scan the sky in auto-correlation mode and perform intensity mapping across large sky areas, presenting the exciting potential for a wide-sky (${\gtrsim}\,10{,}000\,{\rm deg}^2$) spectroscopic survey across redshift $0.4\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,1.45$. Validating the auto-correlation (or single-dish) mode of observation for a multi-dish array and developing the analysis pipeline with which to make unbiased measurements has presented major challenges to this endeavour. In this work, we overview the advances in the field that have facilitated a robust analysis framework for single-dish intensity mapping, and review some results that showcase its success using early MeerKLASS surveys. We demonstrate our control of foreground cleaning, signal loss and map regridding to deliver detections of cosmological clustering within the intensity maps through cross-correlation power spectrum measurements with overlapping galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future MeerKLASS observations and forecast its potential, making our code publicly available: https://github.com/meerklass/MeerFish.</description>

      <title>String-induced vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Production of Gravitational Waves from Preheating and Tachyonic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze GW production during preheating for an $\alpha$-attractor potential terminating in the positive-curvature regime, with energy transfer via $\phi\chi^{2}$. Linear Floquet analysis and nonlinear simulations show that $\phi$ fluctuations grow by parametric resonance, while $\chi$ undergoes tachyonic bursts. The GW spectrum features two peaks: a dominant low-frequency peak from the parametric channel and a subdominant high-frequency peak from the tachyonic channel. Redshifted to today, the peak reaches $h^{2}\Omega_{\rm GW}^{(0)} \sim 10^{-11}$ at $f^{(0)}_{p} \sim 10^{7}$ Hz. This multi-peak structure is a characteristic imprint of trilinear preheating in $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravity at Large Scales with kSZ-Reconstructed Velocities and CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for measuring the $E_G$ statistic that combines two CMB secondaries -- the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect and CMB lensing -- for the first time to probe gravity on linear scales. The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses. We construct a novel $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection significances in the range $S/N \sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$). In particular, the SO$\times$DESI LRG measurement would be able to distinguish between GR and certain modified gravity models, including Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and Chameleon theories, with high confidence. The proposed $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator opens up a new avenue for stress-testing gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM+GR model at the largest observable scales.</description>

      <title>Breaking Eternal Inflation: Empirical Viability of a Spontaneous Collapse Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit an inflationary scenario in which primordial inhomogeneities arise from a quantum collapse, a stochastic mechanism described in the context of quantum collapse theories in its continuous version and within semiclassical gravity. The predictions of the model show a non-conventional scalar spectrum governed by two new parameters in the collapse rate, whose aim is twofold: on one side, to account for the primordial cosmic structure, and on the other to explain the suppression amplitude associated with long-wavelength modes, thereby eliminating the occurrence of eternal inflation. Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\ell$ suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the Planck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other words, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the cosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario.</description>

      <title>Cosmological and High Energy Physics implications from gravitational-wave background searches in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O1-O4a runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations, primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered. We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>jFoF: GPU Cluster Finding with Gradient Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.</description>

      <title>On the adiabatic initial conditions for a particle gas in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>High$-z$ [OI] emission lines: ColdSIM simulations and ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at $63\mu$m and $145\mu$m are powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR) and H$_2$ content. Our predictions are compared with existing observations and new data analysed in this work. We post-process the outputs of the ColdSIM cosmological simulations with the DESPOTIC model, taking into account [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption by cold foreground material. A Random Forest algorithm is employed to accelerate computations and new observational ALMA data for galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 5-7$ are used to validate our model. Our predictions show significant [OI]$63\mu$m luminosities ($\approx 10^8\,\rm L_\odot$) for galaxies with SFRs of $\approx 10^2\,\rm M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The $145\mu$m line luminosity is typically $15 \%$ the [OI]$63\mu$m one and is a factor $\approx 2-20$ below high-$z$ observations. Both [OI] lines correlate with SFR and molecular mass, but exhibit flattening in scaling relations with metallicity and stellar mass. Foreground self-absorption reduces the [OI] flux by a factor of $2-4$, consistent with empirical corrections in observational studies. We find typical line ratios of [OI]$63\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $\approx 1$ and [OI]$145\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $ \approx 0.2 \, -$ consistent with $z\gtrsim 6$ observations, but only when [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption is included. Both [OI]$63\mu$m and [OI]$145\mu$m lines serve as tracers of star formation and molecular gas at high redshift. Their joint detection can provide constraints on the properties of the early interstellar medium and self-absorption of the [OI]$63\mu$m line.</description>

      <title>Detecting the IGM metal enrichment with the 2-point correlation function of the flux. Application to the UVES deep spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution and the abundance of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also "deabsorbed" the strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines associated with logN(HI)&gt;14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\sigma$, although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)&lt;14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak compatible with a metallicity of -3.80&lt;[C/H]&lt;-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data. However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when combining more than one line of sight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to $f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environment Around Black Holes From Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>

      <title>CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</description>

      <title>DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic isotropy with Gamma-ray bursts: A dipole and quadrupole analysis of BATSE and Fermi GBM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological principle, asserting large-scale homogeneity and isotropy, underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available, the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\sigma$ region of their respective null distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively. After incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections in cosmological anisotropy analyses.</description>

      <title>WallGo investigates: Theoretical uncertainties in the bubble wall velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find several $\mathcal{O}(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the $\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However, we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity and hence gravitational wave predictions.</description>

      <title>Testing inhomogeneous cosmography in our cosmic neighborhood using CosmicFlows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of the third order general cosmographic expansion of the luminosity distance is examined using several versions of a semi-realistic model of our local cosmic neighborhood, based on publicly available density and velocity fields from CosmicFlows-4. The study supports earlier findings that the general cosmographic expansion diverges at surprisingly low redshifts, often well before z = 0.1. By being based on a realistically placed observer within a data-informed cosmic environment, the results underscore that convergence must be a central concern when applying the general cosmographic expansion. By showing all-sky maps of kinematic parameters, the study also highlights the substantial information we lose when relying solely on standard FLRW-based cosmography.
  Poor convergence does not necessarily render the information extracted by fitting data to the general cosmographic expansion meaningless. Rather, it calls for caution in interpreting this information, particularly regarding the physical meaning of the fitting coefficients, the physical scales they probe and the implicit smoothing introduced by the fit.</description>

      <title>Probing large-scale structures with the two-point function and the power spectrum: insights into cosmic clustering evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe requires analyses of cosmic clustering and its evolution over time. In this work, we investigate the clustering properties of SDSS blue galaxies, which are excellent tracers of dark matter, along two distinct epochs of the Universe, utilizing estimators like the two-point angular correlation function (2PACF), the angular power spectra, among others. Considering a model-independent approach, we perform analyses in two disjoint redshift shells, $0 \leq z &lt; 0.06$ and $0.06 \leq z &lt; 0.12$, to investigate the distribution of large cosmic structures. Using Bayesian inference methods, we constrain the parameter that quantifies the galaxy clustering in the 2PACF, enabling us to perform comparisons among different regions on the sky and between different epochs in the Universe regarding the gravitational action on matter structures. Our analyses complement previous efforts to map large-scale structures in the Local Universe. In addition, this study reveals differences regarding the clustering of large cosmic structures comparing two epochs of the Universe, analyses done with diverse estimators. Results reveal, clearly, distinct evolutionary signatures between the two redshift shells. Moreover, we had the opportunity to test the concordance cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, computing the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at very small scales. Ultimately, all our analyses serve as a set of consistency tests of the concordance cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data, have found significant indication against the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This can also be interpreted as the significance of the detection of the $w_a$ parameter that measures variation of the dark energy equation of state. DESI's DR2 article quotes exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM for combinations of BAO and CMB data with each of three different and overlapping supernovae compilations (at 2.8-sigma for Pantheon+, 3.8-sigma for Union3, and 4.2-sigma for DESY5). We show that one can neither choose amongst nor average over these three different significances. We demonstrate how a principled statistical combination yields a combined exclusion significance of 3.1-sigma. Further we argue that, faced with these competing significances, the most secure inference from the DESI DR2 results is the 3.1-sigma level exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM obtained from combining DESI+CMB alone, omitting supernovae.</description>

      <title>FLRW Kinematic-Induced Measurement of the Hubble Constant from Cosmic Chronometer and Redshift Drift Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric embedding method that exploits the exact kinematic relation $\dot{z} = H_0(1 + z) - H(z)$ to transform redshift misalignment between Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Sandage-Loeb (SL) datasets into fundamental constraints in observable space. The approach recognizes that $H_0$ encodes the orientation of the FLRW observational plane defined by $(z, H(z), \dot{z})$ coordinates, enabling direct algebraic determination without parametric assumptions or interpolation schemes. Validation using available CC measurements and forecasted redshift drift data from FAST, CHIME, SKA, and ELT demonstrates 1.9\% precision for optimal data combinations, yielding $H_0 = 66.26 \pm 1.26$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while maintaining complete cosmological model independence. While no actual SL measurements currently exist, requiring us to rely on simulations for validation, our geometric constraints show superior resilience against sparse redshift coverage compared to Gaussian Process (GP) methods, which exhibit systematic biases and large uncertainties when datasets lack substantial overlap. This kinematic framework establishes geometric embedding as a robust tool for precision cosmological measurements, offering a fundamentally different approach to $H_0$ determination through pure observational analysis based on FLRW kinematic principles. The full potential of this method awaits implementation with real SL measurements from next-generation facilities.</description>

      <title>Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-27}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is stronger than the bounds derived from Planck (2018) data for mass $\lesssim 10~\rm GeV$.</description>

      <title>An iterative CMB lensing estimator minimizing instrumental noise bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise maps from CMB experiments are generally statistically anisotropic, due to scanning strategies, atmospheric conditions, or instrumental effects. Any mis-modeling of this complex noise can bias the reconstruction of the lensing potential and the measurement of the lensing power spectrum from the observed CMB maps. We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these instrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on correlations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we minimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases. In the regime of many independent splits, this maximum closely approximates the optimal MAP reconstruction of the lensing potential. In simulations, we demonstrate that this method is able to determine lensing observables that are immune to any noise mis-modeling with a negligible cost in signal-to-noise ratio. Our estimator enables unbiased and nearly optimal lensing reconstruction for next-generation CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Towards constraining cosmological parameters with SPT-3G observations of 25% of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The South Pole Telescope (SPT), using its third-generation camera, SPT-3G, is conducting observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in temperature and polarization across approximately 10 000 deg$^2$ of the sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ &lt; 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (&lt; 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 300 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data. The likelihood pipeline developed and used in this work is made publicly available online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination. We show, using a blind Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis, that it is possible to infer unbiased estimates of the primordial B-mode signal from ground-based observations of a small patch of sky even for highly complex foreground contamination. This work, originally performed in the context of configuration studies for a future CMB-S4 observatory, is highly relevant for the analysis of observations by the current generation of CMB experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis scenario by utilising the two-body decay of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) via an effective operator involving an axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) and a light chiral fermion $\nu_R$. This allows the two-body decay of heavy RHN into $\nu_R$ and ALP thereby generating a lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ which later gets transferred to left-handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left-handed leptons is then converted into baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. Successful leptogenesis constrain the parameter space in terms of RHN mass and axion decay constant. This has interesting consequences for both ALP and QCD axion DM parameter space within reach of several ongoing and near future experiments. We also propose a Dirac version of this scenario without any total lepton number violation. This leads to a long-lived asymmetric Dirac fermion contributing partially to DM thereby opening up more parameter space for ALP. In addition to axion search experiments, the proposed scenarios can have observable signatures at cosmic microwave background (CMB), DM search as well as terrestrial particle physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>
