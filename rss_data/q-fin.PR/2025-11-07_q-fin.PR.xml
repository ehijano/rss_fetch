      <title>On the Estimation of Own Funds for Life Insurers: A Study of Direct, Indirect, and Control Variate Methods in a Risk-Neutral Pricing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation under Solvency II is computationally intensive, relying on the estimation of own funds. Regulation mandates the direct estimation method. It has been proven that under specific assumptions, the indirect method results in the same estimate. We study their comparative properties and give novel insights.
  First, we provide a straightforward proof that the direct and indirect estimators for own funds converge to the same value. Second, we introduce a novel family of mixed estimators that encompasses the direct and indirect methods as its edge cases. Third, we leverage these estimators to develop powerful variance reduction techniques, constructing a single control variate from the direct and indirect estimators and a multi-control variate framework using subsets of the mixed family. These techniques can be combined with existing methods like Least-Squares Monte Carlo.
  We evaluate the estimators on three simplified asset-liability management models of a German life insurer, Bauer's model MUST and IS case from Bauer et al. (2006), and openIRM by Wolf et al. (2025). Our analysis confirms that neither the direct nor indirect estimator is universally superior, though the indirect method consistently outperforms the direct one in more realistic settings. The proposed control variate techniques show significant potential, in some cases reducing variance to one-tenth of that from the standard direct estimator. However, we also identify scenarios where improvements are marginal, highlighting the model-dependent nature of their efficacy.

      <title>Filtration Reduction and Completeness in Jump-Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing and hedging of derivatives in frictionless and competitive, but incomplete jump-diffusion markets. A unique equivalent martingale measure (EMM) is obtained using filtration reduction to a fictitious complete market. This unique EMM in the fictitious market is uplifted to the original economy using the notion of consistency. For pedagogical purposes, we begin with simple setups and progressively extend to models of increasing generality.</description>
