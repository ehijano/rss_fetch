      <title>Fluid ejections in nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From microscopic fungi to colossal whales, fluidic ejections are a universal and intricate phenomenon in biology, serving vital functions such as animal excretion, venom spraying, prey hunting, spore dispersal, and plant guttation. This review delves into the complex fluid physics of ejections across various scales, exploring both muscle-powered active systems and passive mechanisms driven by gravity or osmosis. We introduce a framework using dimensionless numbers to delineate transitions from dripping to jetting and elucidate the governing forces. Highlighting the understudied area of complex fluid ejections, this work not only rationalizes the biophysics involved but also uncovers potential engineering applications in soft robotics, additive manufacturing, and drug delivery. By bridging biomechanics, the physics of living systems, and fluid dynamics, this review offers valuable insights into the diverse world of fluid ejections and paves the way for future bioinspired research across the spectrum of life.</description>

      <title>Renal function changes in chronic hepatitis B patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best way to treat chronic hepatitis B is with pegylated interferon alone or with oral antiviral drugs. There is limited research comparing the renal safety of entecavir and tenofovir when used with pegylated interferon. This study will compare changes in renal function in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with pegylated interferon and either entecavir or tenofovir. The study included a cohort of 836 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who received treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN) either alone or in combination with entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF) between the years 2018 and 2021. Of these patients, 713 were included in a matched analysis comparing outcomes between those who were cured and those who were uncured, while 123 patients received IFN alone as a control group for comparison with the ETV and TDF treatment groups. The primary outcome measured was the change in renal function, specifically estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cystatin C (CysC), and inorganic phosphorus (IPHOS). Patients were categorized into stage 1 or stage 2 based on a baseline eGFR of less than 90 ml/min/m^2 Results: 125 CHB patients were matched 1:1 in both the combined treatment and cured groups. Baseline eGFR, CysC, and IPHOS levels were similar between the groups. Renal function in stage 1 and stage 2 groups showed a decreasing trend at 48 weeks after an initial increase.Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between changes in ALT and eGFR values at 12 weeks in both non-cured and cured groups. Conclusions: Over the 48-week duration of combined treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), it was found that both Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) and Entecavir (ETV) did not lead to an increase in renal injury.</description>

      <title>Drug resistance revealed by in silico deep mutational scanning and mutation tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As COVID-19 enters its fifth year, it continues to pose a significant global health threat, with the constantly mutating SARS-CoV-2 virus challenging drug effectiveness. A comprehensive understanding of virus-drug interactions is essential for predicting and improving drug effectiveness, especially in combating drug resistance during the pandemic. In response, the Path Laplacian Transformer-based Prospective Analysis Framework (PLFormer-PAF) has been proposed, integrating historical data analysis and predictive modeling strategies. This dual-strategy approach utilizes path topology to transform protein-ligand complexes into topological sequences, enabling the use of advanced large language models for analyzing protein-ligand interactions and enhancing its reliability with factual insights garnered from historical data. It has shown unparalleled performance in predicting binding affinity tasks across various benchmarks, including specific evaluations related to SARS-CoV-2, and assesses the impact of virus mutations on drug efficacy, offering crucial insights into potential drug resistance. The predictions align with observed mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the widespread use of the Pfizer drug has lead to viral evolution and reduced drug efficacy. PLFormer-PAF's capabilities extend beyond identifying drug-resistant strains, positioning it as a key tool in drug discovery research and the development of new therapeutic strategies against fast-mutating viruses like COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Early quantum computing applications on the path towards precision medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few years have seen rapid progress in transitioning quantum computing from lab to industry. In healthcare and life sciences, more than 40 proof-of-concept experiments and studies have been conducted; an increasing number of these are even run on real quantum hardware. Major investments have been made with hundreds of millions of dollars already allocated towards quantum applications and hardware in medicine. In addition to pharmaceutical and life sciences uses, clinical and medical applications are now increasingly coming into the picture. This chapter focuses on three key use case areas associated with (precision) medicine, including genomics and clinical research, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions. Examples of organizations and the use cases they have been researching are given; ideas how the development of practical quantum computing applications can be further accelerated are described.</description>

      <title>Assessing the distribution of cancer stem cells in tumorspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous theoretical research, we inferred that cancer stem cells (CSCs), the cells that presumably drive tumor growth and resistance to conventional cancer treatments, are not uniformly distributed in the bulk of a tumorsphere. To confirm this theoretical prediction, we cultivated tumorspheres enriched in CSCs, and performed immunofluorecent detection of the stemness marker SOX2 using a confocal microscope.
  In this article, we present a method developed to process the images that reconstruct the amount and location of the CSCs in the tumorspheres. Its advantage is the use of a statistical criterion to classify the cells in stem and differentiated instead of setting an arbitrary threshold. From the analysis of the results of the methods using graph theory and computational modeling, we concluded that the distribution of Cancer Stem Cells in an experimental tumorsphere is non-homogeneous. This method is independent of the tumorsphere assay being useful for analyzing images in which several different kinds of cells are stained with different markers.</description>

      <title>Possible and Impossible Inferences From Reconstructed Evolutionary Processes using Phylogenies as an Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of past evolutionary change is often based on reconstructions based on incomplete data, raising fundamental questions about the degree to which we can make reliable inferences about past evolutionary processes. This was demonstrated by Louca and Pennell (2020), who showed that each pure-birth process can be generated by an infinite number of birth-death processes. Here, I explore what it means to reconstruct past evolutionary change with three approaches from measure theory, group theory, and homotopy theory to better understand structural constraint and origins of (non)identifiability. As an example, the developed framework is applied to the case of birth-death processes.</description>

      <title>VQSynery: Robust Drug Synergy Prediction With Vector Quantization Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of optimizing cancer therapies is significantly advanced by the accurate prediction of drug synergy. Traditional methods, such as clinical trials, are reliable yet encumbered by extensive time and financial demands. The emergence of high-throughput screening and computational innovations has heralded a shift towards more efficient methodologies for exploring drug interactions. In this study, we present VQSynergy, a novel framework that employs the Vector Quantization (VQ) mechanism, integrated with gated residuals and a tailored attention mechanism, to enhance the precision and generalizability of drug synergy predictions. Our findings demonstrate that VQSynergy surpasses existing models in terms of robustness, particularly under Gaussian noise conditions, highlighting its superior performance and utility in the complex and often noisy domain of drug synergy research. This study underscores the potential of VQSynergy in revolutionizing the field through its advanced predictive capabilities, thereby contributing to the optimization of cancer treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Decoding Neuronal Networks: A Reservoir Computing Approach for Predicting Connectivity and Functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of analyzing electrophysiological measurements in neuronal networks. Our computational model, based on the Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) architecture, deciphers spatio-temporal data obtained from electrophysiological measurements of neuronal cultures. By reconstructing the network structure on a macroscopic scale, we reveal the connectivity between neuronal units. Notably, our model outperforms common methods like Cross-Correlation and Transfer-Entropy in predicting the network's connectivity map. Furthermore, we experimentally validate its ability to forecast network responses to specific inputs, including localized optogenetic stimuli.</description>

      <title>Nondestructive, quantitative viability analysis of 3D tissue cultures using machine learning image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascertaining the collective viability of cells in different cell culture conditions has typically relied on averaging colorimetric indicators and is often reported out in simple binary readouts. Recent research has combined viability assessment techniques with image-based deep-learning models to automate the characterization of cellular properties. However, further development of viability measurements to assess the continuity of possible cellular states and responses to perturbation across cell culture conditions is needed. In this work, we demonstrate an image processing algorithm for quantifying cellular viability in 3D cultures without the need for assay-based indicators. We show that our algorithm performs similarly to a pair of human experts in whole-well images over a range of days and culture matrix compositions. To demonstrate potential utility, we perform a longitudinal study investigating the impact of a known therapeutic on pancreatic cancer spheroids. Using images taken with a high content imaging system, the algorithm successfully tracks viability at the individual spheroid and whole-well level. The method we propose reduces analysis time by 97% in comparison to the experts. Because the method is independent of the microscope or imaging system used, this approach lays the foundation for accelerating progress in and for improving the robustness and reproducibility of 3D culture analysis across biological and clinical research.</description>

      <title>scDiffusion: conditional generation of high-quality single-cell data using diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are important for studying the laws of life at single-cell level. However, it is still challenging to obtain enough high-quality scRNA-seq data. To mitigate the limited availability of data, generative models have been proposed to computationally generate synthetic scRNA-seq data. Nevertheless, the data generated with current models are not very realistic yet, especially when we need to generate data with controlled conditions. In the meantime, the Diffusion models have shown their power in generating data at high fidelity, providing a new opportunity for scRNA-seq generation.
  In this study, we developed scDiffusion, a generative model combining diffusion model and foundation model to generate high-quality scRNA-seq data with controlled conditions. We designed multiple classifiers to guide the diffusion process simultaneously, enabling scDiffusion to generate data under multiple condition combinations. We also proposed a new control strategy called Gradient Interpolation. This strategy allows the model to generate continuous trajectories of cell development from a given cell state.
  Experiments showed that scDiffusion can generate single-cell gene expression data closely resembling real scRNA-seq data. Also, scDiffusion can conditionally produce data on specific cell types including rare cell types. Furthermore, we could use the multiple-condition generation of scDiffusion to generate cell type that was out of the training data. Leveraging the Gradient Interpolation strategy, we generated a continuous developmental trajectory of mouse embryonic cells. These experiments demonstrate that scDiffusion is a powerful tool for augmenting the real scRNA-seq data and can provide insights into cell fate research.</description>

      <title>SpanSeq: Similarity-based sequence data splitting method for improved development and assessment of deep learning projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of deep learning models in computational biology has increased massively in recent years, and is expected to do so further with the current advances in fields like Natural Language Processing. These models, although able to draw complex relations between input and target, are also largely inclined to learn noisy deviations from the pool of data used during their development. In order to assess their performance on unseen data (their capacity to generalize), it is common to randomly split the available data in development (train/validation) and test sets. This procedure, although standard, has lately been shown to produce dubious assessments of generalization due to the existing similarity between samples in the databases used. In this work, we present SpanSeq, a database partition method for machine learning that can scale to most biological sequences (genes, proteins and genomes) in order to avoid data leakage between sets. We also explore the effect of not restraining similarity between sets by reproducing the development of the state-of-the-art model DeepLoc, not only confirming the consequences of randomly splitting databases on the model assessment, but expanding those repercussions to the model development. SpanSeq is available for downloading and installing at https://github.com/genomicepidemiology/SpanSeq.</description>
