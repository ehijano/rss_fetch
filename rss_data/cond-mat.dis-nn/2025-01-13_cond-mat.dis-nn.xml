      <title>Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. We investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase on the Nishimori line becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. This result underscores the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. Furthermore, we argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These findings reveal fundamentally different properties of the ferromagnetic phase in models with correlation in disorder compared to those without.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the boson peak and first sharp diffraction peak in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson peak (BP) dynamics refers to the universal excitation in the terahertz region of glass. In this study, the universal dynamics of BP were quantitatively evaluated in various glassy materials based on the heterogeneous elasticity theory (HET), and the determinants of BP were successfully extracted. A strong correlation was observed between the maximum possible coarse-graining wavenumber, which is a determinant of the BP in the HET, and the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) wavenumber, which is a characteristic index of the medium-range order in glasses. The results indicate that the behaviour of BP in glass can be quantitatively understood in the following two steps. First, the FSDP representing the largest structural correlation in glass is dominantly used to determine the unit size of the elastic modulus heterogeneity, and second, the magnitude of the elastic modulus fluctuation is used to determine the frequency and intensity of the BP.</description>

      <title>Quantum Avalanches in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving Interacting Ising Majorana Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical works have revealed the instability of many-body localized (MBL) phase in disordered quantum many-body systems with finite system sizes and over finite timescales. This instability arises from Griffith regions that occur at the thermodynamic limit, which rapidly thermalize and affect the surrounding typical MBL regions, introducing an avalanche mechanism into the system. Here, we consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving interacting Ising Majorana chain model, which exhibits a more complex phase diagram, where an ergodic phase emerges between two MBL phases with different long-range order properties. We calculate the dynamic characteristics of the model when coupled to an infinite bath under perturbation, and through scaling behavior of the slowest thermalization rate, we find how critical disorder strengths in finite-size systems are affected by the avalanche mechanism. We also employe the embedded inclusion model and use the time evolution of mutual information between each spin and the artificial Griffith region to probe the diffusion of the thermal bubble. We observe that in finite-sized systems, the critical disorder strength gradually drifts away from the central. Our work demonstrate that both MBL paramagnetic phase and MBL spin-glass phase are unstable at finite sizes.</description>

      <title>Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum-entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, have become indispensable tools for modeling pairwise interactions in disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their remarkable success, these methods often overlook high-order interactions that may be crucial in complex systems. Conversely, while modern machine learning approaches can capture such interactions, existing interpretable frameworks are computationally expensive, making it impractical to assess the relevance of high-order interactions in real-world scenarios. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations via hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. Here, we present a method that maps RBMs exactly onto generalized Potts models with interactions of arbitrary high order. This approach leverages large-$N$ approximations, facilitated by the simple architecture of the RBM, to enable the efficient extraction of effective many-body couplings with minimal computational cost. This mapping also enables the development of a general formal framework for the extraction of effective higher-order interactions in arbitrarily complex probabilistic models. Additionally, we introduce a robust formalism for gauge fixing within the generalized Potts model. We validate our method by accurately recovering two- and three-body interactions from synthetic datasets. Additionally, applying our framework to protein sequence data demonstrates its effectiveness in reconstructing protein contact maps, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results position RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for investigating high-order interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent weight morphologies in deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether deep neural networks can exhibit emergent behaviour is not only relevant for understanding how deep learning works, it is also pivotal for estimating potential security risks of increasingly capable artificial intelligence systems. Here, we show that training deep neural networks gives rise to emergent weight morphologies independent of the training data. Specifically, in analogy to condensed matter physics, we derive a theory that predict that the homogeneous state of deep neural networks is unstable in a way that leads to the emergence of periodic channel structures. We verified these structures by performing numerical experiments on a variety of data sets. Our work demonstrates emergence in the training of deep neural networks, which impacts the achievable performance of deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Hexatic Phase in Covalent Two-Dimensional Silver Iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-crystal-like hexatic phase. While experiments have confirmed the KTHNY melting scenario in some 2D systems such as crystals of skyrmions and of noble gas atoms, no evidence has previously been found for it in covalently bonded 2D crystals. Here, 2D crystals of silver iodide embedded in multi-layer graphene are studied with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Near the melting point, a highly dynamic state of AgI emerges that we show to be the first observation of the hexatic phase in covalent 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Serpentine-like Organic Crystal Optical Waveguides for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical components and circuits that deal with multiple signal generation and processing are quintessential for artificial neural networks. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept four-layered organic optical artificial neural network (ANN)-like architecture, constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN), employing an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip-based mechanical micromanipulation technique. Initially, the strategic selection of four MPyIN crystal active waveguides of varying lengths, mechanically bending them into serpentine-like forms, followed by their hierarchical integration, creates neuron-like, four-layered interconnected optical waveguides with six optical synapses. The synapses in the ANN-like architecture enable parallel transmissions of passive optical signals via evanescent coupling across multiple paths through various layers of the serpentine-shaped optical waveguides. Notably, the feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to multiply and split the optical signal generated at any input into four diverging signals with varying magnitudes. Here, certain outputs deliver a mixed signal (passive and active) due to diverging and converging optical transmission paths. This hierarchical, ANN-like tiny architecture paves the way for the development of smart optical neural networks utilizing multiple emissive and phase-changing organic crystals.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Effect of shape anisotropy on percolation of aligned and overlapping objects on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the percolation transition of aligned, overlapping, anisotropic shapes on lattices. Using the recently proposed lattice version of excluded volume theory, we show that shape-anisotropy leads to some intriguing consequences regarding the percolation behavior of anisotropic shapes. We consider a prototypical anisotropic shape - rectangle - on a square lattice and show that for rectangles of width unity (sticks), the percolation threshold is a monotonically decreasing function of the stick length, whereas, for rectangles of width greater than two, it is a monotonically increasing function. Interestingly, for rectangles of width two, the percolation threshold is independent of its length. We show that this independence of threshold on the length of a side holds for d-dimensional hypercubiods as well for specific integer values for the lengths of the remaining sides. The limiting case of the length of the rectangles going to infinity shows that the limiting threshold value is finite and depends upon the width of the rectangle. This 'continuum' limit with the lattice spacing tending to zero only along a subset of the possible directions in d-dimensions results in a novel 'semi-continuum' percolation system. We show that similar results hold for other anisotropic shapes and lattices in different dimensions. The critical properties of the aligned and overlapping rectangles are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the threshold values given by the lattice-excluded volume theory are in good agreement with the simulation results, especially for larger rectangles. Our results show that shape-anisotropy of the aligned, overlapping percolating units has a marked influence on the percolation properties, especially when a subset of the dimensions of the percolation units are made to diverge.</description>

      <title>Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How neurons integrate the myriad synaptic inputs scattered across their dendrites is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. These non-linearities have motivated mathematical descriptions of single neuron as a two-layer computational units, which have been shown to increase substantially the computational abilities of neurons, compared to linear dendritic integration. However, current analytical studies are restricted to neurons with unconstrained synaptic weights and unplausible dendritic non-linearities. Here, we introduce a two-layer model with sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, and investigate its properties using both statistical physics methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dendritic non-linearity enhances both the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity. We characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We calculate analytically the distribution of synaptic weights in networks close to maximal capacity, and find that a large fraction of zero-weight ('silent' or 'potential') synapses naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses, as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. We test our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets and observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and the triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>
