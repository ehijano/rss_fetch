      <title>Functionality Determinants and Pore-level Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Approach for Water Permeation Rate in Aquaporins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquaporins play a key role for the regulation of water transport and solute selectivity in biological cells and tissues. Due to their unique properties, during the last years aquaporins (AQPs) have attracted increasing interest for their use in the development of biomimetic membranes for water filtration. Motivated by this fascinating application, and the need for reliable methodologies to rationalize the design of AQPs or other biomimetic molecules with targeted filtration properties, we conduct in this work an all-round analysis of their structural features to provide crucial insights into the key determinants of functionality of these relevant biomolecules. Particularly, we analyze -- on a selected set of experimentally-resolved AQP structures -- the composition and peculiarities of their NPA and Selectivity Filter (SF) motifs, the overall structural and sequence similarities between them, their pore shape and the residue-level pore-lining composition. Then, AQPs' pore structural and physico-chemical descriptors are put into correlation with available data on experimental permeation rate, within the context of a pore-level QSAR modeling. The approach, presented here as a methodological proof of concept, enables the identification of key -- potentially novel -- features related to water permeability, which could contribute to a deeper residue-level understanding of AQP filtering properties. Potential beneficiary areas include the rational design of optimized AQP-based biomimetic membranes and research into the molecular mechanisms underlying AQP-related diseases.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Transferable Molecular Conformational Ensemble Generation with Walk-Jump Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both to understanding protein function, and for drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</description>
