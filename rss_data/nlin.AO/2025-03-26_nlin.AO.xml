      <title>Hierarchical Loop Stabilization in Periodically Driven Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.</description>

      <title>The Misinterpretable Evidence Conveyed by Arbitrary Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence Theory is a mathematical framework for handling imprecise reasoning in the context of a judge evaluating testimonies or a detective evaluating cues, rather than a gambler playing games of chance. In comparison to Probability Theory, it is better equipped to deal with ambiguous information and novel possibilities. Furthermore, arrival and evaluation of testimonies implies a communication channel.
  This paper explores the possibility of employing Evidence Theory to represent arbitrary communication codes between and within living organisms. In this paper, different schemes are explored for living organisms incapable of anticipation, animals sufficiently sophisticated to be capable of extrapolation, and humans capable of reading one other's minds.</description>

      <title>Stem-cell differentiation underpins reproducible morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphogenesis of complex body shapes is reproducible despite the noise inherent in the underlying morphogenetic processes. However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. Strikingly, reproducible morphologies had also evolved stem-cell systems. We show that reproducibility is caused by a morphogenetic division of labour based on these stem-cell systems, where moving, dividing stem cells ``shape'' morphologies and irreversibly differentiate into stationary, non-dividing cells. These results suggest that stem-cell systems observed in natural development play fundamental roles in morphogenesis in addition to their known role of producing specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of stem-cell systems has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>
