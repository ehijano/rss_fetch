      <title>Algebras of Interaction and Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of cooperation and interaction are usually studied in the context of real or complex vector spaces. Additional insight, however, is gained when such systems are represented in vector spaces with multiplicative structures, i.e., in algebras. Algebras, on the other hand, are conveniently viewed as polynomial algebras. In particular, basic interpretations of natural numbers yield natural polynomial algebras and offer a new unifying view on cooperation and interaction. For example, the concept of Galois transforms and zero-dividends of cooperative games is introduced as a nonlinear analogue of the classical Harsanyi dividends. Moreover, the polynomial model unifies various versions of Fourier transforms. Tensor products of polynomial spaces establish a unifying model with quantum theory and allow to study classical cooperative games as interaction activities in a quantum-theoretic context.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of BiHom-Associative Trialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns the cohomology of (multiplicative) BiHom-associative trialgebras. We first detail the correspondence between central extensions and second cohomology. This is followed by a general cohomology theory that unifies those of BiHom-associative algebras and associative trialgebras. Finally, we introduce one-parameter formal deformations and classify generalized $\alpha\beta$-derivations of 3-dimensional BiHom-associative trialgebras.</description>

      <title>Characterization of vector spaces by isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vector space is commonly defined as a set that satisfies several conditions related to addition and scalar multiplication. However, for beginners, it may be hard to immediately grasp the essence of these conditions. There are probably a fair number of people who have wondered if these conditions could be substituted with ones that seem more straightforward. This paper presents a simple characterization of a finite-dimensional vector space, using the concept of an isomorphism, aimed at readers with a fundamental understanding of linear algebra. An intuitive way to understand an $N$-dimensional vector space would be to perceive it as a set (equipped with addition and scalar multiplication) that is isomorphic to the set of all column vectors with $N$ components. The method proposed in this paper formalizes this intuitive understanding in a straightforward manner. This method is also readily extendable to infinite-dimensional vector spaces. While this perspective may seem trivial to those familiar with algebra, it may be useful for those who have just started learning linear algebra and are contemplating the above question. Moreover, this approach can be generalized to free semimodules over a semiring.</description>

      <title>On a general notion of a polynomial identity and codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>

      <title>Skew bracoids and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew braces provide an algebraic framework for studying bijective nondegenerate solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We show that left skew bracoids, recently introduced by two of the authors, can be used to obtain right nondegenerate solutions, and give a variety of examples arising from various methods of constructing left skew bracoids. We compare the solutions we obtain with the left nondegenerate solutions obtained via (left cancellative) left semibraces, and establish a correspondence between left semibraces and a class of left skew bracoids.</description>

      <title>Leavitt Path Algebras of Quantum Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting a recent work of Brannan et al., on extending graph $C^*$-algebras to Quantum graphs, we introduce "Quantum Quivers" as an analogue of quivers where the edge and vertex set has been replaced by a $C^*$-algebra and the maps between the sets by $*$-homomorphisms. Additionally, we develop the theory around these structures and construct a notion of Leavitt path algebra over them and also compute the monoid of finitely generated projective modules over this class of algebras.</description>

      <title>Skew Axial Algebras of Monster Type II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our first paper, we looked at $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type with skew axet $X'(1+2)$. We continue our work by focusing on larger skew axets and classifying all such algebras with skew axets. This brings us one step closer to a complete classification of all $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>Mutation of signed valued quivers and presentations of simple complex Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a signed variant of (valued) quivers and a mutation rule that generalizes the classical Fomin-Zelevinsky mutation of quivers. To any signed valued quiver we associate a matrix that is a signed analogue of the Cartan counterpart appearing in the theory of cluster algebras. From this matrix, we construct a Lie algebra via a "Serre-like" presentation.
  In the mutation Dynkin case, we define root systems using the signed Cartan counterpart and show compatibility with mutation of roots as defined by Parsons. Using results from Barot-Rivera and P\'erez-Rivera, we show that mutation equivalent signed quivers yield isomorphic Lie algebras, giving presentations of simple complex Lie algebras.</description>
