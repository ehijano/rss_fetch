      <title>Observed abundance of X-ray low surface brightness clusters in optical, X-ray, and SZ selected samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comparison of the properties of galaxy cluster samples selected using observations in different wavebands may shed light on potential biases of the way in which the samples are assembled. For this comparison, we introduce a new observable that does not require previous knowledge of the cluster mass: the X-ray mean surface brightness within the central 300 kpc. We found that clusters with low surface brightness, defined as those with a mean surface brightness below 43.35 \subr , are about one quarter of the whole cluster population in a sample of 32 clusters in the nearby Universe, selected independently of the intracluster medium properties. Almost no example of a low central surface brightness cluster exists instead in two X-ray selected samples, one sample based on XMM-Newton XXL-100 survey data and the other on full-depth eROSITA eFEDS data, although these clusters are known to exist in the range of redshift and mass as probed by these two surveys. Furthermore, the Sunayev-Zeldovich Atacama Cosmology Telescope cluster survey is even more selective than the previous two samples because it does not even include clusters with intermediate surface brightness, which are instead present in X-ray selected samples that explore the same volume of the Universe. Finally, a measure of the mean surface brightness, which is obtained without knowledge of the mass, proves to be effective in narrowing the number of clusters to be followed-up because it recognizes those with a low gas fraction or with a low X-ray luminosity for their mass. Identifying these would otherwise require knowledge of the mass for all clusters.</description>

      <title>IGM damping wing constraints on the tail end of reionisation from the enlarged XQR-30 sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attenuation of Ly$\alpha$ photons by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\gtrsim5$ continues to be a powerful probe for studying the epoch of reionisation. Given a framework to estimate the intrinsic (true) Ly$\alpha$ emission of high-$z$ sources, one can infer the ionisation state of the IGM during reionisation. In this work, we use the enlarged XQR-30 sample of 42 high-resolution and high-SNR QSO spectra between $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.6$ obtained with VLT/X-Shooter to place constraints on the IGM neutral fraction. This is achieved using our existing Bayesian QSO reconstruction framework which accounts for uncertainties such as the: (i) posterior distribution of predicted intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles (obtained via covariance matrix reconstruction of the Ly$\alpha$ and N V emission lines from unattenuated high-ionisation emission line profiles; C IV, Si IV + O IV] and C III]) and (ii) distribution of ionised regions within the IGM using synthetic damping wing profiles drawn from a $1.6^3$ Gpc$^3$ reionisation simulation. Following careful quality control, we used 23 of the 42 available QSOs to obtain constraints/limits on the IGM neutral fraction during the tail-end of reionisation. Our median and 68th percentile constraints on the IGM neutral fraction are: $0.20\substack{+0.14\\-0.12}$ and $0.29\substack{+0.14\\-0.13}$ at $z = 6.15$~and 6.35. Further, we also report 68th percentile upper-limits of $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{H\,{\scriptscriptstyle I}}} &lt; 0.21$, 0.20, 0.21 and 0.18 at $z = 5.8, 5.95, 6.05$~and 6.55. These results imply reionisation is still ongoing at $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.55$, consistent with previous results from XQR-30 (dark fraction and Ly$\alpha$ forest) along with other observational probes considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

      <title>Detecting Galaxy Groups and AGNs populating the local Universe in the eROSITA era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eROSITA will deliver an unprecedented volume of X-ray survey observations, 20-30 times more sensitive than ROSAT in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) and for the first time imaging in the hard band (2-10 keV) including galaxy clusters and groups along with obscured and unobscured AGNs. This calls for a powerful theoretical effort to control the systematics and biases that may affect the data analysis. We investigate the detection technique and selection effects in the galaxy group and AGN populations of a mock eROSITA survey at the depth of eRASS:4. We create a $30\times 30$ deg$^{2}$ mock observation based on the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder within z=0-0.2. We combine a physical background extracted from the real eFEDS background analysis with realistic simulations of X-ray emission for the hot gas, AGNs and X-ray binaries. We apply a detection procedure equivalent to the reduction done on eRASS data and evaluate the completeness and contamination to reconstruct the luminosity functions of the extended and point sources in the catalogue. We assess the completeness of extended detections as a function of the input X-ray flux and halo. We achieve full recovery of the brightest (most massive) clusters and AGNs. However, a significant fraction of galaxy groups remains undetected. Examining the gas properties between the detected and undetected galaxy groups at fixed halo mass, we observe that the detected population exhibits, on average, higher X-ray brightness compared to the undetected ones. Moreover, we find that X-ray luminosity primarily correlates with the hot gas fraction, rather than temperature or metallicity. Our simulation suggests the presence of a systematic selection effect in current surveys, resulting in X-ray survey catalogues predominantly composed of the lowest-entropy, gas-richest, and highest surface brightness halos on galaxy group scales.</description>

      <title>Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx -1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective, both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g., Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 - 0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$) could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact, performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <title>Conversion-driven leptogenesis: A testable theory of dark matter and baryogenesis at the electroweak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry pose two of the most pressing questions in today's fundamental physics. Conversion-driven freeze-out has emerged as a successful mechanism to generate the observed dark matter relic density. It supports thermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings aligning with the null results from direct and indirect detection experiments. In this letter, we demonstrate that the departure from equilibrium of dark matter, induced by semi-efficient conversions, satisfies Sakharov's conditions, providing a novel explanation for both dark matter and the baryon asymmetry. Specifically, for a leptophilic model, we establish the mechanism of conversion-driven leptogenesis. The scenario predicts dark matter masses close to the electroweak scale offering testable predictions, such as soft displaced leptons at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Lighten up Primordial Black Holes in the Galaxy with the QCD axion: Signals at the LOFAR Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the luminosity that results from the conversion of QCD axion particles into photons in the magnetic field of the plasma accreting onto black holes (BHs). For the luminosities to be large two conditions need to be met: i) there are large numbers of axions in the PBH surroundings as a result of the so-called superradiant instability; ii) there exists a point inside the accreting region where the plasma and axion masses are similar and there is resonant axion-photon conversion. For BHs accreting from the interstellar medium in our galaxy, the above conditions require the black hole to have subsolar masses and we are therefore led to consider a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the conservative window, where we stay within the non-relativistic behavior of the plasma and neglect the possibility of non-linear enhancement via magnetic stimulation, the typical frequencies of the emitted photons lie on the low-radio band. We thus study the prospects for detection using the LOFAR telescope, assuming the PBH abundance to be close to the maximal allowed by observations. We find that for PBH and QCD axion with masses in the range $10^{-5}-10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ and $4 \times 10^{-8}$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ eV, respectively, the flux density emitted by the closest PBH, assuming it accretes from the warm ionized medium, can be detected at the LOFAR telescope. Coincidently, the PBH mass range coincides with the range that would explain the microlensing events found in OGLE. This might further motivate a dedicated search of these signals in the LOFAR data and other radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>First results from the Axion Dark-Matter Birefringent Cavity (ADBC) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are strongly motivated dark matter candidates that are the subject of many current ground based dark matter searches. We present first results from the Axion Dark-Matter Birefringent Cavity (ADBC) experiment, which is an optical bow-tie cavity probing the axion-induced birefringence of electromagnetic waves. Our experiment is the first optical axion detector that is tunable and quantum noise limited, making it sensitive to a wide range of axion masses. We have iteratively probed the axion mass range 40.9-43.3$\text{ neV/c}^2$, 49.3-50.6$\text{ neV/c}^2$, and 54.4-56.7$\text{ neV/c}^2$, and found no dark matter signal. On average, we constrain the ALP-photon coupling at the level $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \leq 1.9\times 10^{-8} \text{ GeV}^{-1}$. We also present prospects for future axion dark matter detection experiments using optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Disentangling gamma-beta: the 4th-order velocity moments based on spherical Jeans analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing a core and a cusp within dark matter halos is complexified by the existence of mass-anisotropy degeneracy, where various combinations of velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) and inner density slope ($\gamma$) yield similar observational signatures. We construct a dynamical model that incorporates the 4th-order velocity moments to alleviate this challenge. The inclusion of the 4th-order velocity moments enables stars' line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) to be flexible. This flexible LOSVD can cover from a thin-tailed to a heavy-tailed distribution that is inaccessible if only the 2nd-order moments are considered. We test our dynamical model using mock galaxies and find that a ratio of the global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the mock galaxy to the velocity error measurement $\sigma_{\mathrm{los,global}} / \Delta v_{\mathrm{los}} \gtrsim 4$ is required to avoid obtaining systematically biased results. This bias arises from the strong dependency of the 4th-order moments on the LOSVD tails, and not even increasing the sample size to $10^4$ stars can mitigate this effect. In that velocity ratio, $\beta$ is recovered within $\sim 1 \sigma$ even when the sample size is only 500 stars, regardless of the recovery of the other parameters. However, the estimation of $\gamma$ varies, depending on the degree to which LOSVDs deviate from Gaussianity. Because of the more significant change in its LOSVDs, a cored dark halo is more likely to be identified than a cusp.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of Barrow cosmology with LISA standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Barrow cosmological model, which proposes that quantum gravity effects create a complex, fractal structure for the universe's apparent horizon. We leverage the thermodynamics - gravity conjecture. By applying the Clausius relation to the apparent horizon of the Friedmann - Lema\^itre - Robertson - Walker universe within this framework, we derive modified field equations where the Barrow entropy is linked to the horizon. We assess the Barrow cosmology against current observations - cosmic microwave background , supernovae , and baryon acoustic oscillations data - and include projections for future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) standard sirens (SS). Our numerical results suggest a modest improvement in the Hubble tension for Barrow cosmology with phantom dark energy behavior, compared to the standard cosmological model. Furthermore, incorporating simulated LISA SS data alongside existing observational constraints tightens the limitations on cosmological parameters, particularly the deformation exponent.</description>

Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. \cite{Oppenheim:2024rcp}, in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has two basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, and (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics. We also mention other potential problems that might arise from stochastic gravitational behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the realization of nonminimally coupled Higgs inflation in the context of no-scale supergravity, investigates the formation of primordial black holes, and examines the potential for observable proton decay within the framework of the R-symmetric $SU(5)$ model. For inflation, both single and multifield scenarios are investigated. The prediction of the single-field model for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is approximately $10^{-3}$, and the scalar spectral index falls within Plank's 1$\sigma$ range. The running of the scalar spectral index, $-{dn_{s}}/{d\ln{k}}$, is approximately $10^{-4}$. A realistic scenario of reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis is employed with reheat temperature $T_r\sim10^9$ GeV. In the multifield case, we mainly focus on Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Gravitational Waves (GWs). In this inflationary framework, we demonstrate how a suitable choice of parameters can result in an enhanced scalar power spectrum, leading to the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) capable of fully accounting for dark matter. We also show that this scenario leads to Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW) which can be detected in current and future GW detectors. We explore different proton decay channels to look for observable predictions for the next-generation proton decay experiments Hyper-K and DUNE consistent with gauge coupling unification and cosmological bounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral distortions from promising single and multifield inflationary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13071</link>

Abstract: Forthcoming missions probing the absolute intensity of the CMB are expected to be able to measure spectral distortions, which are deviations from its blackbody distribution. As cosmic inflation can induce spectral distortions, these experiments offer a possibility to further test the various promising inflationary proposals, whose predictions need to be carefully determined. After numerically fitting all inflationary observables to match current observations, we compute the predicted spectral distortions of various promising single and multifield inflationary models. The predictions of single-field inflationary models display deviations between 0.5% and 20% with respect to the standard cosmological model in the observable window, where multi-natural and axion-monodromy inflation stand out in this respect. In the case of multifield inflation, we observe a richer structure of the power spectrum, which, in the case of so-called hybrid attractors, yields spectral distortions about 100 times more intense than the standard signal. These observations open up questions about the relation among our results and other cosmological observables that are also to be probed soon, such as the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Ultralight vector dark matter, anisotropies and cosmological adiabatic modes</title>

Abstract: In this work we study the early time behavior and the background evolution of ultralight vector dark matter. We present a model for vector dark matter in an anisotropic Bianchi type I universe. Vector fields source anisotropies in the early universe characterized by a shear tensor which rapidly decays once the fields start oscillating, making them viable dark matter candidates. We present the set of equations needed to evolve scalar cosmological perturbations in the linear regime, both in synchronous gauge and Newtonian gauge. We show that the shear tensor has to be taken into account in the calculation of adiabatic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A comparison between axion-like and power law potentials in cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the scalar field dynamics in axion-like and power law potentials for both positive and negative values of the exponents. We find that, for positive exponents, both the potentials exhibit similar scalar field dynamics and it can be difficult to distinguish them at least at the background level. Even though the potentials are oscillatory in nature for positive exponents scaling solutions can be achieved for larger values of the exponent for which the dynamics can be different during early times. Because of the presence of this scaling nature there is a turnaround in the values of the scalar field equation of state as we increase the values of the exponent in both the potentials. This indicates the deviation from the oscillatory behaviour for the larger values of the exponent. For negative values of the exponent, the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable and axion-like potential can give rise to cosmologically viable tracker solutions unlike the power law potentials. For negative values of the exponent, axion-like potential can behave like a cosmological constant around its minima and the dark energy scale can be related to the potential scale. Due to the cosmological constant like behavior of the axion-like potential for negative exponent around its minima the late time dynamics can be similar to $\Lambda$CDM and we get similar observational constraint on the parameters for both $\Lambda$CDM and axion-like potential with negative exponent. So, while for positive exponents we may not distinguish the two potentials for negative exponents the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on early dark energy from the full shape analysis of eBOSS DR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of Early Dark Energy (EDE) in addressing the Hubble tension using data from the completed eBOSS survey, focusing on luminous red galaxies (LRGs), quasars (QSOs), and emission line galaxies (ELGs). We perform cosmological parameter measurements based on full shape analysis of the power spectrum of all three tracers. We conduct this full shape analysis with the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS). EDE is known to strongly suffer from volume projection effects, which makes the interpretation of cosmological constraints challenging. To quantify the volume projection effects within an EDE full shape analysis, we explore the impact of different prior choices on the nuisance parameters of EFTofLSS through an extensive mock study. We compare classical Gaussian priors to the non-informative Jeffreys prior, known to mitigate volume projection effects in $\Lambda$CDM. Our full shape analysis combines eBOSS and BOSS data with Planck, external Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), PantheonPlus, and SH0ES supernova data. EDE demonstrates to reduce the tension from $5.2\sigma$ to $3\sigma$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The derived values at a 68\% credible interval with Gaussian and Jeffreys priors are $H_0=71.73_{-0.86}^{+0.82}$ km/s/Mpc with $f_\mathrm{EDE} = 0.1179_{-0.022}^{+0.025}$ and $H_0=72.03_{-0.87}^{+0.82}$ km/s/Mpc with $f_\mathrm{EDE} = 0.1399_{-0.022}^{+0.023}$, respectively. Although the Hubble tension is mitigated compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the inclusion of eBOSS data amplifies the tension within EDE from $2\sigma$ to $3\sigma$, in contrast to the full shape analysis of BOSS data with Planck, external BAO, PantheonPlus, and SH0ES. This highlights the significance of incorporating additional large-scale structure data in discussions concerning models aiming to resolve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>FLAME: Fitting Lyman-alpha Absorption lines using Machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FLAME, a machine learning algorithm designed to fit Voigt profiles to HI Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption lines using deep convolutional neural networks. FLAME integrates two algorithms: the first determines the number of components required to fit Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, and the second calculates the Doppler parameter $b$, the HI column density N$_{\rm HI}$, and the velocity separation of individual components. For the current version of FLAME, we trained it on low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forests observed with the Far Ultraviolet gratings of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Drawing on this data, we trained FLAME on $\sim$ $10^6$ simulated Voigt profiles, forward-modeled to Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines observed with HST-COS, to classify lines as either single or double components and then determine Voigt profile fitting parameters. FLAME shows impressive accuracy on the simulated data by identifying more than 98% (90%) of single (double) component lines. It determines $b$ values within $\approx \pm{8}~(15)$ km s$^{-1}$ and log $N_{\rm HI}/ {\rm cm}^2$ values within $\approx \pm 0.3~(0.8)$ for 90% of the single (double) component lines. However, when applied to real data, FLAME's component classification accuracy drops by $\sim$ 10%. Despite this, there is a reasonable agreement between the $b$ and N$_{\rm HI}$ distributions obtained from traditional Voigt profile fitting methods and FLAME's predictions. Our mock HST-COS data analysis, designed to emulate real data parameters, demonstrated that FLAME could achieve consistent accuracy comparable to its performance with simulated data. This finding suggests that the drop in FLAME's accuracy when used on real data primarily arises from the difficulty of replicating the full complexity of real data in the training sample.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Universe from the cosmological horizon to halo scales</title>

Abstract: Ultra-large scales close to the cosmological horizon will be probed by the upcoming observational campaigns. They hold the promise to constrain single-field inflation as well as general relativity, but in order to include them in the forthcoming analyses, their modelling has to be robust. In particular, general relativistic effects may be mistaken for primordial signals, and no consensus has emerged either from analytical modelling nor from the numerical route, obstructed by the large dynamical range to be simulated. In this work, we present a numerical technique to overcome the latter limitation: we compute the general relativistic displacement field with the N-body relativistic code gevolution and combine it with the accurate Newtonian simulation Gadget-4. This combination leads to an effective simulation reproducing the desired behaviour at the level of the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We then measure, for the first time in a simulation, the relativistic scale-dependent bias in Poisson gauge; at redshift $z=0$, we find $b_1^{\mathrm{GR}}=-5.7 \pm 1.7$. Our results at the field level are only valid in the Poisson gauge and need to be complemented with a relativistic ray tracing algorithm to compute the number count observable.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects on the Squeezing of Axion Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is assumed in standard cosmology that the Universe underwent a period of inflation in its earliest phase, providing the seeds for structure formation through vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field. These fluctuations get stretched by the quasi-exponential expansion of the Universe and become squeezed. The aim of this paper is to deepen the understanding of the squeezing process, considering the effect of self-interactions. Axion-like particles can provide a useful setup to study this effect. Specifically we focus on the consequences that a non-trivial evolution of the background axion field has on the squeezing of the perturbations. We follow the evolution of the axion's fluctuation modes from the horizon exit during inflation to the radiation-dominated epoch. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and squeezing parameters, which are linked to the axion particle number and isocurvature perturbation. We find that the quantum mechanical particle production and the squeezing of the perturbations are enhanced, if one accounts for anharmonic effects, i.e., the effect of higher order terms in the potential. This effect becomes particularly strong towards the hilltop of the potential.</description>
