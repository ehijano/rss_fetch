      <title>Superfluidity of quasi-2D He-4 droplets on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superfluid response of nanoscale size quasi-2D He-4 droplets adsorbed on a graphite substrate is investigated by computer simulations. It is found that clusters comprising as few as 7 atoms are stable at temperatures lower than &lt; 0.15 K. Clusters of ~20 atoms or less are liquid-like and ~100% superfluid. As the size is increased, the central region crystallizes, forming the commensurate C_1/3 phase, with a surface sliver of superfluidity evolving into a perimetral 1D Luttinger liquid with increasing cluster size. The relevance to quasi-2D molecular spectroscopy and to transverse quantum superfluidity is discussed.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum chaos without chaos</title>

Abstract: Quantum chaos is a quantum many-body phenomenon that is associated with a number of intricate properties, such as level repulsion in energy spectra or distinct scalings of out-of-time ordered correlation functions. In this work, we introduce a novel class of "pseudochaotic" quantum Hamiltonians that fundamentally challenges the conventional understanding of quantum chaos and its relationship to computational complexity. Our ensemble is computationally indistinguishable from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of strongly-interacting Hamiltonians, widely considered to be a quintessential model for quantum chaos. Surprisingly, despite this effective indistinguishability, our Hamiltonians lack all conventional signatures of chaos: it exhibits Poissonian level statistics, low operator complexity, and weak scrambling properties. This stark contrast between efficient computational indistinguishability and traditional chaos indicators calls into question fundamental assumptions about the nature of quantum chaos. We, furthermore, give an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate Hamiltonians from our ensemble, even though simulating Hamiltonians from the true GUE is known to require exponential time. Our work establishes fundamental limitations on Hamiltonian learning and testing protocols and derives stronger bounds on entanglement and magic state distillation. These results reveal a surprising separation between computational and information-theoretic perspectives on quantum chaos, opening new avenues for research at the intersection of quantum chaos, computational complexity, and quantum information. Above all, it challenges conventional notions of what it fundamentally means to actually observe complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Scale-tailored localization and its observation in non-Hermitian electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect are two paradigmatic wave localization phenomena, resulting from wave interference and the intrinsic non-Hermitian point gap, respectively. In this study, we unveil a novel localization phenomenon associated with long-range asymmetric coupling, termed scale-tailored localization, where the number of induced localized modes and their localization lengths scale exclusively with the coupling range. We show that the long-range coupling fundamentally reshapes the energy spectra and eigenstates by creating multiple connected paths on the lattice. Furthermore, we present experimental observations of scale-tailored localization in non-Hermitian electrical circuits utilizing adjustable voltage followers and switches. The circuit admittance spectra possess separate point-shaped and loop-shaped components in the complex energy plane, corresponding respectively to skin modes and scale-tailored localized states. Our findings not only expand and deepen the understanding of peculiar effects induced by non-Hermiticity but also offer a feasible experimental platform for exploring and controlling wave localizations.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>
