      <title>Graffiti: Enabling an Ecosystem of Personalized and Interoperable Social Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data.
  Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse.
  Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.</description>

      <title>Community-Aware Social Community Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social recommendation, which seeks to leverage social ties among users to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, has emerged as a popular technique for elevating personalized services in recommender systems. Despite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly devised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and largely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique characteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by individuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns in social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to comprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.
  To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model specially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO harnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of them extract community-related global and local structures from the social network via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation, while the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering with observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature redundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and collaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the model optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for communities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong baselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and remarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Modeling roles and trade-offs in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiplex social network captures multiple types of social relations among the same set of people, with each layer representing a distinct type of relationship. Understanding the structure of such systems allows us to identify how social exchanges may be driven by a person's own attributes and actions (independence), the status or resources of others (dependence), and mutual influence between entities (interdependence). Characterizing structure in multiplex networks is challenging, as the distinct layers can reflect different yet complementary roles, with interdependence emerging across multiple scales. Here, we introduce the Multiplex Latent Trade-off Model (MLT), a framework for extracting roles in multiplex social networks that accounts for independence, dependence, and interdependence. MLT defines roles as trade-offs, requiring each node to distribute its source and target roles across layers while simultaneously distributing community memberships within hierarchical, multi-scale structures. Applying the MLT approach to 176 real-world multiplex networks, composed of social, health, and economic layers, from villages in western Honduras, we see core social exchange principles emerging, while also revealing local, layer-specific, and multi-scale communities. Link prediction analyses reveal that modeling interdependence yields the greatest performance gains in the social layer, with subtler effects in health and economic layers. This suggests that social ties are structurally embedded, whereas health and economic ties are primarily shaped by individual status and behavioral engagement. Our findings offer new insights into the structure of human social systems.</description>

      <title>NAEx: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Explaining Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However, our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests. This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2) Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>HCRide: Harmonizing Passenger Fairness and Driver Preference for Human-Centered Ride-Hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience. Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers. Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%, fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graph-aware Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.</description>

      <title>Weak Identification in Peer Effects Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that some phenomena are social: for example, individuals' smoking habits often correlate with those of their peers. Such correlations can have a variety of explanations, such as direct contagion or shared socioeconomic circumstances. The network linear-in-means model is a workhorse statistical model which incorporates these peer effects by including average neighborhood characteristics as regressors. Although the model's parameters are identifiable under mild structural conditions on the network, it remains unclear whether identification ensures reliable estimation in the "infill" asymptotic setting, where a single network grows in size. We show that when covariates are i.i.d. and the average network degree of nodes increases with the population size, standard estimators suffer from bias or slow convergence rates due to asymptotic collinearity induced by network averaging. As an alternative, we demonstrate that linear-in-sums models, which are based on aggregate rather than average neighborhood characteristics, do not exhibit such issues as long as the network degrees have some nontrivial variation, a condition satisfied by most network models.</description>

      <title>Invisible Women in Digital Diplomacy: A Multidimensional Framework for Online Gender Bias Against Women Ambassadors Worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that women in foreign policy often bear the brunt of online hostility, the extent of online gender bias against diplomats remains unexplored. This paper offers the first global analysis of the treatment of women diplomats on social media. Introducing a multidimensional and multilingual methodology for studying online gender bias, it focuses on three critical elements: gendered language, negativity in tweets directed at diplomats, and the visibility of women diplomats. Our unique dataset encompasses ambassadors from 164 countries, their tweets, and the direct responses to these tweets in 65 different languages. Using automated content and sentiment analysis, our findings reveal a crucial gender bias. The language in responses to diplomatic tweets is only mildly gendered and largely pertains to international affairs and, generally, women ambassadors do not receive more negative reactions to their tweets than men, yet the pronounced discrepancy in online visibility stands out as a significant form of gender bias. Women receive a staggering 66.4% fewer retweets than men. By unraveling the invisibility that obscures women diplomats on social media, we hope to spark further research on online bias in international politics.</description>
