      <title>MeltpoolINR: Predicting temperature field, melt pool geometry, and their rate of change in laser powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven, differentiable neural network model designed to learn the temperature field, its gradient, and the cooling rate, while implicitly representing the melt pool boundary as a level set in laser powder bed fusion. The physics-guided model combines fully connected feed-forward neural networks with Fourier feature encoding of the spatial coordinates and laser position. Notably, our differentiable model allows for the computation of temperature derivatives with respect to position, time, and process parameters using autodifferentiation. Moreover, the implicit neural representation of the melt pool boundary as a level set enables the inference of the solidification rate and the rate of change in melt pool geometry relative to process parameters. The model is trained to learn the top view of the temperature field and its spatiotemporal derivatives during a single-track laser powder bed fusion process, as a function of three process parameters, using data from high-fidelity thermo-fluid simulations. The model accuracy is evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model, demonstrating strong generalization ability and close agreement with high-fidelity data.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Local Alloy Fluctuations in InGaN/GaN Multi-Quantum-Disk Light Emitting Diode Heterostructures and Its Impact on the Optical Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneity-governed carrier localization has been investigated in three sets of InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-disk light-emitting diode (LED) structures grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) under different process conditions. A temperature-dependent study of the luminescence peak positions reveals that samples prepared under certain process conditions exhibit a thermal distribution of carriers from the localized states that show the typical S-shaped dependence in luminescence characteristics. The absence of an S-shaped nature in the other sample prepared with relatively higher In-flux infers a superior homogeneity in alloy composition. Further investigation manifested superior optical properties for the samples where the S-shape nature is found to be absent.</description>

      <title>Highly-stable, eco-friendly and selective Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite-based ozone sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as potential gas sensing elements due to their unique ability to detect and respond to an external stimulus with measurable electrical or optical signals. The distinctive characteristics of these materials lie in their ability to operate upon gas exposure at room temperature. However, the presence of lead (Pb) poses a serious challenge for their widespread application and commercialization, owing to its toxicity. To address this issue, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite is explored as a promising alternative sensing element for room temperature gas detection. This sensor can be regarded as eco-friendly for the following reasons: it does not contain Pb; it is synthesized at room temperature without using strong organic solvents; and it operates and recovers at room temperature without heating or UV irradiation and with a very low input voltage (0.1V), thus reducing overall energy consumption. The influence of the perovskite morphology on the ozone (O3) sensing performance is investigated, as well as the sensing stability under varying conditions of time, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the sensors' exceptional selectivity for O3 over other gases and the interaction between the gases and the perovskite surface is confirmed through experimental and first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Near-field acoustic imaging with a caged bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles are ubiquitous in many research applications ranging from ultrasound imaging and drug delivery to the understanding of volcanic eruptions and water circulation in vascular plants. From an acoustic perspective, bubbles are resonant scatterers with remarkable properties, including a large scattering cross-section and strongly sub-wavelength dimensions. While it is known that the resonance properties of bubbles depend on their local environment, it remains challenging to probe this interaction at the single-bubble level due to the difficulty of manipulating a single resonating bubble in a liquid. Here, we confine a cubic bubble inside a cage using 3D printing technology, and we use this bubble as a local probe to perform scanning near-field acoustic microscopy -- an acoustic analogue of scanning near-field optical microscopy. By probing the acoustic interaction between a single resonating bubble and its local environment, we demonstrate near-field imaging of complex structures with a resolution that is two orders of magnitudes smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic field. As a potential application, our approach paves the way for the development of low-cost acoustic microscopes based on caged bubbles.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven Phononic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons are quasi-particles associated with mechanical vibrations in materials, at the root of the propagation of sound, elastic / mechanical waves, and of thermal phenomena, common to our every day life and many technologies. The fundamental understanding and control over phonon responses in natural and artificial media is of major importance in the context of telecommunications, shielding, energy harvesting and control, sensing and imaging, across multiple scales. In this context, it has been recently realized that controlling different classes of symmetries at the microscopic and mesoscopic scale offers a powerful rational tool to precisely tailor phononic responses, leading to advanced acoustic and elastodynamic wave control. In this paper, we review the recent advances in the design and synthesis of artificial phononic media, namely phononic metamaterials, guided by symmetry principles. Starting from tailored broken spatial symmetries, we discuss their interplay with time symmetries for non-reciprocity and non-conservative phenomena, and finally address broader concepts that combine multiple symmetry classes to support exotic phononic wave transport.</description>

      <title>Compositional and Interface Engineering of Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films for Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the fastest-growing photovoltaic (PV) technology in the solar cell community and have reached an efficiency close to that of commercial silicon (Si) solar cells. The organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cell is an emerging PV technology and grabbed much attention due to its low cost, high efficiency, and ease of fabrication at lower temperatures 100-200 C by solution-processed spin coating or thermal evaporation techniques. Further, we introduce a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based hole transport layer (HTL) in the p-i-n device architecture PSC. In this work, we used the mixing engineering strategy of SAM with a conjugated polyelectrolyte. We dealt with the hydrophobicity and tailored the work function of the mixed SAM based HTL. Therefore, the HTL/perovskite interface is engineered, and associated device physics is discussed. In addition, we observed the lowest dark current for specific mixed (9:1) HTL, which is a prerequisite in photodetector applications. Therefore, a detailed photodetection analysis is discussed to study the scalable photodetector device. This thesis thoroughly studies perovskite compositional and interface engineering via various optoelectronic measurements. An in-depth device physics is discussed to study the interfacial defects between the charge transport and the perovskite layers. This thesis will be helpful in exploring a new class of perovskite materials and interface modification engineering for fabricating reproducible, stable, and highly efficient hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Multi-focal Picosecond laser vertical slicing of 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser direct writing inside materials has garnered significant attention for its applications in techniques like two-photon polymerization, stealth dicing and vertical slicing. 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) vertical slicing has wide potentials from research to industry due to low kerf loss and high slicing speed. In this paper, to improve the vertical slicing processing quality and lower the separation strength, we introduce a multi-focal vertical slicing method with spherical aberrations caused by refractive index eliminated. Additionally, by shaping the wavefront of picosecond laser, our experiments show the lower latitudinal ablation zone and higher crack propagation of multi-focal vertical slicing method on 4H-SiC, demonstrating that this method not only reduces filamentations to minimize ablation damage, but also significantly reduce the tensile strength during separation. We achieve a 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot vertical slicing and separation using 4-focal slicing. This method shows various potentials in laser processing.</description>

      <title>Optical characterisation of ilmenite by reflectance spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-directional reflection spectroscopy based on multiple scattering of particulate surfaces is employed in identifying the optical properties of titanium-iron oxide mineral from laboratory reflection measurements.However, the approach suffers from issues including: i) both n and k are to be extracted from a single spectroscopy spectrum, ii) imposing constraints of the K-K correlation relating spectral n and k is weakened by its fundamental insensitivity, and iii) incapability in addressing intrinsic strong absorption features of absorbing materials. We resolve these issues by employing additional optical information of directional-hemispherical reflection and emission/absorption for a slab and a stratified multi-layer medium of the material, respectively. The accompanied analyses consist of radiation transfer in a slab medium investigated using the two-flux approximation method and electromagnetic radiation propagation in a stratified multi-layer medium investigated using the electric filed transfer matrix. We further find that an understanding of the internal scattering coefficient of grains in the multiple scattering model paves the way in successfully predicting absorption features of materials. A wavelength-dependent internal scattering coefficient of the material is then found to be 50 1/micrometer and 1/10000000 1/micrometer in regions of strong absorption and high transmission (between 7 and 13 micrometer), respectively. The value of the refractive index n varies weakly on the wavelength. A pronounced change in the determined absorptive index k with the wavelength is observed. Low values of the absorptive index k on the magnitude of 0.01 are obtained in the transmission window spectral range. In the strong absorption spectral range starting from 13 micrometer, values of the absorptive index k are higher than 0.1.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Crosstalk Silicon Electro-Optic Switch with Cascaded Phase Shifters for Loss Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In silicon electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) switches, crosstalk is typically limited by beam imbalance between the MZI arms, primarily caused by the free carrier absorption loss during routing, thus hindering switch scalability. To address this issue, we propose a low-crosstalk push-pull EO MZI switch by cascading a lightly doped, long phase shifter (PSLL) and a heavily doped, short phase shifter (PSHS) to construct phase-shift arms. In both BAR and CROSS states, PSLL in one arm and PSHS in the other arm are simultaneously forward-biased, with PSLL provides a pi/2 greater phase shift for switching, while PSHS balances loss of PSLL, effectively minimizing crosstalk. Simulations indicate that the proposed switch achieves a crosstalk below -51 dB at a 1310 nm wavelength. The fabricated 2 x 2 silicon EO MZI switch exhibited crosstalk between -33 and -44.2 dB at 1316 nm, and maintained crosstalk below -30 dB across an impressive 61 nm optical bandwidth, with response times under 119 ns. Featuring single-pair electrode control, consistent two-state performance, and a compact size, this approach could enable high-radix switch fabrics in data centers and artificial intelligence compute clusters.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>
