      <title>Physics of mid- and low-mass stars with solar-type activity and their impact on exoplanetary environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the monograph, the authors systematize and generalize the results of studying solar-type activity that is characteristic of a significant part of mid- and low-mass stars of the Galaxy, outline the characteristics of such stars in the quiescent state, during the sporadic flares and variations of magnetic activity over the course of stellar evolution. The observational data taken over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum from decametric radio waves to X-rays are described in detail. The current models of stellar flares and stellar dynamo models are considered in two theoretical chapters. The last part of the book describes the impact of stellar activity of mid- and low-mass stars on exoplanetary environments. The Catalog of Stars with Solar-Type Activity is provided in the supplementary section.
  The book is intended for researchers involved in studying the physics of stars and the Sun, graduate students, and students specialized in heliophysics, astrophysics, and in the field of space physics.
  The cover shows the distribution of 314618 stars with solar-type activity over the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Detection of the lowest mass ratio contact binary in the universe: TYC 3801-1529-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first analysis of the contact binary TYC 3801-1529-1. We observed four sets of multiple bands complete light curves and one set of radial velocity curve of the primary component. Based on a simultaneous investigation of our observed and TESS light curves and the radial velocity curve, we found that TYC 3801-1529-1 is an extremely low-mass-ratio, medium contact binary with $q=0.0356$, with the contribution of the third light at a level of about 10\%. Its mass ratio is lower than V1187 Her, making TYC 3801-1529-1 the lowest mass-ratio contact binary ever found in the universe. The light curves observed in 2022 are asymmetric, which is aptly explained by a hot spot on the primary component. A 16-year eclipse timings analysis indicates a secular increase orbital period with a rate of dp/dt$=7.96(\pm0.35)\times10^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$. We studied the stability of this target and identified that not only the value of $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$, but also the mass ratio surpass the unstable boundary. Hence, TYC 3801-1529-1 presents a challenge to theoretical research and ought to be considered a progenitor of a contact binary merger.</description>

      <title>Investigating the asymmetry of young stellar outflows: Combined MUSE-X-shooter study of the Th 28 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>

      <title>The age of the Methuselah star in light of stellar evolution models with tailored abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. HD140283, or the Methuselah star, is a well-known reference object in stellar evolution. Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence of reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to recent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and spectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these lastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from physical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent spectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for C, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them in grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool to determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an age of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of 14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\pm0.06$Gy). We also find that reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will lead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we find no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from our modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental abundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant differences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a lowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic constraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283, therefore strongly constraining its age.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium inversions of the Si I 10827 A spectral line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the coupling of different atmospheric layers requires observing spectral lines sensitive to the atmospheric parameters, particularly the magnetic field vector, at various heights. The best way to tackle this goal is to perform multi-line observations simultaneously. For instance, the new version of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph instrument offers the possibility to observe the spectral lines at 8542 and 10830 A simultaneously for the first time. The first spectral window contains the Ca II 8542 A spectral line, while the Si I 10827 A transition and He I 10830 A triplet infrared lines can be found in the second spectral window. As the sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters and the height of formation of those transitions is different, combining them can help understand the properties of the solar photosphere and chromosphere and how they are magnetically coupled. Traditionally, the analysis of the Si I 10827 A transition assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which is not the best approximation to model this transition. Hence, in this work, we examine the potential of performing non-LTE (NLTE) inversions of the full Stokes vector of the Si I 10827 A spectral line. The results indicate that we properly infer the atmospheric parameters through an extended range of atmospheric layers in comparison with the LTE case (only valid for the spectral line wings, i.e., the low photosphere), with no impact on the robustness of the solution and just a minor increase in computational time. Thus, the NLTE assumption will help to accurately constrain the photospheric physical parameters when performing combined inversions with, e.g., the Ca II 8542 A spectral line.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing super-Nyquist frequencies via their temporal variation in $\gamma$ Doradus stars from continuous photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mixed with real pulsations, the reflection of super-Nyquist frequencies (SNFs) pose a threat to asteroseismic properties. Although SNFs have been studied in several pulsating stars, a systematic survey remains scarcely explored. Here we propose a method to identify SNFs from Kepler and TESS photometry by characterizing their periodic frequency modulations using a sliding Fourier transform. After analyzing long cadence photometry in the Kepler legacy, we have identified 304 SNFs in 56 stars from 45607 frequencies in $\sim600$ $\gamma$ Doradus stars, corresponding to a fraction of approximately $0.67\%$ and $9.2\%$, respectively. Most SNFs are detected in the frequency range of pressure mode over 120 $\mu$Hz and the fraction of SNF detection increases as frequency up to $\sim7\%$. We barely found two potential SNFs mixed with gravity modes in two $\gamma$ Doradus stars. These findings indicate that SNFs have a negligible impact on the global seismic properties, such as those derived from period spacing in $\gamma$ Doradus stars. However, we stress that SNFs must be carefully and systematically examined by this method in other pulsating stars, particularly $\delta$ Scuti and hot B subdwarf stars, to establish a solid foundation for precise asteroseismolgy of various types of pulsators.</description>

      <title>Models of Mira variables of the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent stellar evolution and nonlinear radial stellar pulsation calculations were carried out for models of asymptotic giant branch stars with initial masses $1.5M_\odot\le M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\le 3M_\odot$ and initial metal abundance $Z=0.006$. All the models are shown to be either the fundamental mode or the first overtone pulsators. The lower limit of the first overtone period increases with increasing mass of the Mira model from $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 80$ days for $M=1.3M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 120$ days for $M=2.6M_\odot$. The upper limit of the first overtone period and lower limit of the fundamental mode period depend on the stellar structure during mode switching and range from $\Pi_{1,\max}=130$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=190$ days for $M=0.96M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\max}=210$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=430$ days for $M=2.2M_\odot$. The slope of the theoretical period--luminosity relation of Mira variables perceptibly increases with decreasing $Z$. Fourier spectra of the kinetic energy of twelve hydrodynamic models show a split of the fundamental mode maximum into several equidistant components. Frequency intervals between split components fall within the range $0.03 \le \Delta\nu/\nu_0 \le 0.1$. The superposition of radial oscillations with the fundamental mode splitting leads to the long-term amplitude variations with the cycle length from 10 to 30 times longer than the fundamental mode period. A more thorough analysis of hydrodynamic models is required for understanding the origin of the principal pulsation mode splitting.</description>

      <title>131 and 304 {\AA} Emission Variability Increases Hours Prior to Solar Flare Onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal changes in coronal loops are well-studied, both in quiescent active regions and in flaring scenarios. However, relatively little attention has been paid to loop emission in the hours before the onset of a solar flare; here, we present the findings of a study of over 50 off-limb flares of GOES class C5.0 and above. We investigated the integrated emission variability for Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly channels 131, 171, 193, and 304 \r{A}ngstroms for 6 hours before each flare, and compared these quantities to the same time range and channels above active regions without proximal flaring. We find significantly increased emission variability in the 2-3 hours before flare onset, particularly for the 131 and 304 channels. This finding suggests a potential new flare prediction methodology. The emission trends between the channels are not consistently well-correlated, suggesting a somewhat chaotic thermal environment within the coronal portion of the loops that disturbs the commonly-observed heating and cooling cycles of quiescent active region loops. We present our approach, the resulting statistics, and discuss the implications for heating sources in these pre-flaring active regions.</description>

      <title>A coronal mass ejection encountered by four spacecraft within 1 au from the Sun: Ensemble modelling of propagation and magnetic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the structure and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere remains one of the most sought-after goals in heliophysics and space weather research. A powerful tool for improving current knowledge and capabilities consists of multi-spacecraft observations of the same event, which take place when two or more spacecraft fortuitously find themselves in the path of a single CME. Multi-probe events can not only supply useful data to evaluate the large-scale of CMEs from 1D in-situ trajectories, but also provide additional constraints and validation opportunities for CME propagation models. In this work, we analyse and simulate the coronal and heliospheric evolution of a slow, streamer-blowout CME that erupted on 23 September 2021 and was encountered in situ by four spacecraft approximately equally distributed in heliocentric distance between 0.4 and 1 au. We employ the Open Solar Physics Rapid Ensemble Information (OSPREI) modelling suite in ensemble mode to predict the CME arrival and structure in a hindcast fashion and to compute the "best-fit" solutions at the different spacecraft individually and together. We find that the spread in the predicted quantities increases with heliocentric distance, suggesting that there may be a maximum (angular and radial) separation between an inner and an outer probe beyond which estimates of the in-situ magnetic field orientation (parameterised by flux rope model geometry) increasingly diverge. We discuss the importance of these exceptional observations and the results of our investigation in the context of advancing our understanding of CME structure and evolution as well as improving space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Starspots as an Explanation for the Mysterious IYJ Continuum Excess Emission in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate estimation of the continuum excess emission from accretion spots and inner circumstellar disk regions is crucial for a proper derivation of fundamental stellar parameters in accreting systems. However, the presence of starspots can make disentangling the complicated multi-component emission in these systems challenging. Subtraction of a single-temperature spectral template is insufficient to account for the composite stellar emission, as we demonstrated in a recent campaign involving Weak-Lined T Tauri Stars. Here, we model the moderate resolution near-infrared spectra of Classical T Tauri Stars, presenting new spectral models that incorporate spotted stars plus emission from accretion hot-spots and a warm inner disk, allowing us to simultaneously reconstruct the entire 0.8-2.4 micrometer spectrum of our sixteen targets. Using these models, we re-derive the continuum excess emission. Our results indicate that accounting for starspots resolves the need to include a previously proposed intermediate temperature component in the IYJ excess, and highlights the importance of a proper treatment of starspots in studies of accreting low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Analyses of Multiple Balmer Emission Lines from Accreting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planetary growth rate, a.k.a., the mass accretion rate, is a fundamental parameter in planet formation, as it determines a planet's final mass. Planetary mass accretion rates have been estimated using hydrogen lines, based on the models originally developed for accreting stars, known as the accretion flow model. Recently, Aoyama et al. (2018) introduced the accretion shock model as an alternative mechanism for hydrogen line emission. However, it remains unclear which model is more appropriate for accreting planets and substellar objects. To address this, we applied both models to archival data consisting of 96 data points from 76 accreting brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars, with masses ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.1 $M_\sun$, to test which model best explains their accreting properties. The results showed that the emission mechanisms of 15 data points are best explained by the shock model, while 55 data points are best explained by the flow model. For the 15 data points explained by the planetary shock model, the shock model estimates up to several times higher mass accretion rates than the flow model. As this trend is more pronounced for planetary mass objects, it is crucial to determine which emission mechanism is dominant in individual planets. We also discuss the physical parameters that determine the emission mechanisms and the variability of line ratios.</description>

      <title>Investigation into Pulsar Glitch Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An updated analysis of pulsar glitch parameters was conducted using a sample of 215 pulsars, encompassing 677 recorded glitch events, each glitch at least once between 1968 and 2024. The glitch rates were estimated and plotted against various pulsar parameters, including rotational frequency, spin-down rate, and characteristic age. These relationships were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results indicate linear and weak relationships between glitch rate and the pulsar parameters. However, the relationship between glitch rate and characteristic age is inversely weak.</description>

Abstract: Observational studies are identifying stars thought to be remnants from the earliest stages of the hierarchical mass assembly of the Milky Way, referred to as the proto-Galaxy. We use red giant stars with kinematics and [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H] estimates from Gaia DR3 data to investigate the relationship between azimuthal velocity and metallicity, aiming to understand the transition from a chaotic proto-Galaxy to a well-ordered, rotating (old) disc-like population. To analyse the structure of the data in [M/H]-v$_\phi$ space for both high- and low-$\alpha$ samples with carefully defined $\alpha$-separation, we develop a model with two Gaussian components in v$_\phi$: one representing a disc-like population and the other a halo-like population. This model is designed to capture the conditional distribution P(v$_\phi$ $\mid$ [M/H]) with a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model with fixed azimuthal velocities means and standard deviations. To quantify the spin-up of the high-$\alpha$ disc population, we extend this two-component model by allowing the mean velocity and velocity dispersion to vary between the spline knots across the metallicity range used. We also compare our findings with existing literature using traditional Gaussian Mixture Modelling in bins of [M/H] and investigate using orbital circularity instead of azimuthal velocity. Our findings show that the metal-poor high-$\alpha$ disc gradually spins up across [M/H] $\sim$ -1.7 to -1.0, while the low-$\alpha$ sample exhibits a sharp transition at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0. This latter result is due to the accreted debris dominating the metal-poor end, underscoring the critical role of [$\alpha$/M] selection in studying the (old) disc evolution of the Milky Way. These results indicate that the proto-Galaxy underwent a slow, monotonic spin-up phase rather than a rapid, dramatic spin-up at [M/H] $\sim$ -1.0, as previously inferred.</description>

      <title>Developing a Non-Newtonian Fluid Model for Dust, for Application to Astrophysical Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the astrophysics community it is common practice to model collisionless dust, entrained in a gas flow, as a pressureless fluid. However a pressureless fluid is fundamentally different from a collisionless fluid - the latter of which generically possess a non-zero anisotropic pressure or stress tensor. In this paper we derive a fluid model for collisionless dust, entrained in a turbulent gas, starting from the equations describing the motion of individual dust grains. We adopt a covariant formulation of our model to allow for the geometry and coordinate systems prevalent in astrophysics, and provide a closure valid for the accretion disc context. We show that the continuum mechanics properties of a dust fluid corresponds to a higher-dimensional anisotropic Maxwell fluid, after the extra dimensions are averaged out, with a dynamically important rheological stress tensor. This higher-dimensional treatment has the advantage of keeping the dust velocity and velocity of the fluid seen, and their respective moments, on the same footing. This results in a simplification of the constitutive relation describing the evolution of the dust Rheological stress.</description>

      <title>New insight into the orbital parameters of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda &gt; 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $&gt; 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous planet masses I: Reanalysis of archival HARPS radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical exoplanet mass-radius relations have been used to study the demographics and compositions of small exoplanets for many years. However, the heterogeneous nature of these measurements hinders robust statistical analysis of this population, particularly with regard to the masses of planets. For this reason, we perform a homogeneous and consistent re-analysis of the radial velocity (RV) observations of 85 small exoplanets using publicly available HARPS RV data and the fitting toolkit Pyaneti. For the entire sample, we run 12 different models to investigate the impact of modelling choices, including the use of multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes (GPs) to mitigate stellar activity. We find that the way orbital eccentricity is modelled can significantly impact the RV amplitude found in some cases. We also find that the addition of a GP to mitigate stellar activity does impact the RV amplitude found - though if the GP is modelled on activity indicators as well as the RVs the results are more robust. The RV amplitude found for every planet in our sample using all the models is made available for other groups to perform demographics studies. Finally, we provide a list of recommendations for the RV community moving forward.</description>

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) taken from Romagnolo et al. (2024, Paper I); by running evolution models for initial masses 60 and 200 Msun, using MESA and GENEC. For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. Both codes predict different tracks across the HRD. For the 60 Msun case, Genec models predict a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas MESA model predicts a large radial expansion post-MS reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 Msun case, differences are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing, and only the treatment for superadiabacity creates an impact during the He-burning stage. The switch of the mass loss based on the proximity to the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface formed from initial masses $\gtrsim60$ Msun. These stars are constrained in a Teff range of the HR diagram which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_e$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades introduced in Paper I, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>The companion mass distribution of post common envelope hot subdwarf binaries: evidence for boosted and disrupted magnetic braking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the mass distribution of main-sequence (MS) companions to hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) in post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs). We carried out a spectroscopic survey of 14 eclipsing systems ("HW Vir binaries") with orbital periods of $3.8 &lt; P_{\rm orb} &lt; 12$ hours, resulting in a well-understood selection function and a near-complete sample of HW Vir binaries with $G &lt; 16$. We constrain companion masses from the radial velocity curves of the sdB stars. The companion mass distribution peaks at $M_{\rm MS}\approx 0.15 M_{\odot}$ and drops off at $M_{\rm MS} &gt; 0.2\,M_{\odot}$, with only two systems hosting companions above the fully-convective limit. There is no correlation between $P_{\rm orb}$ and $M_{\rm MS}$ within the sample. A similar drop-off in the companion mass distribution of white dwarf (WD) + MS PCEBs has been attributed to disrupted magnetic braking (MB) below the fully-convective limit. We compare the sdB companion mass distribution to predictions of binary evolution simulations with a range of MB laws. Because sdBs have short lifetimes compared to WDs, explaining the lack of higher-mass MS companions to sdBs with disrupted MB requires MB to be boosted by a factor of 20-100 relative to MB laws inferred from the rotation evolution of single stars. We speculate that such boosting may be a result of irradiation-driven enhancement of the MS stars' winds. An alternative possibility is that common envelope evolution favors low-mass companions in short-period orbits, but the existence of massive WD companions to sdBs with similar periods disfavors this scenario.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Hot Spots at Solar Coronal Loop Footpoints Revealed by Hyperspectral Imaging Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Unstable gas flow in a flat channel under the influence of a transverse force field: self-oscillations of the jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subsonic flow of an ideal gas through a flat channel in the presence of a mass force field is considered. The forces acting on the gas are reduced to the attraction to the channel axis in a certain region of the channel. It has been shown that the occurrence of a zone of increased pressure along the axis of a channel leads to the formation of a pressure gradient, which acts as an effective force which opposes the flow. As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric. The characteristics of this instability have been studied numerically in the present work. Possible astrophysical implications of this phenomenon are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter era: Short-exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite on board Solar Orbiter while operating in short-exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward-modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short-exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short-exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons that spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Realistic binary neutron star initial data with Elliptica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01701</link>

Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide quark-matter equations of state (EoS) that can be used for hadron-quark hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on the parameters of the quark-matter model. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, the speed of sound, the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kilometers in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the speed of sound squared reaches up to $c_s^2 \sim 0.6$ and the CFL gap up to $\Delta\sim250\,$MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction does not increase the maximum mass substantially. Thus we use the $2.0 M_{\odot}$ constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid-star model, demonstrating that there is room for different color-superconducting compositions. The hybrid EoSs obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 $M_\odot$. We find that these EoSs are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low to intermediate densities ($\sim 1-3\, n_{\text{sat}}$).</description>
