      <title>Photonic Circuit of Arbitrary Non-Unitary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A design framework to implement non-unitary input-output operations to a practical unitary photonic integrated circuit is described. This is achieved by utilising the cosine-sine decomposition to recover the unitarity of the original operation. The recovered unitary operation is decomposed into fundamental unitary building blocks, forming a photonic integrated circuit network based on directional couplers and waveguide phase shifters. The individual building blocks are designed and optimised by three-dimensional full-wave simulations and scaled up using a circuit approach. The paper investigates the scalability and robustness of the design approach. Our study demonstrates that the proposed approach of performing unitary matrix completion can be applied to any arbitrary matrices. This design approach allows for implementation of non-unitary operations to perform various linear functions in neuromorphic photonics for computing, sensing, signal processing and communications.</description>

      <title>Dual Quadrature Phasemeter for Space-Based Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a dual quadrature phasemeter, an implementation of a phase-locked loop designed to track the phase of homodyne and heterodyne inter-satellite laser links. The dual quadrature phasemeters use dual quadrature optical detection to enable an alternate phase readout scheme that operates with wider bandwidths and on signals with carrier frequency differences down to DC. Analytical modeling demonstrates that dual quadrature phasemeters overcome the bandwidth limitations of conventional phasemeters. Numerical simulations of noise linearity tests found that the phase tracking error of the dual quadrature phasemeter is less than 10 microcycle/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in the presence of non-linear cyclic errors. The dual quadrature phasemeter enables exploration of a new optical configuration for retroreflector-based space geodesy missions with architecture similar to that implemented in GRACE-FO. One such alternate configuration is proposed that is capable of tracking satellite separation without requiring a frequency offset between local and incoming light, eliminating the need for optical frequency shifters.</description>

      <title>Photonic systolic array for all-optical matrix-matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systolic arrays have proven to be highly efficient for parallelized matrix-matrix multiplication (MMM), utilizing synchronized, heartbeat-like data flows across an array of processing elements. While optical structures such as waveguide crossbar arrays and Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based meshes serve as photonic equivalents to the systolic arrays, the disparity between the two input matrices for multiplication -- one using optical signals and the other with system-defined parameters -- gives rise to a bottleneck in modern machine-learning tasks, such as evaluating attention scores in large language models. Here, we propose a photonic systolic array that performs MMM entirely with optical signals, utilizing homodyne detection at each array cell. Adjoint-based design of compact on-chip freeform optical modules enables precise control of light flow without bulky waveguide coupling schemes. The operation of a $4\times4$ photonic systolic array is numerically verified, achieving a theoretical computation density of $6.2~\mathrm{PMACs}/\mathrm{mm}^2/\mathrm{s}$. This design marks a significant step toward practical photonic computing hardware for modern AI workloads.</description>

      <title>Broadband Optoelectronic Mixer for Terahertz Frequency-Comb Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate ultra-broadband optoelectronic mixing of frequency combs that provides phase-coherent detection of a repetition frequency up to 500 GHz, using a high-speed modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) photodiode. Nonlinear photo-electron effects in the photodiode itself enable harmonic generation and down-mixing process of combs with widely different repetition frequency. Specifically, we generate two, 25 GHz frequency combs and use an optical filter to explore coherent down-mixing to baseband of comb spectral components across microwave, millimeter wave, and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The exceptional noise performance of the optoelectronic mixer enables the phase-coherent measurement of millimeter-wave and THz frequency combs with an Allan deviation of 10^-13/t for a measurement time of t. We further investigate the dependence of conversion loss on the reverse bias voltage and photocurrent. The experimental results indicate that we can minimize the conversion loss by operating the photodiode at an optimal voltage and maximum available photocurrent. Our work provides a solution for millimeter-wave and THz frequency comb measurements and facilitates fully stabilized frequency combs with microresonators.</description>

      <title>First-in-human spinal cord tumor imaging with fast adaptive focus tracking robotic-OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21809v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current surgical procedures for spinal cord tumors lack in vivo high-resolution, high-speed multifunctional imaging systems, posing challenges for precise tumor resection and intraoperative decision-making. This study introduces the Fast Adaptive Focus Tracking Robotic Optical Coherence Tomography (FACT-ROCT) system,designed to overcome these obstacles by providing real-time, artifact-free multifunctional imaging of spinal cord tumors during surgery. By integrating cross-scanning, adaptive focus tracking and robotics, the system addresses motion artifacts and resolution degradation from tissue movement, achieving wide-area, high-resolution imaging. We conducted intraoperative imaging on 21 patients, including 13 with spinal gliomas and 8 with other tumors. This study marks the first demonstration of OCT in situ imaging of human spinal cord tumors, providing micrometer-scale in vivo structural images and demonstrating FACT-ROCT's potential to differentiate various tumor types in real-time. Analysis of the attenuation coefficients of spinal gliomas revealed increased heterogeneity with higher malignancy grades. So, we proposed the standard deviation of the attenuation coefficient as a physical marker, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas intraoperatively at a threshold. FACT-ROCT even enabled extensive in vivo microvascular imaging of spinal cord tumors, covering 70 mm * 13 mm * 10 mm within 2 minutes. Quantitative vascular tortuosity comparisons confirmed greater tortuosity in higher-grade tumors. The ability to perform extensive vascular imaging and real-time tumor grading during surgery provides critical information for surgical strategy, such as minimizing intraoperative bleeding and optimizing tumor resection while preserving functional tissue.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Non-Hermitian Skin Effects in Coupled Hermitian Chains with Cross-Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the presence of an anomalous non-Hermitian skin effects which decay from both ends of a system consisting of two coupled Hermitian chains induced by non-reciprocal inter-chain cross-coupling. Another intriguing feature of the system is that its eigenenergy spectrum in thermodynamic limit deviates from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), contrary to that of conventional non-Hermitian systems. The thermodynamic-limit energy spectrum is however restored to the GBZ by the presence of even an infinitesimal amount of gain and/or loss term to the system. In this case, the system exhibits a critical phenomena similar to that of coupled non-Hermitian chains, whereby the eigenspectrum starts to approach the GBZ beyond some critical size. Furthermore, the non Hermitian skin effect becomes less pronounced as the system size exceeds this critical size. We analytically explain these peculiar features which highlight the important role of gain and loss terms as well as inter-chain coupling in tuning non-Hermitian skin modes, thus suggesting a new avenue for the modulation of the skin mode characteristics of open systems.</description>

      <title>Method of measuring the chromatic dispersion parameter of optical fibers using a single-arm interferometer and a fiber femtosecond frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a method for measuring the chromatic dispersion parameter (D) of optical fibers and bulk optical elements through the use of a single-arm three-wave interferometer and a fiber femtosecond frequency comb (FFFC). The FFFC is frequency locked to a single-ytterbium-ion optical standard and employed as a source of highly stable and broadband laser radiation. The FFFC spectrum ranges from 1 to 2 microns, which is the most demanded range in fiber optics. The theoretical model presented in the work is used to derive analytical expressions for the parameter D, taking into account the second-order group velocity dispersion. To validate the methodology, the parameter D is measured for a standard single-mode SMF-28 fiber. The proposed method enables the precise measurement of the parameter D with high accuracy across a broad spectral range in a relatively short time.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size-Dependent Surface Plasmonic Resonances of Liquid Metal Alloy (EGaIn) Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. EGaIn, known for its unique properties such as low toxicity, negligible vapor pressure, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, is appealing in broad wavelength plasmonic applications. In particular, this study reveals uncovered LSPR effects in the visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR peaks and cross-sections for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. The findings offer insights into correlating EGaIn nanoparticle geometry with their optical properties for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>High-precision programming of large-scale ring resonator circuits with minimal pre-calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microring resonators (MRRs) are essential components in large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs), but programming these circuits with high precision and efficiency remains an unsolved challenge. Conventional methods rely on complex calibration processes that are both time-consuming and often inaccurate, limiting the scalability of PICs. This work introduces an innovative control method called chip-in-the-loop optimization (ChiL) that addresses this challenge by offering high scalability, precision, fast convergence, and robustness. ChiL reduces the calibration complexity for an $N$ devices system from $O(k^N)$ to a single-shot measurement, while maintaining a record-high precision over 9-bit in the presence of system imperfections, including fabrication variances, thermal crosstalk, and temperature drift. Using ChiL, we experimentally demonstrate a photonic solver for computing matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors with errors on the order of $10^{-4}$. Additionally, we achieve a photonic neural network (PNN) with accuracy and a confusion matrix identical to those of digital computers. ChiL offers a practical approach for programming large-scale PICs and bridges the gap between analog photonic and digital electronic computing and signal processing in both scale and precision.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Solid-State Single-Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters (SPEs) are attracting significant attention as fundamental components in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Low-dimensional materials-based SPEs (LD-SPEs) have drawn particular interest due to their high photon extraction efficiency, ease of integration with photonic circuits, and strong coupling with external fields. The accessible surfaces of LD materials allow for deterministic control over quantum light emission, while enhanced quantum confinement and light-matter interactions improve photon emissive properties. This review examines recent progress in LDSPEs across four key materials: zero-dimensional (0D) semiconductor quantum dots, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes, two-dimensional (2D) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We explore their structural and photophysical properties, along with techniques such as spectral tuning and cavity coupling that enhance SPE performance. Finally, we address future challenges and suggest strategies for optimizing LD-SPEs for practical quantum applications.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Information Storage in An Intelligent Response Phosphor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent phosphor has emerged as a promising candidate for information storage due to the rapid accessibility and low-energy requirements. However, the low storage capacity has limited its practical application. Herein, we skillfully designed and developed NaGdGeO4:Pb2+,Tb3+ stimulated phosphor by trace doped Sm3+. As expected, this phosphor demonstrates the larger carrier capacity than traditional commercial SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ phosphors and super-strong thermo-stimulated luminescence (TSL) that is three times greater than its photoluminescence (PL) intensity (PL efficiency: 17.3%). A mechanism of the enhanced and controllable TSL is proposed based on electron-hole defect pair structure. We further present a high-throughput optical data recording in five dimensions in a single fluorescent film recording layer. The findings described here provides not only a universal approach for construction TSL materials, but also a new paradigm for future generation optical storage technology.</description>

      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. This work presents the design of a differential pumping system, enabling, for the first time, continuous operation of our kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system successfully maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in disordered two-dimensional electronic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I formulate a theory of the inverse Faraday effect in impure two-dimensional metallic system with lifted spin degeneracy induced by Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using the formalism of non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the static contributions to the current density up to the second order in powers of external electromagnetic field are evaluated. For circularly polarized light one of the contributions describes the emergence of static magnetization. It is shown that the direction of induced magnetization may change depending on the frequency of the external radiation and disorder scattering rate. I also find that at large frequencies the leading contribution to the induced magnetization is proportional to the square of spin-orbit interaction and is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the frequency of an external electromagnetic wave.</description>

      <title>Near-field dynamical Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclasscical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical light sources.</description>

      <title>Laboratory characterisation bench for high precision astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision differential astrometry assesses the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects in relation to the stars. The focal plane of such space telescope must be calibrated with a precision down to the level of 1e-5 pixel in order to be able to detect Earth-like planets in the close vicinity of the Sun. The presented characterization bench is designed to improve the technology readiness level for the following key points: calibration of new detectors with a high number of pixels and correcting the field distortion using stars in the field of view. The first aim of the project concentrates on the characterization of a 46 megapixels sensor from PYXALIS, to assess its typical parameters using an integrating sphere. The next objective intends to map the intra and extra pixel quantum yield of the detector with a precision of 1e-5 pixels and investigate the evolution of the pixel geometry in response to environment fluctuations. To conduct these tests, an optical bench is designed with an LCD screen and a doublet, used as a source that allows directing light to specific groups of pixels. Interferometric calibration of the detector pixel centroid position will be achieved using fibers that illuminate the detector with Young's fringes. To characterize the distortion of the detector, a diaphragm will produce adjustable optical aberrations to be corrected and therefore change the source sensor positional relationship. The final step involves the simulation of a star's field, which will be imaged on the detector to assess optical quality.</description>

      <title>Multi-partite entanglement in extreme nanophotonic cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-partite entanglement is fundamental to emerging quantum technologies such as quantum networks, which ultimately require devices with strong light-matter interactions and long coherence times. Here, we introduce nanobeam photonic crystal cavities combining both extreme quality factors ($\sim10^{7}$) with sub-wavelength field confinement to reach unprecedented light-matter interactions. Operating at $780$ nm, our devices are tailored for efficient coupling and entanglement with ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms, a key ingredient in quantum networks due to their hyperfine structure. Our new designs also facilitate the precise optical trapping of atoms, and we demonstrate coherent entanglement generation between them, that is remarkably resilient to atomic displacements. These platforms can be easily scaled-up to extremely large quantum networks, for distributed quantum computing and future light-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband thin-film lithium tantalate modulator for high-speed communications</title>

Abstract: The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.</description>

      <title>A simple accurate way to model noise-seeded ultrafast nonlinear processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise can play an important role in nonlinear pulse propagation. It is not only the origin of fluctuations in supercontinuum but can also determine the generated signal amplitude and phase, as seen in phenomena such as noise-seeded four-wave mixing and spontaneous Raman scattering. Current models rely on input-pulse shot noise and Raman Langevin term to simulate noise-seeded Kerr effects and spontaneous Raman scattering, respectively. However, they cannot accurately simulate any nonlinear effects exhibiting asymmetries, for example, between spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes generation, or in amplification with emission and absorption cross sections. Moreover, combining these two techniques does not lead to accurate modeling of both effects simultaneously, especially in unsaturated Raman operational regimes or supercontinuum where spontaneous Raman emission noise plays a crucial role. To resolve this issue, we propose a new modified shot-noise model by directly introducing noise into the pulse propagation equation. It minimally modifies current models that contain only stimulated terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Locking of Intrinsic Spin Squeezed State in Earth-field-range Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Earth-field range, the nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effect has been a bottleneck limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of atomic magnetometry from physical mechanism. To break this bottleneck, various techniques are introduced to suppress the NLZ effect. Here we revisit the spin dynamics in the Earth-field-range magnetometry and identify the existence of the intrinsic spin squeezed state (SSS) generated from the geomagnetically induced NLZ effect with the oscillating squeezing degree and squeezing axis. Such oscillating features of the SSS prevent its direct observation and as well, accessibility to magnetic sensing. To exploit quantum advantage of the intrinsic SSS in the Earth-field-range magnetometry, it's essential to lock the oscillating SSS to a persistent one. Hence, we develop a quantum locking technique to achieve a persistent SSS, benefiting from which the sensitivity of the Earth-field-range magnetometer is quantum-enhanced. This work presents an innovative way turning the drawback of NLZ effect into the quantum advantage and opens a new access to quantum-enhanced magnetometry in the Earth-field range.</description>

      <title>Optical manifestations of topological Euler class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional heterodyne readout schemes are now under reconsideration due to the realization of techniques to evade its inherent 3 dB signal-to-noise penalty. The application of high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed states can further improve the readout sensitivity of audio-band signals. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced heterodyne readout of two spatially distinct interferometers with direct optical signal combination, circumventing the 3 dB heterodyne signal-to-noise penalty. Applying a high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed state, we show further signal-to-noise improvement of an injected audio band signal of 3.5 dB. This technique is applicable for quantum-limited high-precision experiments, with application to searches for quantum gravity, gravitational wave detection and wavelength-multiplexed quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantized Integrated Shift Effect in Multigap Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional multigap topological insulators can host quantized integrated shift photoconductivities due to bulk invariants that are defined under reality conditions imposed by additional symmetries. We recast the quantization in terms of the integrated torsion tensor and the non-Abelian Berry connection constituting Chern-Simons forms. Physically, we recognize that the topological quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the optical response. Our findings provide another quantized electromagnetic dc response due to the nontrivial band topology, beyond the quantum anomalous Hall effect of Chern insulators and quantized circular photogalvanic effect found in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Tunable generation of spatial entanglement in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>
