      <title>Annual net community production and carbon exports in the central Sargasso Sea from autonomous underwater glider observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of ship-based observations at the Bermuda Atlantic Timeseries Study (BATS) site, ambiguities linger in our understanding of the region's annual carbon cycle. Difficulties reconciling geochemical estimates of annual net community production (ANCP) with direct measurements of nutrient delivery and carbon exports (EP) have implied either an insufficient understanding of these processes, and/or that they are playing out on shorter time and spatial scales than resolved by monthly sampling. We address the latter concern using autonomous underwater gliders equipped with biogeochemical sensors to quantify ANCP from mass balances of oxygen (O2) and nitrate (NO3) over a full annual cycle. The timing, amplitude and distribution of O2 production, consumption, and NO3 fluxes reaffirm ideas about strong seasonality in physical forcing and trophic structure creating a dual system: i.e. production fueled by NO3 supplied to the photic zone from deeper layers in the first half of the year, versus being recycled within the upper ocean during the second half. The evidence also supports recently proposed hypotheses regarding the production and recycling of carbon with non-Redfield characteristics, deplete in nitrogen and phosphorus, to explain observed patterns of high NCP in the absence of significant NO3 supply. It further identifies significant contributions to ANCP and EP potentially linked to vertically migrating communities of salps in spring after all convective activity has ceased. The improved resolution of the datasets, combined with more precise definitions of photic and subphotic integration depths, brings the estimates of ANCP and EP into better alignment with each other.</description>

      <title>Assessing Climate Vulnerability Risk for Substations in Massachusetts Via Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric grid is increasingly vital, supporting essential services such as healthcare, heating and cooling transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. This growing dependence on reliable power underscores the need for enhanced grid resilience. This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Reduced-Order Surrogate Models Applied to Cloud Microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</description>

      <title>Nowcast3D: Reliable precipitation nowcasting via gray-box learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\% of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.</description>

      <title>OceanAI: A Conversational Platform for Accurate, Transparent, Near-Real-Time Oceanographic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans. A public demonstration is available at https://oceanai.ai4ocean.xyz.</description>
