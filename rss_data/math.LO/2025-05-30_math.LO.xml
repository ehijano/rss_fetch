      <title>Relative to any non-arithmetic set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable structure $\mathcal{A}$, the degree spectrum of $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all Turing degrees which can compute an isomorphic copy of $\mathcal{A}$. One of the major programs in computable structure theory is to determine which (upwards closed, Borel) classes of degrees form a degree spectrum. We resolve one of the major open problems in this area by showing that the non-arithmetic degrees are a degree spectrum. Our main new tool is a new form of unfriendly jump inversions where the back-and-forth types are maximally complicated. This new tool has several other applications.</description>

      <title>A canonical Makanin-Razborov diagram and a pseudo topology for sets of tuples in free groups, semigroups, associative algebras and Lie algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JSJ decomposition and the Makanin-Razborov diagram were proved to be essential in studying varieties over free groups, semigroups and associative algebras. In this paper we suggest a unified conceptual approach to the applicability of these structures over all these algebraic categories. With a variety over each of these algebraic categories we naturally associate a set of tuples in a free group. Then we show how to associate a Makanin-Razborov diagram with any set of tuples over a free group. Furthermore, in case the MR diagram that is associated with a set of tuples is single ended, we prove that there is a canonical Makanin-Razborov diagram that can be associated with such a set. This canonical diagram is a main key in studying varieties over free semigroups, associative algebras and Lie algebras, and encodes the global structure of these varieties. It enables us to define a (pseudo) closure of a set of tuples over each of the algebraic objects, associate a rank with it (analogous to Shelah and Lascar ranks), and over free groups the closure provides a canonical envelope that is essential in studying the structure and the properties of definable sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two subclasses of the class of automatic structures: automatic structures of polynomial growth and Presburger structures. We present algebraic characterisations of the groups and the equivalence structures in these two classes.</description>

      <title>Agent Interpolation for Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new type of proof formalism for multi-agent modal logics with S5-type modalities. This novel formalism combines the features of hypersequents to represent S5 modalities with nested sequents to represent the T-like modality alternations. We show that the calculus is sound and complete, cut-free, and terminating and yields decidability and the finite model property for multi-agent S5. We also use it to prove the Lyndon (and hence Craig) interpolation property for multi-agent S5, considering not only propositional atoms but also agents to be part of the common language. Finally, we discuss the difficulties on the way to extending these results to the logic of distributed knowledge and to deductive interpolation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Algebra: Algebraic Semantics for Continuous Propositional Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have introduced continuous algebra as the algebraic semantics for Continuous Propositional Logic (CPL). A Continuous algebra is an MV-algebra together with an unary operator $\kappa$, analogous to the unary connective $\dfrac{1}{2}$ in CPL. We establish structural results, including the subdirect representation theorem. We also introduce $\ell u^*$-groups, which are lattice ordered groups with strong unit $u$, denoted by $\ell u$-groups, with a partial operator $^*$ that mimics the behavior of $\kappa$ over the interval $[id,u]$. This addition enables a natural correspondence between $\ell u^*$-groups and the continuous algebras, allowing us to prove the Chang's completeness theorem for the continuous algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate big Ramsey degrees of finite substructures of the universal countable homogeneous meet-tree and its binary variant. We prove that structures containing antichains have infinite big Ramsey degrees, and the big Ramsey degree of a 2-element chain is at least 8 and 7 for the binary variant. We deduce that the generic C-relation does not have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>
