      <title>Long-term Health and Human Capital Effects of Early-Life Economic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term health and human capital impacts of local economic conditions experienced during the first 1,000 days of life. We combine historical data on monthly unemployment rates in urban England and Wales 1952-1967 with data from the UK Biobank on later-life outcomes. Leveraging variation in unemployment driven by national industry-specific shocks weighted by industry's importance in each area, we find no evidence that small, common fluctuations in local economic conditions during the early life period affect health or human capital in older age.</description>

      <title>Do Temporary Workers Face Higher Wage Markdowns? Evidence from India's Automotive Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are temporary workers subject to different wage markdowns than permanent workers? This paper examines productivity, output markups, and wage markdowns in India's automotive sector during 2000--2020. I develop a model integrating CES production, nested logit labor supply, and differentiated labor market conduct: Nash-Bertrand wage setting for temporary workers versus Nash bargaining for unionized permanent workers. Results reveal declining output markups as marginal costs outpace prices through productivity deceleration. Rising labor-augmenting productivity cannot offset declining Hicks-neutral productivity, reducing overall TFP. Labor market power substantially compresses worker compensation: wage markdowns persist at 40% for temporary workers and 10% for permanent workers.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI Capabilities and Evolving Labor Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the labor market consequences of AI by analyzing near real-time changes in employment status and work hours across occupations in relation to advances in AI capabilities. We construct a dynamic Occupational AI Exposure Score based on a task-level assessment using state-of-the-art AI models, including ChatGPT 4o and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We introduce a five-stage framework that evaluates how AI's capability to perform tasks in occupations changes as technology advances from traditional machine learning to agentic AI. The Occupational AI Exposure Scores are then linked to the US Current Population Survey, allowing for near real-time analysis of employment, unemployment, work hours, and full-time status. We conduct a first-differenced analysis comparing the period from October 2022 to March 2023 with the period from October 2024 to March 2025. Higher exposure to AI is associated with reduced employment, higher unemployment rates, and shorter work hours. We also observe some evidence of increased secondary job holding and a decrease in full-time employment among certain demographics. These associations are more pronounced among older and younger workers, men, and college-educated individuals. College-educated workers tend to experience smaller declines in employment but are more likely to see changes in work intensity and job structure. In addition, occupations that rely heavily on complex reasoning and problem-solving tend to experience larger declines in full-time work and overall employment in association with rising AI exposure. In contrast, those involving manual physical tasks appear less affected. Overall, the results suggest that AI-driven shifts in labor are occurring along both the extensive margin (unemployment) and the intensive margin (work hours), with varying effects across occupational task content and demographics.</description>

      <title>From Revolution to Ruin: An Empirical Analysis Yemen's State Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the broad repercussions of Yemen's 2011 revolution and subsequent civil war on its macroeconomic trajectories, human development, and quality of governance by constructing counterfactual benchmarks using a balanced panel of 37 developing countries over 1990-2022. Drawing on matrix-completion estimators with alternative shrinkage regimes and a LASSO-augmented synthetic-control method, we generate Yemen's hypothetical no-conflict paths for key macroeconomic aggregates, demographic and health indicators, and governance metrics. Across the full spectrum of methods, the conflict's outbreak corresponds with a dramatic reversal of economic and institutional development. We find that output and income experience an unprecedented contraction, investment and trade openness deteriorate sharply, and gains in life expectancy and human development are broadly reversed. Simultaneously, measures of political accountability, administrative capacity, rule of law, and corruption control collapse, reflecting systemic institutional breakdown. The concordance of results across a variety of empirical strategies attests to the robustness of our estimates.</description>

      <title>Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts. Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context) with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences between LLM and human evaluations (p &lt; 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts strongly to company context (p &lt; 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for Firm1), and Claude minimally (p &gt; 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their deployment in automated hiring systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing the analysis of resilience of global phosphate flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating material flows, with a focus on tracing phosphate flows from mining countries to those using phosphate in agricultural production. Our approach integrates data on phosphate rock extraction, fertilizer use, and international trade of phosphate-related products. A key advantage of this method is that it does not require detailed data on material concentrations, as these are indirectly estimated within the model. We demonstrate that our model can reconstruct country-level phosphate flow matrices with a high degree of accuracy, thereby enhancing traditional material flow analyses. This method bridges the gap between conventional material flow analysis and the economic analysis of resilience of national supply chains, and it is applicable not only to phosphorus but also to other resource flows. We show how the estimated flows can support country-specific assessments of supply security: while global phosphate flows appear moderately concentrated, country-level analyses reveal significant disparities in import dependencies and, in some cases, substantially higher supplier concentration.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Variables Approach to Testing Firm Conduct under a Bertrand-Nash Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding firm conduct is crucial for industrial organization and antitrust policy. In this article, we develop a testing procedure based on the Rivers and Vuong non-nested model selection framework. Unlike existing methods that require estimating the demand and supply system, our approach compares the model fit of two first-stage price regressions. Through an extensive Monte Carlo study, we demonstrate that our test performs comparably to, or outperforms, existing methods in detecting collusion across various collusive scenarios. The results are robust to model misspecification, alternative functional forms for instruments, and data limitations. By simplifying the diagnosis of firm behavior, our method offers researchers and regulators an efficient tool for assessing industry conduct under a Bertrand oligopoly framework. Additionally, our approach offers a practical guideline for enhancing the strength of BLP-style instruments in demand estimation: once collusion is detected, researchers are advised to incorporate the product characteristics of colluding partners into own-firm instruments while excluding them from other-firm instruments.</description>

      <title>Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized field experiment. Half of the 7,137 workers in the study received access to a generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that workers could change independently and not behaviors that require coordination to change: workers who used the tool in more than half of the sample weeks spent 3.6 fewer hours, or 31% less time on email each week (intent to treat estimate is 1.3 hours) and completed documents moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.</description>

      <title>AI Safety Should Prioritize the Future of Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current efforts in AI safety prioritize filtering harmful content, preventing manipulation of human behavior, and eliminating existential risks in cybersecurity or biosecurity. While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models. We strongly recommend a pro-worker framework of global AI governance to enhance shared prosperity and economic justice while reducing technical debt.</description>
