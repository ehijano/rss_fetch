      <title>Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\"ive solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.</description>

      <title>Branching $k$-path vertex cover of forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a set $P$ to be a branching $k$-path vertex cover of an undirected forest $F$ if all leaves and isolated vertices (vertices of degree at most $1$) of $F$ belong to $P$ and every path on $k$ vertices (of length $k-1$) contains either a branching vertex (a vertex of degree at least $3$) or a vertex belonging to $P$. We define the branching $k$-path vertex cover number of an undirected forest $F$, denoted by $\psi_b(F,k)$, to be the number of vertices in the smallest branching $k$-path vertex cover of $F$. These notions for a rooted directed forest are defined similarly, with natural adjustments. We prove the lower bound $\psi_b(F,k) \geq \frac{n+3k-1}{2k}$ for undirected forests, the lower bound $\psi_b(F,k) \geq \frac{n+k}{2k}$ for rooted directed forests, and that both of them are tight.</description>

      <title>Intersection patterns of set systems on manifolds with slowly growing homological shatter functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Matou\v{s}ek asserts that for any $k \ge 2$, any set system whose shatter function is $o(n^k)$ enjoys a fractional Helly theorem: in the $k$-wise intersection hypergraph, positive density implies a linear-size clique. Kalai and Meshulam conjectured a generalization of that phenomenon to homological shatter functions. It was verified for set systems with bounded homological shatter functions and ground set with a forbidden homological minor (which includes $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a homological analogue of the van Kampen-Flores theorem). We present two contributions to this line of research:
  - We study homological minors in certain manifolds (possibly with boundary), for which we prove analogues of the van Kampen-Flores theorem and of the Hanani-Tutte theorem.
  - We introduce graded analogues of the Radon and Helly numbers of set systems and relate their growth rate to the original parameters. This allows to extend the verification of the Kalai-Meshulam conjecture for sufficiently slowly growing homological shatter functions.</description>

      <title>Transducing Linear Decompositions of Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boja\'nczyk, Pilipczuk, and Grohe [LICS '18] proved that for graphs of bounded linear clique-width, clique-decompositions of bounded width can be produced by a CMSO transduction. We show that in the case of tournaments, a first-order transduction suffices. This implies that the logics CMSO and existential MSO are equivalent over bounded linear clique-width tournaments.</description>

      <title>Density Matters: A Complexity Dichotomy of Deleting Edges to Bound Subgraph Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\tau$-Bounded-Density Edge Deletion ($\tau$-BDED), where given an undirected graph $G$, the task is to remove as few edges as possible to obtain a graph $G'$ where no subgraph of $G'$ has density more than $\tau$. The density of a (sub)graph is the number of edges divided by the number of vertices. This problem was recently introduced and shown to be NP-hard for $\tau \in \{2/3, 3/4, 1 + 1/25\}$, but polynomial-time solvable for $\tau \in \{0,1/2,1\}$ [Bazgan et al., JCSS 2025]. We provide a complete dichotomy with respect to the target density $\tau$:
  1. If $2\tau \in \mathbb{N}$ (half-integral target density) or $\tau &lt; 2/3$, then $\tau$-BDED is polynomial-time solvable.
  2. Otherwise, $\tau$-BDED is NP-hard.
  We complement the NP-hardness with fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the treewidth of $G$. Moreover, for integral target density $\tau \in \mathbb{N}$, we show $\tau$-BDED to be solvable in randomized $O(m^{1 + o(1)})$ time. Our algorithmic results are based on a reduction to a new general flow problem on restricted networks that, depending on $\tau$, can be solved via Maximum s-t-Flow or General Factors. We believe this connection between these variants of flow and matching to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Constructive l2-Discrepancy Minimization with Additive Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, we algorithmically achieve Banaszczyk's bounds for both problems when $d \geq \log^2n$, which also matches the conjectured bounds. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>

      <title>Optimal Average Disk-Inspection via Fermat's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work resolves the optimal average-case cost of the Disk-Inspection problem, a variant of Bellman's 1955 lost-in-a-forest problem. In Disk-Inspection, a mobile agent starts at the center of a unit disk and follows a trajectory that inspects perimeter points whenever the disk does not obstruct visibility. The worst-case cost was solved optimally in 1957 by Isbell, but the average-case version remained open, with heuristic upper bounds proposed by Gluss in 1961 and improved only recently.
  Our approach applies Fermat's Principle of Least Time to a recently proposed discretization framework, showing that optimal solutions are captured by a one-parameter family of recurrences independent of the discretization size. In the continuum limit these recurrences give rise to a single-parameter optimal control problem, whose trajectories coincide with limiting solutions of the original Disk-Inspection problem. A crucial step is proving that the optimal initial condition generates a trajectory that avoids the unit disk, thereby validating the optics formulation and reducing the many-variable optimization to a rigorous one-parameter problem. In particular, this disproves Gluss's conjecture that optimal trajectories must touch the disk.
  Our analysis determines the exact optimal average-case inspection cost, equal to $3.549259\ldots$ and certified to at least six digits of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Vertex evaluation of multiplex graphs using Forman Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of vertices that play a central role in network analysis is a fundamental challenge. Although traditional centrality measures have been extensively employed for this purpose, the increasing complexity of modern networks necessitates the use of sophisticated metrics. The concept of Forman curvature has recently garnered significant attention as a promising approach. We define the Forman curvature for multiplex graphs, which are a category of complex networks characterized by multiple layers of connections between nodes. We then prove the key properties of the Forman curvature in the context of multiplex graphs and show its usefulness in identifying vertices occupying central positions within these networks. Moreover, through a series of comparative experiments with traditional graph features and graph kernels, we demonstrate that the Forman curvature can function as an effective metric for classifying the overall structure of networks.</description>
