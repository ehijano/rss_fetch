      <title>Optical images of massive boson stars with nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the optical imaging characteristics of massive boson stars based on a model with Einstein's nonlinear electrodynamics. Under asymptotically flat boundary conditions, the field equations are solved numerically to obtain the spacetime metric of the massive boson stars. Employing the ray-tracing method, we analyze the optical images of the massive boson stars under two illumination conditions: a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. The research reveals that the configurations and optical images of the massive boson stars can be tuned via the initial parameter $\phi_0$ and the coupling constant $\Lambda$. The absence of the event horizon in the massive boson stars results in distinct optical image characteristics compared to those of black holes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quasinormal modes, echoes, and black hole spectral instability: a brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes. We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes, highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole spacetimes are summarized.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ Gravity: A Comparative Study in Metric, Symmetric Teleparallel, and Weitzenb\"{o}ck Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified treatment of cosmic inflation within the framework of Myrzakulov Gravity, exploring its realization in three different formalisms: metric (curvature-based), teleparallel (torsion-based), and symmetric teleparallel (non-metricity-based). For each case, we derive the corresponding field equations in a flat FLRW background, study inflationary solutions driven by a scalar field, and compute observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \( r \). In addition to these geometric sectors, we extend our analysis to the more general and dynamically richer Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity, which incorporates both curvature \( R \) and torsion \( T \) in a unified action. We derive the inflationary dynamics in this hybrid model and investigate how it interpolates between pure \( f(R) \) and \( f(T) \) behaviors. The resulting framework allows for enhanced flexibility in matching Planck and BICEP/Keck observational constraints. We present analytic estimates and schematic predictions in the \( n_s \)--\( r \) plane, demonstrating that appropriately chosen parameters in \( F(R,T) \) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary signatures. This comparative and extended study highlights the potential of Myrzakulov Gravity and its generalizations to provide a consistent and geometrically motivated description of the early universe, with predictive power across different formulations of spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light and time delay in hyperbolic Einstein-Straus--de Sitter solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze strong gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric mass distribution within the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter framework in a spatially open Universe with negative curvature ($k = -1$). Applying the theory to the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we identify a critical threshold for the current scale factor $a_0$ of approximately $2.6 \times 10^{27}$ m, below which the effects of negative spatial curvature on lensing observables become significant, corresponding to a current curvature density of $|\Omega_{k0}| \gtrsim 0.0025$. In particular, for $\Omega_{k0} = -0.15$, the light bending increases slightly by about 1%, while the time delay exhibits a more substantial increase of about 10%. Beyond this threshold, however, the lensing observables are found to be insensitive to the current scale factor and converge to those characteristic of a spatially flat Universe. Importantly, our results indicate that, even where spatial curvature would otherwise enhance lensing observables, the effect of the cosmological constant remains present and acts to reduce light bending, corroborating the claim of Rindler and Ishak.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution driven by polytropic fluids in an inhomogeneous spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the ``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter. Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its parameters and evaluate its consistency.</description>

      <title>Instability of regular planar black holes in four dimensions arising from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.</description>

      <title>Extracting energy from plunging region of a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole by magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via magnetic reconnections occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency, which is opposite to those of the black hole spin and the magnetization parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem on the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS 1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of BTZ-type charged black holes in Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs) in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation, albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional gravitational background.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of FLRW universe in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity in a $D$-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the thermodynamic behavior of the apparent horizon and derive the equations of state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon. Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding to phase transitions. We determine the critical temperature and critical radius in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy. By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry in a Rotating Universe I: Conceptual Foundations and the Dirac Field in Bianchi IX Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry, has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However, it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

Abstract: We analyze from a geometric perspective the Hamiltonian formulation of a recent modification of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model where, while preserving the connection as a dynamical variable, the other field is restricted to be the exterior covariant derivative of a Lie algebra-valued function. We prove that 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms can be accommodated among the local gauge transformations of the model in addition to the internal gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Clumps as Sources of Gravitational-Wave Glitches in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of Earth, namely $\rho_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>All-sky search for long-duration gravitational-wave transients in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW signals targeted by this search are the so-called "long-duration" (&gt; 1 s) transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios involving neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Black-Hole Ringdowns with Orthonormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown signal following a BH merger can be modeled as a superposition of BH QNMs, offering a clean setup for testing gravitational theories. In particular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their frequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a technique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional QNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher computational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient Bayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs. This reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic marginalization over the mode amplitudes. We validate our approach using damped sinusoids and numerical waveforms from the SXS catalog.</description>

      <title>Hawking Temperature of Massive Charged Ads Black Hole: a Topological Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method introduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method can give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have also derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering massive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the charged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be neglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the accurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant term, which can be derived from the standard definition.</description>

      <title>Einstein Fields: A Neural Perspective To Computational General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the \emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.

      <title>Testing the effective action approach to bubble nucleation in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently been explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important complement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically require finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as critical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative is to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary theory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting lower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically truncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set aside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe scalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary conditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action and by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s &lt; M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential Weyl calculus on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for Weyl quantization on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, in which pseudodifferential operators act on sections of vector bundles equipped with arbitrary connections. We construct the associated star product and compute its semiclassical expansion up to third order in the expansion parameter. A central feature of our approach is a one-to-one correspondence between formally self-adjoint symbols and formally self-adjoint operators, extending known results from flat space to curved geometries. In addition, we analyze the Moyal equation satisfied by the Wigner function in this setting and provide explicit computations of Weyl symbols for several physically significant operators, including the Dirac, Maxwell, linearized Yang-Mills, and linearized Einstein operators. Our results lay the foundation for future developments in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, semiclassical analysis, and chiral kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Torsion induced current-scalaron coupling in Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the matter current couplings with the scalar degrees of freedom originated from the torsion in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity. It has been shown in previous studies that the presence of the operators consisting of torsion components up to dimension four can naturally induce a (pseudo-)scalar degree of freedom, the scalaron. In this work, we consider the couplings between torsion and matter currents in this framework, and show that they can lead to couplings between these currents and the scalaron in the equivalent metric theory. We consider both gauge-invariant and gauge-dependent currents, showing general results and several concrete examples. These results are useful for the discussion of particle production processes after inflation in the EC framework, such as reheating and baryogenesis, and show the connection to the QCD $\theta$ term.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Exterior Generalised Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the aim of this paper to transfer to generalised geometry tools employed in the study of semi-Riemannian immersions, specializing at times to semi-Riemannian hypersurfaces.
  Given an exact Courant algebroid $E \to M$ and an immersion $\iota\colon N \hookrightarrow M$, there is a well-known construction of an exact Courant algebroid $\iota^! E \to N$, the pullback of $E$. This paper explains the pullback of generalised metrics and divergence operators. Assuming $N$ is a hypersurface, it develops the notion of generalised exterior curvature, introducing the generalised second fundamental form and the generalised mean curvature. Generalised versions of the Gau{\ss}-Codazzi equations are obtained. As an application, the constraint equations for the initial value formulation of the generalised Einstein equations are established in the formalism of generalised geometry. Further applications include a generalised geometry version of the fundamental theorem for hypersurfaces and the result that generalised K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler structures restrict to submanifolds compatible with the generalised almost complex structure. In particular, we characterise exact semi-Riemannian Courant algebroids which are flat with respect to the canonical generalised connection. These play the role of the ambient space in the fundamental theorem mentioned above.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of out-of-equilibrium dense viscous fluids is of key importance to accurate descriptions of physical systems such as compact stars, particularly their mergers. We consider a near-equilibrium relativistic fluid with $n$ independent and small chemical potentials restoring the system back towards equilibrium. By diagonalising the evolution equation for the out-of-equilibrium chemical potentials, we construct an explicit evolution equation for the bulk scalar of the system in second-order hydrodynamics in terms of equilibrium quantities. We find expressions for the $2n$ transport quantities and show that in the rest frame of the fluid, the system admits a Green's function corresponding to an $n$-component fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.</description>

      <title>The BAO-CMB Tension and Implications for Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the high-dimensional dyonic AdS black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet background. We first examine the topological charge connected to the critical point and find that the two conventional critical points $CP_{1},CP_{2}$ of the black hole are physical critical point, and the novel critical point $CP_{3}$ that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free energy ($\alpha=0.5$). The critical points $CP_{1}$ and $CP_{2}$ are observed to occur at the maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical point $CP_{3}$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature. Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical points. With the increase of the coupling constant ($\alpha = 1$), although the system has three critical points, only the conventional $CP_{1}$ is a (physical) critical point, and the conventional $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase annihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $\alpha$ has significant impact on the phase structure. Additionally, we regard dyonic AdS black holes as a topological defect within the thermodynamic space, our findings indicate that alterations in pressure can result in the system exhibiting distinct points of generation and annihilation. However, the total topological number of black holes in different dimensions is $1$, the system shares a similar topological classification as the charged RN-AdS black holes. The discovery we have made provides a crucial component in understanding the thermodynamic topology of dyonic AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Constraining the modified friction in gravitational wave propagation with precessing black hole binaries</title>

Abstract: A broad class of modified gravities can result in a modified friction effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). This effect changes the amplitude-damping rate of GWs during their propagation in the cosmological distance and thus modifies the standard luminosity distance of GWs in general relativity. Therefore, one can constrain this modified friction by measuring both the luminosity distance and redshift of the GW sources. In this paper, we investigate the prospects of constraining such modified friction effects by using the precessing binary black holes with ground-based GW detectors. For this purpose, we consider 20 precessing events detected by the GW detector network consisting of two LIGO detectors and two third-generation GW detectors (the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer). The redshift information of these events is obtained by identifying their possible host galaxies in the GLADE+ galaxy catalog. We show that the precession in the binary system can significantly improve the precision of the luminosity distance and thus lead to a tighter constraint on the modified friction. By assuming narrow priors on cosmological parameters that are consistent with the uncertainties of Planck 2018 results, our analysis shows that the modified friction effect, characterized by two parameters $(\Xi_0, n)$, can be constrained to be $\Xi_0 = 1.002^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$ and $n=3.257^{+2.595}_{-2.192}$, in which the result of $\Xi_0$ is about 2 orders of magnitude better than current results from an analysis with GWTC-3. Our result sets the stage for future research with third-generation GW detectors, offering new insights into gravitational parameter modifications. It also contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of binary black hole systems with precession.</description>

      <title>Fluid-membrane Descriptions of Various Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The membrane paradigm of black holes is an effective theory that replaces the event horizon with a fictitious yet tangible fluid. It has provided us with valuable insights, especially in understanding the environment of black holes. The paradigm establishes a fluid/gravity correspondence that allows the computation of the thermal properties of the black hole in terms of the transport coefficients of the fluid. Recently, we showed that this is a van der Waals-type fluid for Kerr and especially for Johannsen-Psaltis black holes. Here, we use the paradigm to study the properties of various black holes in different dimensions to test the predictive capacity of effective theory. Among these, for the BTZ black holes, the paradigm gives a physical bulk viscosity, unlike the generic examples, for which the paradigm works with a negative bulk viscosity. For Lorentz-violating black holes, we demonstrate that the parameter for Lorentz violation is seen as a hair under the paradigm, which shifts the ergoregion where the fluid pressure diverges. It might have a consequence for black hole jets. For asymptotically safe quantum-corrected black holes, the paradigm detects the final state of evaporation, i.e., a remnant with a correct value for the mass that still has an event horizon. Finally, we check the paradigm with stringy black holes that have dilatonic and axionic charges, and the fluid produces the known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalization of the cloud of strings model originally proposed by Letelier, by introducing a magnetic-like component, $\Sigma_{23}$, in addition to the electric-like component, $\Sigma_{01}$, considered in the original formulation. This extension leads to a new black hole solution of the form \begin{equation}
  f(r) = 1 - \frac{2M}{r} + \frac{g_s^2 \ell_s^2}{r^2} \, {}_2F_1\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, -\frac{r^4}{\ell_s^4}\right), \end{equation} where ${}_2F_1$ denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric function. The solution is characterized by the string length $\ell_s$ and the string coupling constant $g_s$ yields the condition $0 &lt; a &lt; 1$, which now emerges from the model itself, ensuring both energy positivity and the existence of horizons-rather than being imposed ad hoc. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of the resulting black hole, and find that the entropy remains consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, $S = A/4$, in agreement with several string-theoretic derivations.</description>

      <title>Robustness of extracting quasinormal mode information from black hole merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In linear perturbation theory, the ringdown of a gravitational wave (GW) signal is described by a linear combination of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Detecting QNMs from GW signals is a promising way to test GR, central to the developing field of black-hole spectroscopy. More robust black-hole spectroscopy tests could also consider the ringdown amplitude-phase consistency. That requires an accurate understanding of the excitation and stability of the QNM expansion coefficients. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the extracted $m=2$ QNM coefficients obtained from a high-accuracy numerical relativity waveform. We explore a framework to assess the robustness of QNM coefficients. Within this framework, we not only consider the traditional criterion related to the constancy of a QNM's expansion coefficients over a window in time, but also emphasize the importance of consistency among fitting models. In addition, we implement an iterative greedy approach within which we fix certain QNM coefficients. We apply this approach to linear fitting, and to nonlinear fitting where the properties of the remnant black hole are treated as unknown variables. We find that the robustness of overtone coefficients is enhanced by our greedy approach, particularly for the $(2,2,2,+)$ overtone. Based on our robustness criteria applied to the $m=2$ signal modes, we find the $(2\!\sim\!4,2,0,+)$ and $(2,2,1\!\sim\!2,+)$ modes are robust, while the $(3,2,1,+)$ subdominant mode is only marginally robust. After we subtract the contributions of the $(2\!\sim\!4,2,0,+)$ and $(2\!\sim\!3,2,1,+)$ QNMs from signal mode $(4,2)$, we also find evidence for the quadratic QNM $(2,1,0,+)\times(2,1,0,+)$.</description>

      <title>A Directive for Obtaining Algebraically General Solutions of Einstein Equations Based on the Canonical Killing Tensor Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work follows earlier investigations in which the existence of canonical Killing tensor forms and the application of general null tetrad transformations led to a variety of solutions (Petrov types D, III, N) in vacuum spacetimes with a cosmological constant. Among those, a distinct Petrov type D family was identified, characterized by a topological product of two-dimensional constant-curvature spaces and a shear-free, non-diverging, non-geodesic null congruence admitting the second canonical form. This family is derived and presented here in full detail. In addition, an algebraically general solution with a curvature singularity, describing a non-stationary cylindrically symmetric spacetime, also exhibiting a shear-free, non-diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence, is introduced. This solution arises from the same canonical form, developed through the application of Lorentz transformations within the framework of symmetric null tetrads. On this basis, we propose a new directive: by assuming the canonical forms of Killing tensors and implementing Lorentz transformations within the symmetric null tetrad concept, a broader class of algebraically general solutions of Einstein's equations can be derived.</description>

      <title>Einstein ring of dust shells with quantum hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information about the internal structure of a compact object is classically inaccessible to external observers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum corrections to gravitational fields can reveal the internal structure of compact objects composed of dust shells. Using an effective field theory approach to incorporate quantum corrections up to second order in curvature, we derive a quantum-corrected metric for $N$ uniformly spaced shells with equal surface mass density and then examine how these corrections manifest in the deflection angle for gravitational lensing. In particular, we mainly investigate quantum-corrected astrophysical observables such as the Einstein ring and image magnification. Compared to the classical scenario, the deflection angle and the corresponding Einstein angle differ by a term that depends explicitly on the number of dust shells, which play the role of quantum hair. Specifically, the quantum correction to them diminishes as $N$ increases, yet a finite deviation from the classical result remains even in the continuum limit $N\to\infty$. Consequently, our results show that the internal structures of compact objects with identical mass and radius can be distinguished by quantum hair through their lensing observables.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency for a gyroscope in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 11-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector boson stars, also known as Proca stars, exhibit remarkable dynamical robustness, making them strong candidates for potential astrophysical exotic compact objects. In search of theoretically well-motivated Proca star models, we recently introduced the $\ell$-Proca star, a multi-field extension of the spherical Proca star, whose $(2\ell + 1)$ constitutive fields have the same time and radial dependence, and their angular structure is given by all the available spherical harmonics for a fixed angular momentum number $\ell$. In this work, we conduct a non-linear stability analysis of these stars by numerically solving the Einstein-(multi, complex) Proca system for the case of $\ell = 2$, which are formed by five constitutive independent, complex Proca fields with $m = 0, |1|$, and $|2|$. Our analysis is based on long-term, fully non-linear, 3-dimensional numerical-relativity simulations without imposing any symmetry. We find that ($\ell=2$)-Proca stars are unstable throughout their entire domain of existence. In particular, we highlight that less compact configurations dynamically lose their global spherical symmetry, developing a non-axisymmetric $\tilde{m}=4$ mode instability and a subsequent migration into a new kind of multi-field Proca star formed by fields with different angular momentum number, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$, that we identify as unstable multi-$\ell$ Proca stars.</description>

      <title>The fault in our sirens: Hierarchical diagnosis of waveform systematics in Hubble-Lema\^itre constant measurements</title>

Abstract: Cosmological inference using a population of binary black-hole mergers, combined with a galaxy catalog, presents an exciting opportunity for precision cosmology with the possibility of resolving the Hubble tension. However, the accuracy of these measurements heavily relies on the quality of the model used to infer the binary parameters, including the model of the gravitational-wave signal. We use state-of-the-art waveform models to explore the impact of inaccurate modeling in measuring the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant for the upcoming and future ground-based gravitational-wave observatories. We diagnose the presence of inaccuracies within a hierarchical population-analysis framework, without a priori knowing the true value of the parameter, by assessing the consistency of the distribution of individual posteriors in relation to their measurement errors. Our findings indicate that even a small high-mass, spin-precessing subpopulation -- comprising as little as 5\% of the population generating the events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration so far -- can result in an unreliable measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant in the upcoming observing runs of these detectors, with even more pronounced effects expected in future facilities on the ground.</description>

Abstract: We prove small data energy estimates of all orders of differentiability between past null infinity and future null infinity of de Sitter space for the conformally invariant Maxwell-scalar field system. This allows us to construct bounded and invertible, but nonlinear, scattering operators taking past asymptotic data to future asymptotic data. We also deduce exponential decay rates for solutions with data having at least two derivatives, and for more regular solutions discover an asymptotic decoupling of the scalar field from the charge. The construction involves a carefully chosen complete gauge fixing condition which allows us to control all components of the Maxwell potential, and a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality for higher order estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corner Symmetry: Representations and Gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The corner symmetry algebra organises the physical charges induced by gravity on codimension-$2$ corners of a manifold. In this letter, we initiate a study of the quantum properties of this group using as a toy model the corner symmetry group of two-dimensional gravity $\mathrm{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$. We first describe the central extensions and how the quantum corner symmetry group arises and give the Casimirs. We then make use of one particular representation to discuss the gluing of corners, achieved by identifying the maximal commuting sub-algebra. This is a concrete implementation of the gravitational constraints at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nonextensive Entropy Holographic Dark Energy Models Verified by Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for studying generalized Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models in which we use a dimensionless form of the area-entropy of cosmological horizons. The future event horizon is applied though the formalism can also be applied to any other type of the horizon, too. Then, we use our formalism for nonextensive horizon entropies of standard HDE (i.e. Bekenstein-Hawking), and generalized such as Barrow/Tsallis-Cirto, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis as dark energy models of the universe and test them by cosmological data.
  We find the bounds on the specific entropy model parameters and also apply statistical comparison tool such as the Bayesian evidence criterion in order to favour or disfavour the models against standard $\Lambda$CDM.
  The main data test results are that all the HDE models under study are statistically disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, though at some different levels. The standard HDE seem to be on the same footing as R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis HDE models since the latter include only small deviations from HDE model resulting from the series expansion of their extra nonextensivity parameters. However, Barrow and Tsallis-Cirto models, though still disfavoured against $\Lambda$CDM, seem to point out observationally to fulfil an important physical property of extensivity (though still remaining nonadditive). Finally, the Tsallis-Cirto model parameter is pointing towards the $\Lambda$CDM limit which is singular also at the expense of having much larger value of the holographic dark energy dimensionless parameter $k$ value higher than other models.</description>

      <title>Wormholes with Ends of the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) related to universal asymptotics of OPE data extracted from 2D conformal bootstrap. Conical defects connect BCFT bulk operators; branes join BCFT boundary intervals with identical boundary conditions; kinks (1D defects along branes) link BCFT boundary operators; and punctures (0D defects) are endpoints where conical defects terminate on branes. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>de Sitter Holography and Carrollian Brane Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was discovered in recent months that the anti-de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds involved in all familiar top-down examples of AdS/CFT duality follow from applying a transverse nonrelativistic brane limit to string/M theory on (asymptotically) flat spacetime. In this note we show that an exactly analogous statement holds for de Sitter (dS) backgrounds relevant to particular instances of dS/CFT duality, which are obtained via a longitudinal Carrollian brane limit. This statement makes direct contact with the holographic duality inferred by Hull via temporal T-duality.</description>
