      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic and uncertain societal-scale systems. In these systems, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often acting without any information about other agents. The design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remain elusive, especially beyond Markov zero-sum games and Markov potential games, which do not adequately capture the nature of many real-world interactions that is neither fully competitive nor fully cooperative. This paper investigates the design of decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide provable guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in the long run. Our approach builds on constructing a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) to address the intractability of designing algorithms that converge to exact Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that MNPFs play a central role in ensuring the convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning algorithm to approximate Nash equilibria. By leveraging a two-timescale approach, where Q-function estimates are updated faster than policy updates, we show that the system converges to a level set of the MNPF over the set of approximate Nash equilibria. This convergence result is further strengthened if the set of Nash equilibria is assumed to be finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis and design of decentralized learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-agent Policy-based Directed Hypergraph Learning for Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods that incorporate graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for intelligent traffic signal control, which aims to coordinate traffic signals effectively across multiple intersections. Despite this progress, the standard graph learning used in these methods still struggles to capture higher-order correlations in real-world traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization framework DHG-PPO, which incorporates PPO and directed hypergraph module to extract the spatio-temporal attributes of the road networks. DHG-PPO enables multiple agents to ingeniously interact through the dynamical construction of hypergraph. The effectiveness of DHG-PPO is validated in terms of average travel time and throughput against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Multi-Vehicle Navigation in Unstructured Environments using Hard Sample Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary research in autonomous driving has demonstrated tremendous potential in emulating the traits of human driving. However, they primarily cater to areas with well built road infrastructure and appropriate traffic management systems. Therefore, in the absence of traffic signals or in unstructured environments, these self-driving algorithms are expected to fail. This paper proposes a strategy for autonomously navigating multiple vehicles in close proximity to their desired destinations without traffic rules in unstructured environments.
  Graphical Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated good utility for this task of multi-vehicle control. Among the different alternatives of training GNNs, supervised methods have proven to be most data-efficient, albeit require ground truth labels. However, these labels may not always be available, particularly in unstructured environments without traffic regulations. Therefore, a tedious optimization process may be required to determine them while ensuring that the vehicles reach their desired destination and do not collide with each other or any obstacles. Therefore, in order to expedite the training process, it is essential to reduce the optimization time and select only those samples for labeling that add most value to the training. In this paper, we propose a warm start method that first uses a pre-trained model trained on a simpler subset of data. Inference is then done on more complicated scenarios, to determine the hard samples wherein the model faces the greatest predicament. This is measured by the difficulty vehicles encounter in reaching their desired destination without collision. Experimental results demonstrate that mining for hard samples in this manner reduces the requirement for supervised training data by 10 fold.

      <title>Adaptation Procedure in Misinformation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interactions between agents in multi-agent systems, in which the agents are misinformed with regards to the game that they play, essentially having a subjective and incorrect understanding of the setting, without being aware of it. For that, we introduce a new game-theoretic concept, called misinformation games, that provides the necessary toolkit to study this situation. Subsequently, we enhance this framework by developing a time-discrete procedure (called the Adaptation Procedure) that captures iterative interactions in the above context. During the Adaptation Procedure, the agents update their information and reassess their behaviour in each step. We demonstrate our ideas through an implementation, which is used to study the efficiency and characteristics of the Adaptation Procedure.</description>

      <title>Limiting Computation Levels in Prioritized Trajectory Planning with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prioritized planning for vehicles, vehicles plan trajectories in parallel or in sequence. Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</description>

      <title>Random walk model that universally generates inverse square L\'evy walk by eliminating search cost minimization constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L\'evy walk, a type of random walk characterized by linear step lengths that follow a power-law distribution, is observed in the migratory behaviors of various organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Notably, L\'evy walks with power exponents close to two are frequently observed, though their underlying causes remain elusive. This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square L\'evy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern. However, removing this constraint transitions the movement to an inverse square L\'evy walk. Therefore, by modulating the prioritization of search costs, our model can seamlessly alternate between Brownian and Cauchy walk dynamics. This model has the potential to be utilized for exploring the parameter space of an optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents: Towards a Sociotechnical Understanding of Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Identification of LFT Structured Descriptor Systems with Slow and Non-uniform Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time domain identification is studied in this paper for parameters of a continuous-time multi-input multi-output descriptor system, with these parameters affecting system matrices through a linear fractional transformation. Sampling is permitted to be slow and non-uniform, and there are no necessities to satisfy the Nyquist frequency restrictions. This model can be used to described the behaviors of a networked dynamic system, and the obtained results can be straightforwardly applied to an ordinary state-space model, as well as a lumped system. An explicit formula is obtained respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the system stimulated by an arbitrary signal. Some relations have been derived between the system steady-state response and its transfer function matrix (TFM), which reveal that the value of a TFM at almost any interested point, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction, can in principle be estimated from input-output experimental data. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the descriptor system and the values of its TFM. Their properties like asymptotic unbiasedness, consistency, etc., are analyzed. A simple numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structure and Polynomial-time Algorithm of Game Equilibriums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) exists for game equilibriums has been an open question, and the absence of this polynomial-time algorithm has indications and consequences in three fields, such as the practicality of methods in algorithmic game theory, non-stationarity and curse of multiagency in MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning), and the tractability of PPAD in computational complexity theory. In this paper, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, which leads to a fundamental leap in the understanding of game equilibriums. Regarding the equilibrium bundle, first, we formalize perfect equilibriums of dynamic games as the zero points of its canonical section, second, we formalize a hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method as a line search on it, such that the method is an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, implying PPAD=FP, third, we give the existence and oddness theorems of it as an extension of those of Nash equilibriums. As intermediate results, we introduce a concept called policy cone to give the sufficient and necessary condition for dynamic programming to converge to perfect equilibriums, and introduce two concepts called unbiased barrier problem and unbiased KKT conditions to make the interior point method to approximate Nash equilibriums. In experiment, the line search process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated dynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.</description>

      <title>Resilient Fleet Management for Energy-Aware Intra-Factory Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>
