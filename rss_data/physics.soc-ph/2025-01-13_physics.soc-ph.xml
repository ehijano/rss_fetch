      <title>Thermodynamics of harmony: extending the analogy across musical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common for most people to think of science and art as disparate, or at most only vaguely related fields. In physics, one of the biggest successes of thermodynamics is its explanation of order arising from disordered phases of matter through the minimization of free energy; In 2019, Berezovsky showed that the mechanism describing emergent order from disorder in matter can be used to explain how ordered sets of pitches can arise out of disordered sound, thus bridging the gap between science and the arts in a powerful way. In this paper we analyze his method in detail, generalizing it beyond the 12 tone system of intonation of Western music by explicitly considering Gamelan instruments and clarifying some details in the hope of strengthening it and making it better known and recognized.</description>

      <title>Towards an Ontology of Traceable Impact Management in the Food Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of quality improvements and accountability in the food supply chains, especially how they relate to food-related outcomes, such as hunger, has become increasingly vital, necessitating a comprehensive approach that encompasses product quality and its impact on various stakeholders and their communities. Such an approach offers numerous benefits in increasing product quality and eliminating superfluous measurements while appraising and alleviating the broader societal and environmental repercussions. A traceable impact management model (TIMM) provides an impact structure and a reporting mechanism that identifies each stakeholder's role in the total impact of food production and consumption stages.
  The model aims to increase traceability's utility in understanding the impact of changes on communities affected by food production and consumption, aligning with current and future government requirements, and addressing the needs of communities and consumers. This holistic approach is further supported by an ontological model that forms the logical foundation and a unified terminology. By proposing a holistic and integrated solution across multiple stakeholders, the model emphasizes quality and the extensive impact of championing accountability, sustainability, and responsible practices with global traceability.
  With these combined efforts, the food supply chain moves toward a global tracking and tracing process that not only ensures product quality but also addresses its impact on a broader scale, fostering accountability, sustainability, and responsible food production and consumption.</description>

      <title>The Norwegian-Polish CCS Network: A Case Study in Bilateral Collaboration for European Climate Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the face of escalating climate change, achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-abate industrial sectors is imperative. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represents an essential technological advancement to achieve sustainable decarbonization. This manuscript reports on the bilateral CCS network between Norway and Poland, designed and implemented to leverage their capabilities to expedite technology deployment via mutual cooperation and accelerate CCS initiatives targeted to member states' challenges across Europe, aiming for a meaningful contribution to climate goals. Norway is renowned for its operational acumen, as demonstrated by landmark projects like Sleipner and Snohvit, and its forward-looking initiatives, such as the open-source cross-border Northern Lights project, which offers advanced infrastructure and expertise. Conversely, Poland, characterized by its coal-dependent economy and the challenge of decarbonizing extensive industrial emissions, presents a significant geological CO$_2$ storage potential, estimated at over 200 gigatonnes. This study delves into the potential synergies derived from collaborative endeavors in academic education, research and development, industrial implementation, regulatory coherence, and public engagement. By underscoring the reciprocal benefits of such partnership, the study underscores the indispensable role of bilateral cooperation in harnessing CCS's capabilities to meet ambitious climate objectives, paving the way toward a sustainable and low-carbon future. Additionally, it outlines a scalable model for fostering and supporting broader bi- and multi-lateral collaborations, emphasizing the pivotal role of interconnected networks in shaping effective global climate action strategies.</description>

      <title>Impacts of EPA's Finalized Power Plant Greenhouse Gas Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inflation Reduction Act subsidizes the deployment of clean electricity, hydrogen production, and carbon capture and storage, which could enable additional actions by other federal, state, and local policymakers to reduce emissions. Power plant rules finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2024 are one such example of complementary policies. The rules establish emissions intensity standards, not technology mandates, meaning power plant owners can choose from a range of technologies and control options provided that emissions standards are met. This flexibility makes electricity systems modeling important to understand the potential effects of these regulations. We report below a multi-model analysis of the EPA power plant rules that can provide timely information, including for other countries and states, on emissions impacts, policy design for electricity decarbonization, power sector investments and retirements, cost impacts, and load growth. We also discuss related technical, political, and legal uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. We find that the unsigned Men\'eame network accurately delineates ideological communities, but negative ties are necessary for detecting extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors. We also show that far-left users are more likely to use negative interactions to engage across ideological lines, while far-right users interact primarily with users similar to themselves.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the Kuramoto model with asymmetric higher order interactions of arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher order interactions can lead to new equilibrium states and bifurcations in systems of coupled oscillators described by the Kuramoto model. However, even in the simplest case of 3-body interactions there are more than one possible functional forms, depending on how exactly the bodies are coupled. Which of these forms is better suited to describe the dynamics of the oscillators depends on the specific system under consideration. Here we show that, for a particular class of interactions, reduced equations for the Kuramoto order parameter can be derived for arbitrarily many bodies. Moreover, the contribution of a given term to the reduced equation does not depend on its order, but on a certain effective order, that we define. We give explicit examples where bi and tri-stability is found and discuss a few exotic cases where synchronization happens via a third order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Data driven discovery of human mobility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility is a fundamental aspect of social behavior, with broad applications in transportation, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. However, for decades new mathematical formulas to model mobility phenomena have been scarce and usually discovered by analogy to physical processes, such as the gravity model and the radiation model. These sporadic discoveries are often thought to rely on intuition and luck in fitting empirical data. Here, we propose a systematic approach that leverages symbolic regression to automatically discover interpretable models from human mobility data. Our approach finds several well-known formulas, such as the distance decay effect and classical gravity models, as well as previously unknown ones, such as an exponential-power-law decay that can be explained by the maximum entropy principle. By relaxing the constraints on the complexity of model expressions, we further show how key variables of human mobility are progressively incorporated into the model, making this framework a powerful tool for revealing the underlying mathematical structures of complex social phenomena directly from observational data.</description>

      <title>The Waters We Swim In: Replicability and the Evolution of Scientific Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a series of high-profile retractions and fraud cases have arisen in physics, sparking a conversation about research integrity and replicability. Here, we discuss how the practice of science is shaped by the social and political context in which it operates. Reflection on our norms and values could provide a route to create community-driven safeguards that respond to the changing demands in which our research occurs. We propose that collaborations between physicists, philosophers, social scientists, and historians of science could facilitate these reflections and provide new ideas for social science and humanities colleagues.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A social network is often divided into many factions. People are friends within each faction, while they are enemies of the other factions, and even my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend. This configuration can be described in terms of a weak form of structural balance. Although weak balance explains a number of real social networks, which dynamical rule achieves it has remained unexplored. In this work, we show that the answer can be found in the field of indirect reciprocity, which assumes that people assess each other's behavior and choose how to behave to others based on the assessment according to a social norm. We begin by showing that weak structural balance is equivalent to stationarity when the rule is given by a norm called `judging'. By analyzing its cluster dynamics of merging, division, and migration induced by assessment error in complete graphs, we obtain the cluster size distribution in a steady state, which shows the coexistence of a giant cluster and smaller ones. We compare this shape with the distributions of seats among the parties in the parliaments of Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain. This study suggests that indirect reciprocity can provide insight into the interplay between a norm that individuals abide by and the macroscopic group structure in society.</description>

      <title>The improvement in transmission resilience metrics from reduced outages or faster restoration can be calculated by rerunning historical outage data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission utilities routinely collect detailed outage data, including resilience events in which outages bunch up due to weather. The resilience events and their resilience metrics can readily be extracted from this historical outage data. Improvements such as grid hardening or investments in restoration lead to reduced outages or faster restoration. We show how to rerun this history with the effects of the reduced outages or faster restoration included to find the resulting improvement in resilience metrics, thus quantifying the benefits of these investments. This is demonstrated with case studies for specific events (a derecho and a hurricane), and all large events or large thunderstorms in the Midwest USA. Instead of predicting future extreme events with models, which is very challenging, the historical rerun readily quantifies the benefits that a resilience investment would have had if it had been made in the past. The historical rerun is particularly vivid in making the case for resilience investments to stakeholders because it quantifies the benefits for events actually experienced by those stakeholders, rather than for future events predicted with uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Identifying rich clubs in spatiotemporal interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial networks are widely used in various fields to represent and analyze interactions or relationships between locations or spatially distributed entities.There is a network science concept known as the 'rich club' phenomenon, which describes the tendency of 'rich' nodes to form densely interconnected sub-networks. Although there are established methods to quantify topological, weighted, and temporal rich clubs individually, there is limited research on measuring the rich club effect in spatially-weighted temporal networks, which could be particularly useful for studying dynamic spatial interaction networks. To address this gap, we introduce the spatially-weighted temporal rich club (WTRC), a metric that quantifies the strength and consistency of connections between rich nodes in a spatiotemporal network. Additionally, we present a unified rich club framework that distinguishes the WTRC effect from other rich club effects, providing a way to measure topological, weighted, and temporal rich club effects together. Through two case studies of human mobility networks at different spatial scales, we demonstrate how the WTRC is able to identify significant weighted temporal rich club effects, whereas the unweighted equivalent in the same network either fails to detect a rich club effect or inaccurately estimates its significance. In each case study, we explore the spatial layout and temporal variations revealed by the WTRC analysis, showcasing its particular value in studying spatiotemporal interaction networks. This research offers new insights into the study of spatiotemporal networks, with critical implications for applications such as transportation, redistricting, and epidemiology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of art and science offers novel ways to interpret and represent complex phenomena. This project explores the convergence of high-energy astrophysics, concrete poetry, and natural language processing (NLP) by proposing a Markov chain-based algorithm that generates poetic texts from gamma-ray emission maps of the universe. Gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, arise from violent astrophysical processes such as supernovae, pulsars, and black hole accretion, observable through instruments like the \textit{Fermi Large Area Telescope} (FermiLAT). These high-energy events are mapped and processed into matrices, treated as Markov chains, where each state's transition probability is determined by the intensity of gamma-ray sources in a region of interest.</description>

      <title>Social adaptive behavior and oscillatory prevalence in an epidemic model on evolving random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic amply shows that spatial effects like the mobility of agents and average interpersonal distance, together with the adaptation of agents, are very important in deciding the outcome of epidemic dynamics. Structural and dynamical aspects of random geometric graphs are widely employed in describing processes with a spatial dependence, such as the spread of an airborne disease. In this work, we investigate the interplay between spatial factors, such as agent mobility and average interpersonal distance, and the adaptive responses of individuals to an ongoing epidemic within the framework of random geometric graphs. We show that such spatial factors, together with the adaptive behavior of the agents in response to the prevailing level of global epidemic, can give rise to oscillatory prevalence even with the classical SIR framework. We characterize in detail the effects of social adaptation and mobility of agents on the disease dynamics and obtain the threshold values. We also study the effects of delayed adaptive response of agents on epidemic dynamics. We show that a delay in executing non-pharmaceutical spatial mitigation strategies can amplify oscillatory prevalence tendencies and can have non-linear effects on peak prevalence. This underscores the importance of early implementation of adaptive strategies coupled with the dissemination of real-time prevalence information to manage and control the epidemic effectively.</description>

      <title>Modelling competition for space: Emergent inefficiency and inequality due to spatial self-organization among a group of crowd-avoiding agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition for a limited resource is the hallmark of many complex systems, and often, that resource turns out to be the physical space itself. In this work, we study a novel model designed to elucidate the dynamics and emergence in complex adaptive systems in which agents compete for some spatially spread resource. Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that inefficiency in utilizing physical space shows transition at a specific density and peaks at another distinct density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the variation of inefficiency relative to the information accessible to the agents exhibits contrasting behavior above and below this second density. We also look into the inequality of resource sharing in the model and show that although inefficiency can be a non-monotonic function of information depending upon the parameters of the model, inequality, in general, decreases with information. Our study sheds light on the role of competition, spatial constraints, and agent traits within complex adaptive systems, offering insights into their emergent behaviors.</description>

Backward contact tracing, which tracks the sources of infection, proved crucial in places like Japan for identifying COVID-19 infections from superspreading events. This paper presents a novel perspective of digital contact tracing as online graph exploration and addresses the forward and backward contact tracing problem as a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation problem using iterative epidemic network data sampling. The challenge lies in the combinatorial complexity and rapid spread of infections. We introduce DeepTrace, an algorithm based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that iteratively updates its estimations as new contact tracing data is collected, learning to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation by utilizing topological features to accelerate learning and improve convergence. The contact tracing process combines either BFS or DFS to expand the network and trace the infection source, ensuring comprehensive and efficient exploration. Additionally, the GNN model is fine-tuned through a two-phase approach: pre-training with synthetic networks to approximate likelihood probabilities and fine-tuning with high-quality data to refine the model. Using COVID-19 variant data, we illustrate that DeepTrace surpasses current methods in identifying superspreaders, providing a robust basis for a scalable digital contact tracing strategy.</description>
