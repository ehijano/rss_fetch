      <title>Effect of an electric field on liquid helium scintillation produced by fast electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.03061v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependence on applied electric field ($0 - 40$ kV/cm) of the scintillation light produced by fast electrons and $\alpha$ particles stopped in liquid helium in the temperature range of 0.44 K to 3.12 K is reported. For both types of particles, the reduction in the intensity of the scintillation signal due to the applied field exhibits an apparent temperature dependence. Using an approximate solution of the Debye-Smoluchowski equation, we show that the apparent temperature dependence for electrons can be explained by the time required for geminate pairs to recombine relative to the detector signal integration time. This finding indicates that the spatial distribution of secondary electrons with respect to their geminate partners possesses a heavy, non-Gaussian tail at larger separations, and has a dependence on the energy of the primary ionization electron. We discuss the potential application of this result to pulse shape analysis for particle detection and discrimination.</description>

      <title>Generalised hydrogen interactions with $\texttt{CINCO}$: a window to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present semi-analytic solutions for atomic transition rates in hydrogenic atoms induced by scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor interactions. Our results agree with quantum electrodynamics predictions to $\sim 0.005\,\%$ precision, and further allow us to calculate absorption and emission rates for axions, hidden photons, light scalars or other dark matter candidates for hydrogen and hydrogenic ions. These results can be used to inform searches for light new physics as well as in calculations relevant to searches for fifth forces or varying fundamental constants, with applications from astrophysics to laboratory spectroscopy experiments. We also provide a dedicated tool for the construction of hydrogenic transition amplitudes: "Computation of hydrogen radial INtegrals and COefficients" ($\texttt{CINCO}$).</description>

      <title>Apparatus for Optical-Atomic System Integration &amp; Calibration: 1 atm to 1$\times$10$^{-11}$ Torr in 24h</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms exquisitely controlled by lasers are the quantum foundation, particularly for sensing, timekeeping, and computing, of state-of-the-art quantum science and technology. However, the laboratory-scale infrastructure for such optical-atomic quantum apparatuses rarely translates into commercial applications. A promising solution is miniaturizing the optical layouts onto a chip-scale device integrated with cold atoms inside a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. For prototyping purposes, however, rapidly loading or exchanging test photonic devices into a UHV chamber is limited by the evacuation time from atmospheric pressures to the optimal pressures for ultracold atoms of $1\times10^{-11}$ Torr, a process typically taking weeks or months without cryogenics. Here, we present a loadlock apparatus and loading procedure capable of venting, exchanging, and evacuating back to $&lt;1\times10^{-11}$ Torr in under 24 hours. Our system allows for rapid testing and benchmarking of various photonic devices with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Sound in a Tunable Fermi Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau's theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound, and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we observe the shape of the quasiparticle excitations directly from momentum-space tomography and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau's theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.</description>

      <title>Radiative decay of muonic molecules in resonance states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we theoretically investigated x-ray spectra from the radiative decay of muonic deuterium molecules dd$\mu$ in resonance states, which plays an important role in a new kinetic model of muon catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF). The resonance states are Feshbach resonances located below the d$\mu$($n=2$) + d threshold energy and radiatively decay into the continuum or bound states. The x-ray spectra having characteristic shapes according to the radial distribution of the two nuclei are obtained using precise three-body wave functions. We carefully examined the convergence of the x-ray spectra and achieved agreements between the length- and velocity-gauge calculations. We revealed a non-adiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay becomes a heating source of muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch that directly results in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states dd$\mu^\ast$ and dt$\mu^\ast$ are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the $\mu$CF cycle which skips a slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the $\mu$CF cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of $1.5$--$1.997$ keV, which is close to the K$\alpha$ x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic deuterium atoms, state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.</description>
