      <title>IKNet: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction via Keyword-Guided Integration of News and Technical Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&amp;P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network Dynamics through Weight Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting state evolution of network systems, such as the spread of information on social networks, is significant for effective policy interventions and resource management. However, the underlying propagation dynamics constantly shift with new topics or events, which are modeled as changing coefficients of the underlying dynamics. Deep learning models struggle to adapt to these out-of-distribution shifts without extensive new data and retraining. To address this, we present Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network Dynamics through Weight Flow Matching (FNFM), a generative, coefficient-conditioned framework that generates dynamic model weights for an unseen target coefficient, enabling zero-shot forecasting. Our framework utilizes a Variational Encoder to summarize the forecaster weights trained in observed environments into compact latent tokens. A Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) module then learns a continuous transport from a simple Gaussian distribution to the empirical distribution of these weights, conditioned on the dynamical coefficients. This process is instantaneous at test time and requires no gradient-based optimization. Across varied dynamical coefficients, empirical results indicate that FNFM yields more reliable zero-shot accuracy than baseline methods, particularly under pronounced coefficient shift.</description>

      <title>Reverse Supply Chain Network Design of a Polyurethane Waste Upcycling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general mathematical programming framework for the design and optimization of supply chain infrastructures for the upcycling of plastic waste. For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply chain network over a specified period. The functionality of the framework has been tested with a case study for the upcycling of rigid polyurethane foam waste coming from construction sites in Germany. The economic potential and infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration. However, with the right economic incentives, there is a considerable potential to establish such value chains, once the upcycling technology is ready and the economic framework conditions have stabilized.</description>

      <title>Poisson Energy Formulation for Floorplanning: Variational Analysis and Mathematical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arranging many modules within a bounded domain without overlap, central to the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) of very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, represents a broad class of discrete geometric optimization problems with physical constraints. This paper develops a variational and spectral framework for Poisson energy-based floorplanning and placement in physical design. We show that the Poisson energy, defined via a Neumann Poisson equation, is exactly the squared H^{-1} Sobolev norm of the density residual, providing a functional-analytic interpretation of the classical electrostatic analogy. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the energy acts as an intrinsic low-pass filter, suppressing high-frequency fluctuations while enforcing large-scale uniformity. Under a mild low-frequency dominance assumption, we establish a quantitative linear lower bound relating the Poisson energy to the geometric overlap area, thereby justifying its use as a smooth surrogate for the hard nonoverlap constraint. We further show that projected gradient descent converges globally to stationary points and exhibits local linear convergence near regular minima. Finally, we interpret the continuous-time dynamics as a Wasserstein-2 gradient flow, revealing the intrinsic nonlocality and global balancing behavior of the model. These results provide a mathematically principled foundation for PDE-regularized optimization in large-scale floorplanning and related geometric layout problems.</description>

      <title>Design of chemical recycling processes for PUR foam under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems in chemical process design involve a significant number of discrete and continuous decisions. When taking into account uncertainties, the search space is very difficult to explore, even for experienced engineers. Moreover, it should be taken into account that while some decisions are fixed at the design stage, other parameters can be adapted to the realization of the uncertainty during the operation of the plant. This leads to a two-stage optimization problem which is difficult to solve. To address this challenge, we propose to combine commercial process simulation software with an evolutionary strategy. This approach is applied to designing a downstream process to isolate valuable products from pyrolysis oil produced by the catalytic pyrolysis of rigid polyurethane foam. The suggested algorithm consistently performed better than a manually designed robust process. Additionally, the analysis of different scenarios provided insight into promising changes in the overall layout of the recycling process.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Value-at-Risk of Loan Portfolio via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio. We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels, compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model, DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Meet Virtual Cell: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent, predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles, for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Unfitted hybrid high-order methods stabilized by polynomial extension for elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the design and analysis of a novel hybrid high-order (HHO) method on unfitted meshes. HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Distributional Semantics Tracing: A Framework for Explaining Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary contributions. First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic failures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context (distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate, contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's ability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation ($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the Transformer architecture.</description>
