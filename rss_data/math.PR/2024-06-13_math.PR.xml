      <title>The Monge-Kantorovich problem on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Monge-Kantorovich problem between two random measuress. More precisely, given probability measures $\mathbb{P}_1,\mathbb{P}_2\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(M))$ on the space $\mathcal{P}(M)$ of probability measures on a smooth compact manifold, we study the optimal transport problem between $\mathbb{P}_1$ and $\mathbb{P}_2 $ where the cost function is given by the squared Wasserstein distance $W_2^2(\mu,\nu)$ between $\mu,\nu \in \mathcal{P}(M)$. Under appropriate assumptions on $\mathbb{P}_1$, we prove that there exists a unique optimal plan and that it takes the form of an optimal map. An extension of this result to cost functions of the form $h(W_2(\mu,\nu))$, for strictly convex and strictly increasing functions $h$, is also established. The proofs rely heavily on a recent result of Schiavo \cite{schiavo2020rademacher}, which establishes a version of Rademacher's theorem on Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Limiting behaviour of Branching Processes and Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature considers multi-type Markov branching processes (BPs), where the offspring distribution depends only on the living (current) population. We analyse the total-current population-dependent BPs where the offspring distribution can also depend on the total (dead and living) population. Such a generalization is inspired by the need to accurately model content propagation over online social networks (OSNs). The key question investigated is the time-asymptotic proportion of the populations, which translates to the proportional visibility of the posts on the OSN. We provide the answer using a stochastic approximation (SA) technique, which has not been used in the existing BP literature. The analysis is derived using a non-trivial autonomous measurable ODE. Interestingly, we prove the possibility of a new limiting behaviour for the stochastic trajectory, named as hovering around. Such a result is not just new to the theory of BPs but also to the SA based literature.
  Later, we explore three new variants of BPs: (i) any living individual of a population can attack and acquire the living individuals of the other population, in addition to producing its offspring; (ii) the individuals can die due to abnormal circumstances, and not just at the completion of their lifetimes; (iii) the expected number of offspring decreases as the total-population increases, leading to the saturation of the total-population.
  Such variants aid in analysing unexplored aspects of content propagation over OSNs: (i) competition in advertisement posts for similar products; (ii) controlling fake-post propagation, while not affecting the sharing of real-post; (iii) impact of re-forwarding the posts. We also designed and analysed a participation (mean-field) game where the OSN lures the users with a reward-based scheme to provide their opinion about the actuality of the post (fake or real).</description>

      <title>Percolation with random one-dimensional reinforcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inhomogeneous Bernoulli bond percolation on the graph $G \times \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a connected quasi-transitive graph. The inhomogeneity is introduced through a random region $R$ around the origin axis $\{0\}\times\mathbb{Z}$, where each edge in $R$ is open with probability $q$ and all other edges are open with probability $p$. When the region $R$ is defined by stacking or overlapping boxes with random radii centered along the origin axis, we derive conditions on the moments of the radii, based on the growth properties of $G$, so that for any subcritical $p$ and any $q&lt;1$, the non-percolative phase persists.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings and Essential Spanning Forests in Hyperbolic Double Circle Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perfect matchings and essential spanning forests in planar hyperbolic graphs.
  Using the double circle packing for a pair of dual graphs, we relate the inverse of the weighted adjacency matrix to the difference of Green's functions plus an explicit harmonic Dirichlet function.
  We prove that the infinite-volume Gibbs measure obtained from approximations by finite domains with exactly two convex white corners converging to two distinct points along the boundary is extremal, yet not invariant with respect to a finite-orbit subgroup of the automorphism group.
  We then prove that the variance of the height difference of two i.i.d.~uniformly weighted perfect matchings under the boundary condition above, or the Temperley boundary condition on a transitive nonamenable planar graph is always finite; in contrast to the 2D uniformly weighted dimer model on a transitive amenable planar graph with Temperley boundary conditions as proved in \cite{RK01,KOS06}, where the variance of height difference grows in the order of $\log n$, with $n$ being the graph distance to the boundary. This also implies that a.s.~each point is surronded by finitely many cycles in the symmetric difference of two i.i.d.~perfect matchings, also in contrast to the 2D Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Gaussian curvature on random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of curvature in the context of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces. We define the Gaussian curvature for LQG, which we conjecture is the scaling limit of discrete curvature on random planar maps. Motivated by this, we study asymptotics for the discrete curvature of $\epsilon$-mated CRT maps. More precisely, we prove that the discrete curvature integrated against a $C_c^2$ test function is of order $\epsilon^{o(1)},$ which is consistent with our scaling limit conjecture. On the other hand, we prove the total discrete curvature on a fixed space-filling SLE segment scaled by $\epsilon^{\frac{1}{4}}$ converges in distribution to an explicit random variable.</description>

      <title>Uniform Large Deviation Principles of Fractional Reaction-Diffusion Equations Driven by Superlinear Multiplicative Noise on R^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform large deviation principle of the fractional stochastic reaction-diffusion equation on the entire space R^n as the noise intensity approaches zero. The nonlinear drift term is dissipative and has a polynomial growth of any order. The nonlinear diffusion term is locally Lipschitz continuous and has a superlinear growth rate. By the weak convergence method, we establish the Freidlin-Wentzell uniform large deviations over bounded initial data as well as the Dembo-Zeitouni uniform large deviations over compact initial data. The main difficulties are caused by the superlinear growth of noise coefficients and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. The dissipativeness of the drift term and the idea of uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are employed to circumvent these difficulties.</description>

Our proof is based on multigraph representations introduced by van Engelenburg-Lis (2023) and a new bijection, which can be viewed as a combinatorial interpretation of Ginibre's square trick.</description>

      <title>On quantum Stochastic Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Master equations or quantum filtering equations for mixed states are well known objects in quantum physics. Building a mathematically rigorous theory of these equations in infinite-dimensional spaces is a long standing open problem. The first objective of this paper is to give a solution to this problem under the assumption of bounded operators providing coupling with environment (or a measurement devise). Furthermore, recently the author built the theory of the law of large number limit for continuously observed interacting quantum particle systems leading to quantum mean-field games. These limits are described by certain nontrivial extensions of quantum stochastic master equations that can be looked at as infinite-dimensional operator-valued McKean-Vlasov diffusions. The second objective of this paper is to provide a well-posedness result for these new class of McKean-Vlasov diffusions.</description>

      <title>On the block size spectrum of the multiplicative Beta coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the (exchangeable, but non-consistent) multiplicative $\Lambda$-coalescent, which accounts for the connected components (blocks) of the dynamic $\Lambda$-random graph. This is the random graph analogue of the classical $\Lambda$-coalescent studied in mathematical population genetics; it is an exchangeable and consistent random graph process. This work considers the case where $\Lambda$ is the beta measure. We prove a dynamic law of large numbers for the numbers of blocks containing $1,...,d$ elements. In addition, we provide a functional limit theorem for the fluctuations around its deterministic trajectory. The limit process satisfies a stochastic differential equation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.</description>

      <title>Thin-thick approach to martingale representations on progressively enlarged filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong predictable representation property in the progressive enlargement F{\tau} of a reference filtration F by a random time {\tau}. Our approach is based on the decomposition of any random time in two parts, one overlapping F-stopping times (thin part) and the other that avoids them (thick part). We assume that the F-thin part of {\tau} is nontrivial and prove in great generality a martingale representation theorem on F{\tau}. The obtained result extends existing results in the literature, where the random time is usually considered equal to its thick part. We illustrate by some examples the case when F is the natural filtration of a L\'evy process.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>From asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries to stationary measures of open KPZ fixed point: the shock region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the investigation of limit fluctuations of stationary measures of the asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries (open ASEP), complementing the recent result by Bryc et al. (2023). It was shown therein that in the fan region of the phase diagram, an appropriate scaling limit of the height function of open ASEP converges in distribution to a stochastic process introduced by Barraquand and Le Doussal (2022), known as the stationary measure of the (conjectural) open KPZ fixed point. In this paper, we establish the corresponding convergence in the shock region. Our proof is based on the integral representation of the matrix product ansatz in terms of Askey-Wilson signed measures introduced by Wang et al. (2023). The analysis of the asymptotic behavior is more delicate here than in the fan region. In particular, our proof of the duality formula for the stationary measures of the open KPZ fixed point in the shock region is different from the approach by Bryc et al. (2023) taken in the fan region: ours relies crucially on a recent result by Bryc and Zatitskii (2024).</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for Bayesian Neural Network trained with Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously derive Central Limit Theorems (CLT) for Bayesian two-layerneural networks in the infinite-width limit and trained by variational inference on a regression task. The different networks are trained via different maximization schemes of the regularized evidence lower bound: (i) the idealized case with exact estimation of a multiple Gaussian integral from the reparametrization trick, (ii) a minibatch scheme using Monte Carlo sampling, commonly known as Bayes-by-Backprop, and (iii) a computationally cheaper algorithm named Minimal VI. The latter was recently introduced by leveraging the information obtained at the level of the mean-field limit. Laws of large numbers are already rigorously proven for the three schemes that admits the same asymptotic limit. By deriving CLT, this work shows that the idealized and Bayes-by-Backprop schemes have similar fluctuation behavior, that is different from the Minimal VI one. Numerical experiments then illustrate that the Minimal VI scheme is still more efficient, in spite of bigger variances, thanks to its important gain in computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a point set in the Euclidean plane that elucidates the relationship between the fine-scale statistics of the fractional parts of $\sqrt n$ and directional statistics for a shifted lattice. We show that the randomly rotated, and then stretched, point set converges in distribution to a lattice-like random point process. This follows closely the arguments in Elkies and McMullen's original analysis for the gap statistics of $\sqrt{n}$ mod 1 in terms of random affine lattices [Duke Math. J. 123 (2004), 95-139]. There is, however, a curious subtlety: the limit process emerging in our construction is NOT invariant under the standard $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>What is the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent? A large deviations analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand which regions of the problem's state space are more likely to be visited by SGD, and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature equal to the method's step-size and energy levels determined by the problem's objective and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions by transport noise of 3D Navier-Stokes equations with small hyperviscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of global smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with hyperviscosity $(-\Delta)^{\gamma}$ is open unless $\gamma $ is close to the J.-L. Lions exponent $ \frac{5}{4}$ at which the energy balance is strong enough to prevent singularity formation. If $1&lt;\gamma \ll \frac{5}{4}$, then the global well-posedness of the hyperviscous NSEs is widely open as for the usual NSEs. In this paper, for all $\gamma&gt;1$, we show the existence of a transport noise for which global smooth solutions to the stochastic hyperviscous NSEs on the three-dimensional torus exist with high probability. In particular, a suitable transport noise considerably improves the known well-posedness results in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \ll 1, $$ where the implied constant is absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a conjecture of Arratia (2002) arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the right-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$. We also use this coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>L\'evy measures on Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an explicit characterisation of L\'evy measures on both $L^p$-spaces and UMD Banach spaces. In the case of $L^p$-spaces, L\'evy measures are characterised by an integrability condition, which directly generalises the known description of L\'evy measures on sequence spaces. The latter has been the only known description of L\'evy measures on infinite dimensional Banach spaces that are not Hilbert. L\'evy measures on UMD Banach spaces are characterised by the finiteness of the expectation of a random {\gamma}-radonifying norm. Although this description is more abstract, it reduces to simple integrability conditions in the case of $L^p$-spaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence and regularity of the isochron map for stable invariant manifolds of a large class of evolution equations. Our results apply in particular to the isochron map of reaction-diffusion equations and neural field equations. Using the regularity properties proven here, we are able to obtain a strong It\^o formula for the isochronal phase of stochastically perturbed travelling waves, spiral waves, and other patterns appearing in SPDEs driven by white noise, even for SPDEs that only admit mild solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the random connection model in which an edge between two Poisson points at distance $r$ is present with probability $g(r)$. We conduct an extreme value analysis on this model, namely by investigating the longest edge with at least one endpoint within some finite observation window, as the volume of this window tends to infinity. We show that the length of the latter, after normalizing by some appropriate centering and scaling sequences, asymptotically behaves like one of each of the three extreme value distributions, depending on choices of the probability $g(r)$. We prove our results by giving a formal construction of the model by means of a marked Poisson point process and a Poisson coupling argument adapted to this construction. In addition, we study a discrete variant of the model. We obtain parameter regimes with varying behavior in our findings and an unexpected singularity.</description>

      <title>Universality of Approximate Message Passing algorithms and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms provide a valuable tool for studying mean-field approximations and dynamics in a variety of applications. Although these algorithms are often first derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or satisfying rotational invariance in law, their state evolution characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of random matrix ensembles.
  We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over delocalized sign-and-permutation-invariant matrix ensembles that have a limit distribution over the diagonal, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators.
  We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the invasion phase for stochastic processes with interactions when a single mutant with positive fitness arrives in a resident population at equilibrium. By a now classic approach, the first stage of the invasion is well approximated by a branching process. The macroscopic phase, when the mutant population is of the same order of the resident population, is described by the limiting dynamical system. We obtain sharper estimates and capture the intermediate mesoscopic phase for the invasive population. It allows us to characterize the hitting times of thresholds, which inherit a large variance from the first stages. These issues are motivated in particular by quantifying times to reach critical values for cancer population or epidemics.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of the convergence of the BHZ renormalized model associated with the generalized (KPZ) equation that does not require the full strength of the BPHZ renormalisation. Our approach is based on a convenient form of chaos decomposition. The other key ingredient is a generalisation of the Hairer-Quastel convergence theorem for Feynman diagrams with certain decorations encoding Taylor remainders. With these ideas we are able to construct the model for the generalised KPZ equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study random walks evolving on Z in a dynamic random environment that we assume to have time correlations that decrease polynomially fast. We show a law of large numbers by generalizing methods already used for the nearest-neighbor framework to the finite-range one. This requires some new ideas to get around the absence of a monotonicity property that was crucial in the proof for the nearest-neighbour case. Our proof works both in discrete and continuous time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the (weak) equilibrium problem arising from the problem of optimally stopping a one-dimensional diffusion subject to an expectation constraint on the time until stopping. The weak equilibrium problem is realized with a set of randomized but purely state dependent stopping times as admissible strategies. We derive a verification theorem and necessary conditions for equilibria, which together basically characterize all equilibria. Furthermore, additional structural properties of equilibria are obtained to feed a possible guess-and-verify approach, which is then illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-continuity of time constant in generalized First-passage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a generalized First-passage percolation model, where each edge in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is independently assigned an infinite weight with probability $1-p$, and a random finite weight otherwise. The existence and positivity of the time constant have been established in [CT16]. Recently, using sophisticated multi-scale renormalizations, Cerf and Dembin [CD22] proved that the time constant of chemical distance in super-critical percolation is Lipschitz continuous. In this work, we propose a different approach leveraging lattice animal theory and a simple one-step renormalization with the aid of Russo's formula, to show the Lipschitz continuity of the time constant in generalized First-passage percolation.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.03122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In network analysis, a measure of node centrality provides a scale indicating how central a node is within a network. The coreness is a popular notion of centrality that accounts for the maximal smallest degree of a subgraph containing a given node. In this paper, we study the coreness of random geometric graphs and show that, with an increasing number of nodes and properly chosen connectivity radius, the coreness converges to a new object, that we call the continuum coreness. In the process, we show that other popular notions of centrality measures, namely the H-index and its iterates, also converge under the same setting to new limiting objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical networks are made of nodes and links that are physical objects embedded in a geometric space. Understanding how the mutual volume exclusion between these elements affects the structure and function of physical networks calls for a suitable generalization of network theory. Here, we introduce a network-of-networks framework where we describe the shape of each extended physical node as a network embedded in space and these networks are bound together by physical links. Relying on this representation, we introduce a minimal model of network growth and we show for a general class of physical networks that volume exclusion induces heterogeneity in both node volume and degree, with the two becoming correlated. These emergent properties strongly affect the dynamics on physical networks: by calculating their Laplacian spectrum as a function of the coupling strength between the nodes we show that degree-volume correlations suppress the role of hubs as early spreaders in diffusive dynamics. We apply the network-of-networks framework to describe several real systems and find properties analog to the minimal model networks. The prevalence of these properties points towards general growth mechanisms that do not depend on the specifics of the systems.</description>

Abstract: Consider a topologically transitive unilateral countable Markov shift $\Sigma$, a locally constant potential $\phi : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying suitable conditions, and assume that $\mu_t$ is the unique stationary Markov equilibrium state associated to the potential $t\phi$ for each $t \geq 1$. In this paper we prove a first level large deviations principle at zero temperature for the family of equilibrium states $(\mu_t)_{t \geq 1}$ and we extend the result to the setting of bilateral countable Markov shifts.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative probability insights into the double-scaling limit SYK Model with constant perturbations: moments cumulants and $q$-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending our previous results, we study the double-scaling limit SYK (DSSYK) model with an additional diagonal matrix with a fixed number $c$ of nonzero constant entries $\theta$. This constant diagonal term can be rewritten in terms of Majorana fermion products. Its specific formula depends on the value of $c$. We find exact expressions for the moments of this model. More importantly, by proposing a moment-cumulant relation, we reinterpret the effect of introducing a constant term in the context of non-commutative probability theory. This gives rise to a $\tilde{q}$ dependent mixture of independences within the moment formula. The parameter $\tilde{q}$, derived from the $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ($q$-OU) process, controls this transformation. It interpolates between classical independence ($\tilde{q}=1$) and Boolean independence ($\tilde{q}=0$). The underlying combinatorial structures of this model provide the non-commutative probability connections. Additionally, we explore the potential relation between these connections and their gravitational path integral counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the infinite-horizon, average-reward restless bandit problem in discrete time. We propose a new class of policies that are designed to drive a progressively larger subset of arms toward the optimal distribution. We show that our policies are asymptotically optimal with an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, provided that the single-armed MDP is unichain and aperiodic under the optimal single-armed policy. Our approach departs from most existing work that focuses on index or priority policies, which rely on the Uniform Global Attractor Property (UGAP) to guarantee convergence to the optimum, or a recently developed simulation-based policy, which requires a Synchronization Assumption (SA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross
