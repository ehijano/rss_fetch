      <title>SCoRES: An R Package for Simultaneous Confidence Region Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of domain sets whose outcomes belong to predefined subsets can address fundamental risk assessment challenges in climatology and medicine. Existing approaches for inverse domain estimates require restrictive assumptions, including domain density and continuity of function near thresholds, and large-sample guarantees, which limit the applicability. Besides, the estimation and coverage depend on setting a fixed threshold level, which is difficult to determine. Recently, Ren et al. (2024) proved that confidence sets of multiple levels can be simultaneously constructed with the desired confidence non-asymptotically through inverting simultaneous confidence bands. Here, we present the SCoRES R package, which implements Ren's approach for both the estimation of the inverse region and the corresponding simultaneous outer and inner confidence regions, along with visualization tools. Besides, the package also provides functions that help construct SCBs for regression data, functional data and geographical data. To illustrate its broad applicability, we present three rigorous examples that demonstrate the SCoRES workflow.</description>

      <title>Bregman geometry-aware split Gibbs sampling for Bayesian Poisson inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian framework for solving Poisson inverse problems by devising a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm which accounts for the underlying non-Euclidean geometry. To address the challenges posed by the Poisson likelihood -- such as non-Lipschitz gradients and positivity constraints -- we derive a Bayesian model which leverages exact and asymptotically exact data augmentations. In particular, the augmented model incorporates two sets of splitting variables both derived through a Bregman divergence based on the Burg entropy. Interestingly the resulting augmented posterior distribution is characterized by conditional distributions which benefit from natural conjugacy properties and preserve the intrinsic geometry of the latent and splitting variables. This allows for efficient sampling via Gibbs steps, which can be performed explicitly for all conditionals, except the one incorporating the regularization potential. For this latter, we resort to a Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo (HRLMC) algorithm which is well suited to handle priors with explicit or easily computable score functions. By operating on a mirror manifold, this Langevin step ensures that the sampling satisfies the positivity constraints and more accurately reflects the underlying problem structure. Performance results obtained on denoising, deblurring, and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments demonstrate that the method achieves competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality compared to optimization- and sampling-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Optimization in Nominally Identical Manufacturing and Measuring Systems for High-Throughput Parallel Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Regression Analysis After Bipartite Bayesian Record Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many settings, a data curator links records from two files to produce datasets that are shared with secondary analysts. Analysts use the linked files to estimate models of interest, such as regressions. Such two-stage approaches do not necessarily account for uncertainty in model parameters that results from uncertainty in the linkages. Further, they do not leverage the relationships among the study variables in the two files to help determine the linkages. We propose a multiple imputation framework to address these shortcomings. First, we use a bipartite Bayesian record linkage model to generate multiple plausible linked datasets, disregarding the information in the study variables. Second, we presume each linked file has a mixture of true links and false links. We estimate the mixture model using information from the study variables. Through simulation studies under a regression setting, we demonstrate that estimates of the regression model parameters can be more accurate than those based on an analogous two-stage approach. We illustrate the integrated approach using data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth, examining a regression involving the persistence of income.</description>

      <title>Transformation-free linear simplicial-simplicial regression via constrained iterative reweighted least squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial-simplicial regression refers to the regression setting where both the responses and predictor variables lie within the simplex space, i.e. they are compositional. \cite{fiksel2022} proposed a transformation-free lienar regression model, that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the observed to the fitted compositions was recently proposed. To effectively estimate the regression coefficients the EM algorithm was employed. We formulate the model as a constrained logistic regression, in the spirit of \cite{tsagris2025}, and we estimate the regression coefficients using constrained iteratively reweighted least squares. This approach makes the estimation procedure significantly faster.</description>

      <title>Shortest fixed-width confidence intervals for a bounded parameter: The Push algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for computing optimal fixed-width confidence intervals for a single, bounded parameter, extending a method for the binomial due to Asparaouhov and Lorden, who called it the Push algorithm. The method produces the shortest possible non-decreasing confidence interval for a given confidence level, and if the Push interval does not exist for a given width and level, then no such interval exists. The method applies to any bounded parameter that is discrete, or is continuous and has the monotone likelihood ratio property. We demonstrate the method on the binomial, hypergeometric, and normal distributions with our available R package. In each of these distributions the proposed method outperforms the standard ones, and in the latter case even improves upon the $z$-interval. We apply the proposed method to World Health Organization (WHO) data on tobacco use.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Multiple-try Metropolis via Poincar\'e inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm using the framework of Poincar\'e inequalities. We describe the Multiple-try Metropolis as an auxiliary variable implementation of a resampling approximation to an ideal Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. Under suitable moment conditions on the importance weights, we derive explicit Poincar\'e comparison results between the Multiple-try algorithm and the ideal algorithm. We characterize the spectral gap of the latter, and finally in the Gaussian case prove explicit non-asymptotic convergence bounds for Multiple-try Metropolis by comparison.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solvers for SLOPE in R, Python, Julia, and C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a suite of packages in R, Python, Julia, and C++ that efficiently solve the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) problem. The packages feature a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent algorithm that fits generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports a variety of loss functions, including Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial logistic regression. Our implementation is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and flexible. The packages support a variety of data structures (dense, sparse, and out-of-memory matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE path as well as handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the relaxed SLOPE. We present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks that demonstrate the performance of the packages on both real and simulated data and show that our packages outperform existing implementations of SLOPE in terms of speed.</description>

      <title>On the contraction properties of Sinkhorn semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel semigroup stability analysis based on Lyapunov techniques and contraction coefficients to prove exponential convergence of Sinkhorn equations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields exponential decays of Sinkhorn iterates towards Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to general classes of $\phi$-divergences and Kantorovich-type criteria, including the relative entropy, squared Hellinger integrals, $\alpha$-divergences as well as weighted total variation norms and Wasserstein distances. To the best of our knowledge, these contraction inequalities are the first results of this type in the literature on entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm.
  We also provide Lyapunov contractions principles under minimal regularity conditions that allow to provide quantitative exponential stability estimates for a large class of Sinkhorn semigroups. We apply this novel framework in a variety of situations, ranging from polynomial growth potentials and heavy tailed marginals on general normed spaces to more sophisticated boundary state space models, including semi-circle transitions, Beta, Weibull, exponential marginals as well as semi-compact models. Last but not least, our approach also allows to consider statistical finite mixture of the above models, including kernel-type density estimators of complex data distributions arising in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method to equip data-driven polynomial chaos expansion surrogate models with intervals that quantify the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate. To that end, jackknife-based conformal prediction is integrated into regression-based polynomial chaos expansions. The jackknife algorithm uses leave-one-out residuals to generate predictive intervals around the predictions of the polynomial chaos surrogate. The jackknife+ extension additionally requires leave-one-out model predictions. Both methods allow to use the entire dataset for model training and do not require a hold-out dataset for prediction interval calibration. The key to efficient implementation is to leverage the linearity of the polynomial chaos regression model, so that leave-one-out residuals and, if necessary, leave-one-out model predictions can be computed with analytical, closed-form expressions. This eliminates the need for repeated model re-training. The conformalized polynomial chaos expansion method is first validated on four benchmark models and then applied to two electrical engineering design use-cases. The method produces predictive intervals that provide the target coverages, even for low-accuracy models trained with small datasets. At the same time, training data availability plays a crucial role in improving the empirical coverage and narrowing the predictive interval, as well as in reducing their variability over different training datasets.</description>

      <title>Is Representational Similarity Analysis Reliable? A Comparison with Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is a popular method for analyzing neuroimaging and behavioral data. Here we evaluate the accuracy and reliability of RSA in the context of model selection, and compare it to that of regression. Although RSA offers flexibility in handling high-dimensional, cross-modal, and cross-species data, its reliance on a transformation of raw data into similarity structures may result in the loss of critical stimulus-response information. Across extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses, we show that RSA leads to lower model selection accuracy, regardless of sample size, noise level, feature dimensionality, or multicollinearity, relative to regression. While principal component analysis and feature reweighting mitigate RSA's deficits driven by multicollinearity, regression remains superior in accurately distinguishing between models. Empirical data and a follow-up fMRI simulation further support these conclusions. Our findings suggest that researchers should carefully consider which approach to use: RSA is less effective than linear regression for model selection and fitting when direct stimulus-response mappings are available.</description>

      <title>From Path Coefficients to Targeted Estimands: A Comparison of Structural Equation Models (SEM) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has gained popularity in the social sciences and causal inference due to its flexibility in modeling complex relationships between variables and its availability in modern statistical software. To move beyond the parametric assumptions of SEM, this paper reviews targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), a doubly robust, machine learning-based approach that builds on nonparametric SEM. We demonstrate that both TMLE and SEM can be used to estimate standard causal effects and show that TMLE is robust to model misspecification. We conducted simulation studies under both correct and misspecified model conditions, implementing SEM and TMLE to estimate these causal effects. The simulations confirm that TMLE consistently outperforms SEM under misspecification in terms of bias, mean squared error, and the validity of confidence intervals. We applied both approaches to a real-world dataset to analyze the mediation effects of poverty on access to high school, revealing that the direct effect is no longer significant under TMLE, whereas SEM indicates significance. We conclude with practical guidance on using SEM and TMLE in light of recent developments in targeted learning for causal inference.</description>
