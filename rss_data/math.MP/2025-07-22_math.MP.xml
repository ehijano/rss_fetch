      <title>Random marked nested tessellations applied to the modelling of deformation twinning in polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic geometry provides a powerful framework for modelling complex random structures, with applications in physics, materials science, biology, and other fields. The three-dimensional microstructure of polycrystalline materials is usually modeled by a randomly marked tessellation, where the marks correspond to crystallographic orientations. The purpose of this study is to extend the modelling approach to a finer scale, focusing on the subcells that emerge when a material specimen is exposed to mechanical loading. Specifically, the deformation twinning gives rise to nested tessellation, where the subcells are parallel twin lamellae and their complement is embedded within the original mother cells. The aim of this study is to develop a parametric mathematical model of marked nested tessellation and to realize it using stochastic simulations. We were able to deal with this model using computational tools. The sensitivity of the model to selected key parameters was investigated using statistical methods. As an application, a numerical simulation of the stress and strain fields resulting from deformation twinning is provided, and the contribution of the subcells to the total strain energy density under varying initial conditions was evaluated. This study highlights the dynamic capabilities of stochastic geometry in modelling a phenomenon that changes the microstructure.</description>

      <title>On the Cowling Approximation: A Verification of Ansatz via Methods of Functional and Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cowling approximation by analytical means as applied to a system of linear differential equations arising from models of non-radial stellar pulsation. We consider various asymptotic cases, including those of high harmonic degree and high oscillation frequency. Our methods involve a reformulation of the system in terms of an integro-differential equation for which certain Hilbert-space methods apply. By way of a more complete asymptotic study, we extend our results to certain fundamental solution sets, characterized according to certain multi-point boundary-value problems: Such asymptotics further enable us to produce sharp estimates as confirmation of our general results.</description>

      <title>The Dirac oscillator, generalised parastatistics and colour Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirac oscillator in one, two and three spatial dimensions, showing that the corresponding ladder operators realise the $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded Lie superalgebras $ \mathfrak{pso}(3|2) $, $ \mathfrak{pso}(3|4) $ and $ \mathfrak{osp}_{01}(1|2) \oplus \mathfrak{sl}_{10}(1|1)$. These algebraic structures are related to parastatistics and their Fock spaces. We demonstrate that these colour algebras and Fock spaces are useful for analysing the Dirac oscillator and its eigenspaces, particularly in $ (1+3) $-dimensions. Apart from this current work, to our knowledge, the recent article by Ito and Nago (arXiv:2501.07311) is the only other such work that makes use of $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2 $ graded colour Lie superalgebras in a relativistic setting.</description>

      <title>Differential constraints for hyperbolic systems through k-Riemann invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a reduction procedure for determining exact wave solutions of first order quasilinear hyperbolic one-dimensional nonhomogeneous systems. The approach is formulated within the theoretical framework of the method of differential constraints and it makes use of the $k-$Riemann invariants. The solutions obtained permit to characterize rarefaction waves also for nonhomogeneous models so that Riemann problems can be solved. Applications to the Euler system describing an ideal fluid with a source term are given.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcations of resonances in ring's dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use perturbation theory and bifurcation theory to analyze the dynamical behavior of resonances, associated to a model describing a particle moving within a ring around a celestial object. The central body is modeled as a homogeneous triaxial ellipsoid, rotating about its shortest physical axis at a constant angular velocity. It is assumed that the massless ring particle moves within the equatorial plane of the ellipsoid. The dynamics of the particle is studied using epicyclic variables, that lead to a straightforward definition of corotation and Lindblad resonances. These resonances are associated to a Hamiltonian function with two degrees of freedom, for which we compute appropriate expansions for the normal form and the resonant Hamiltonian. Initially, the normal form is verified to be non--degenerate, thereby guaranteeing the existence of invariant KAM tori, providing the stability of the resonances, through their confinement in phase space. Subsequently, two exemplary test cases are examined: a nearly spherical ellipsoid and a highly aspherical ellipsoid. Furthermore, this study concentrates on three principal resonances: corotation, 1:2, and 1:3, for which we present results concerning their dynamical behavior obtained analyzing the Hamiltonian formulation of the model and the resonant normal form. Specifically, we examine the phase space structure, the amplitude of libration around the resonances, and the occurrence of bifurcations. Remarkably, in none of the two studied test cases the 1:3 resonance presents evidence of bifurcations for relevant values of the eccentricity. Our dynamical study thus supports a greater probability of selecting the $1:3$ resonance in comparison to the other resonances.</description>

      <title>On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</description>

      <title>Sharp Square Root Bounds for Edge Eigenvector Universality in Sparse Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eigenvectors of random regular graphs behave when projected onto fixed directions. For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the degree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow approximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen bound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\sqrt{d} \cdot N^{-1/6+\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly improves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we prove our $\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities that exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a vector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and (3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control higher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for eigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Seven Sphere Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-oriented contact manifolds quite generally describe classical dynamical systems. Quantization is achieved by suitably associating a Schr\"odinger equation to every path in the contact manifold. We quantize the standard contact seven sphere by treating it as a homogeneous space of the quaternionic unitary group in order to construct a contact analog of Fedosov's formal connection on symplectic spinor bundles. We show that requiring convergence of the formal connection naturally filters the symplectic spinor bundle and yields an exact flat connection on each corresponding subbundle. A key ingredient is a generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff mechanism to the quaternionic unitary group. The passage from formal to bona fide quantization determines unitary irreducible representations of the quaternionic unitary group, whose dimensions tend to infinity as the formal deformation parameter approaches its classical limit. This appearance of finite-dimensional representations is not surprising since the contact seven sphere is closed and physically describes generalized positions, momenta and time variables.</description>

      <title>On the direct and inverse electromagnetic scattering in a parallel-plate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper devotes to providing rigorous theoretical analysis of the wellposedness of the direct problem and the uniqueness of the inverse problem of electromagnetic scattering in a parallel-plate waveguide. The direct problem is reduced to an equivalent boundary value problem on a bounded domain by introducing an exact transparent boundary condition in terms of the electric-to-magnetic Calder\'on operator which can be explicitly represented as a series expansion. Then the wellopsedness of the reduced problem in appropriate Sobolev spaces is proved via the variational approach provided by some necessary properties of the Calder\'on operator and Helmholtz decomposition. Relying on the Green's representation formula and a reciprocity relation, the probe method, finally, is utilized to show the uniqueness of the inverse obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Triplet Interactions: Areal and Perimetric Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are Hamiltonian systems with forces between pairs of particles. We propose an alternative: Hamiltonian dynamics with triplet interactions between point particles. Our system has a potential energy that depends on the shape of the triangle for each triplet. Similar multi-body forces occur in many physical systems, e.g., polarizable molecules, nucleon interactions, and colloids, but typically are combined with more conventional two-body forces. We focus on potentials that depend only on the triangle perimeter or on its area. The resulting forces point towards a center of the triangle, either the incenter or the orthocenter, respectively. For the planar case, the resulting system has six degrees of freedom but can be reduced to three since it conserves the total momentum and angular momentum. The dynamics often exhibits chaotic motion, but there are a number of special solutions, for example equilateral and isosceles triangles, and perturbations of these can lie on invariant tori. Numerical investigations of several examples show families of such regular trajectories as well as examples of chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized System with Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-time blowup of solutions $(u(x,t),b(x,t))$ to a generalized system of equations with applications to ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and one-dimensional fluid convection and stretching, among other areas, is investigated. The system is parameter-dependent, our spatial domain is the unit interval or the circle, and the initial data $(u_0(x),b_0(x))$ is assumed to be smooth. Among other results, we derive precise blowup criteria for specific values of the parameters by tracking the evolution of $u_x$ along Lagrangian trajectories that originate at a point $x_0$ at which $b_0(x)$ and $b_0'(x)$ vanish. We employ concavity arguments, energy estimates, and ODE comparison methods. We also show that for some values of the parameters, a non-vanishing $b_0'(x_0)$ suppresses finite-time blowup.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning-Based Prediction: A Polynomial Chaos Expansion Approach for Joint Model and Input Uncertainty Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) surrogate models are increasingly used in engineering analysis and design to replace computationally expensive simulation models, significantly reducing computational cost and accelerating decision-making processes. However, ML predictions contain inherent errors, often estimated as model uncertainty, which is coupled with variability in model inputs. Accurately quantifying and propagating these combined uncertainties is essential for generating reliable engineering predictions. This paper presents a robust framework based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) to handle joint input and model uncertainty propagation. While the approach applies broadly to general ML surrogates, we focus on Gaussian Process regression models, which provide explicit predictive distributions for model uncertainty. By transforming all random inputs into a unified standard space, a PCE surrogate model is constructed, allowing efficient and accurate calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the output. The proposed methodology also offers a mechanism for global sensitivity analysis, enabling the accurate quantification of the individual contributions of input variables and ML model uncertainty to the overall output variability. This approach provides a computationally efficient and interpretable framework for comprehensive uncertainty quantification, supporting trustworthy ML predictions in downstream engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Wigner quasi-probability distribution for symmetric multi-quDit systems and their generalized heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a symmetric $N$-quDit system described by a density matrix $\rho$, we construct a one-parameter $s$ family $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ of quasi-probability distributions through generalized Fano multipole operators and Stratonovich-Weyl kernels. The corresponding phase space is the complex projective ${C}P^{D-1}=U(D)/U(D-1)\times U(1)$, related to fully symmetric irreducible representations of the unitary group $U(D)$. For the particular cases $D=2$ (qubits) and $D=3$ (qutrits), we analyze the phase-space structure of Schr\"odinger $U(D)$-spin cat (parity adapted coherent) states and we provide plots of the corresponding Wigner $\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\rho$ function. We examine the connection between non-classical behavior and the negativity of the Wigner function. We also compute the generalized heat kernel relating two quasi-probability distributions $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ and $\mathcal{F}^{(s')}_\rho$, with $t=(s'-s)/2$ playing the role of ``time'', together with their twisted Moyal product in terms of a trikernel. In the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$, we recover the usual Gaussian smoothing for $s'&gt;s$. A diagramatic interpretation of the phase-space construction in terms of Young tableaux is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vanishing elasticity limit for minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes model with finite energy. By adopting a refined blow-up and covering analysis, we establish the optimal $ L^p $ ($ 1&lt;p&lt;\infty $) convergence of minimizers and achieve the sharp $ L^1 $ convergence rate of the bulk energy term.</description>

      <title>Wall Wettability Control of Cavitation Patterns and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of wall wettability, characterized by the wall contact angle (WCA), in controlling cavitation dynamics and stability around a Clark Y hydrofoil. High-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES) coupled with a dynamic contact angle model were employed within the OpenFOAM framework to explore WCAs ranging from hydrophilic ($0^\circ$) to superhydrophobic ($160^\circ$) under distinct cavitation numbers ($\sigma = 1.6$, $0.8$, and $0.4$), representing incipient, cloud, and supercavitation regimes, respectively. The results show that increasing WCA consistently promotes earlier cavitation inception, thicker cavity development, and greater flow unsteadiness. For $\sigma = 1.6$, higher WCAs led to smaller, detached vapor bubbles and localized pressure fluctuations. At $\sigma = 0.8$, superhydrophobic surfaces caused more extensive vapor structures, intensified shedding dynamics, and stronger pressure fluctuations. For $\sigma = 0.4$, high WCAs facilitated stable, wall-adhered cavities that suppressed re-entrant jet activity and reduced unsteady loading. These findings demonstrate that surface wettability serves as an effective passive control mechanism for tailoring cavitation behavior and optimizing flow stability in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited-state energies with analytic errors and short time evolution on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function, avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems. By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between toric Ricci-flat metrics in dimension 4 and axisymmetric harmonic maps from the 3-dimensional Euclidean space into the hyperbolic plane. Applications include
  (1). The construction of complete Ricci-flat 4-manifolds that are non-spin, simply-connected, and with arbitrary second Betti number. Our method is non-perturbative and is based on ruling out conical singularities arising from axisymmetric harmonic maps. These metrics also give systematic counterexamples to various versions of the Riemannian black hole uniqueness conjecture.
  (2). A PDE classification result for axisymmetric harmonic maps of degree at most 1, via the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz and the LeBrun-Tod ansatz, in terms of axisymmetric harmonic functions. This is motivated by the study of hyperkahler and conformally Kahler gravitational instantons.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a discrete half-line $m \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) located at $m=0$, with distribution $Q(u_j)$. By computing the first two moments, $\la G_N \ra$ and $\la G_N^2 \ra$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over the disorder, we show that the pinning transition for $\la G_N^2 \ra$ may or may not coincide with that of $\la G_N \ra$, depending on the details of the disorder distribution $Q(u_j)$. This result reconciles opposite viewpoints on whether the pinning transition points in models with annealed and quenched disorder coincide or not.</description>

Abstract: We study the Trotter approximation for a pair of orbital angular momentum operators, $L_x$ and $L_y$. In particular, we investigate the scaling behavior of the state-dependent Trotter error. We show that for states in the domains of the orbital angular momentum operators the Trotter error scales as $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the time discretization. Instead, the convergence rate can be arbitrarily slow for states that do not belong to the domains of all three angular momentum operators simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Closed Categorical Enumerative Invariants: Circle-Action Formality Morphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical enumerative invariants of a Calabi-Yau category, encoded as the partition function of the associated closed string field theory (SFT), conjecturally equal Gromov-Witten invariants when applied to Fukaya categories. Part of this theory is a formality $L_\infty$ morphism which depends on a splitting of the non-commutative Hodge filtration. Our main result is providing an open-closed formality morphism; the algebraic structures involved conjecturallygive a home to open-closed GW invariants. We explain how the open-closed morphism is an ingredient towards quantizing the large $N$ open SFT of an object of a Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles through the lens of five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in $\Omega$-background. We extend the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theoretical construction of key geometric and representation-theoretic structures, established in earlier works, to the five-dimensional uplift. We construct and analyze the $Q$-operators and $q$-opers associated with the canonical codimension-two defect: the $Q$-operators are defined via the insertion of the defect, while the $q$-opers arise as the $q$-difference chiral ring equations in its presence. The $q$-oper difference equations are further identified with the Baxter TQ equations for XXZ spin chains constructed from tensor products of bi-infinite evaluation modules over quantum affine algebras of type ${\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$. We define a $q$-difference module structure on the space of monodromy codimension-two defect partition functions and show that the eigenstates of the $Q$-operators, constructed from monodromy defects, simultaneously diagonalize the quantum Hamiltonians of the XXZ spin chain. A Fourier transformation exchanges the $Q$-operators associated with two XXZ spin chains bispectral dual to each other. Finally, we relate these constructions to the quantum cluster algebra arising from the BPS quiver of the 5d theory, and re-express the R-matrices in terms of the cluster variables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I focus on the scalar one-point functions in SO(6) sector of D5-D3 probe-brane set-up. Start with a general introduction of integrability, I explore both coordinate Bethe ansatz and algebraic Bethe ansatz, with possible generalization. I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

Abstract: The Yajima-Oikawa equation is a deformation of the Zakharov equation which models the propagation of ion sound waves subject to the ponderomotive force induced by high-frequency Langmuir waves. In this work, we study the exact soliton solutions and long-time asymptotics of the Yajima-Oikawa equation by Riemann-Hilbert approach. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated in terms of two reflection coefficients determined by the initial condition. Then exact soliton solutions associated with the Yajima-Oikawa equation are obtained based on this Riemann-Hilbert problem. Finally, the long-time asymptotics of solution to the Yajima-Oikawa equation in Zakharov-Manakov region is formulated by Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method.</description>

      <title>Using stochastic thermodynamics with internal variables to capture orientational spreading in cell populations undergoing cyclic stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi: Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter, P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to test this modeling framework.</description>

      <title>Meson mass spectrum in Ising Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-particle approximation of the Ising Field Theory (IFT), formulated in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Derived by Fonseca and Zamolodchikov as a systematic realization of the McCoy-Wu approach, this equation captures confinement by modeling ``mesons'' as bound states of two Majorana fermions (``quarks''), in a way analogous to the integral equation in the 't Hooft model. Despite its approximate nature, the BS equation provides remarkably accurate predictions for the mass spectrum of stable mesons across a wide range of parameters. Motivated by the striking structural similarity between the BS equation in IFT and the 't Hooft equation in two-dimensional QCD, we develop a new non-perturbative analytical framework inspired by the method of Fateev, Lukyanov, and Zamolodchikov (FLZ). Within this approach, we compute spectral sums and systematically derive the large-$n$ WKB expansion for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which governs the spectrum of an infinite tower of mesons. We further examine how our analytical results capture the known behavior of the spectrum in well-studied asymptotic regimes, such as the $E_8$ limit and the free-fermion point, where exact solutions are available for comparison. Finally, we discuss how the obtained spectral data admit a natural analytic continuation to complex values of the parameters -- an extension that was one of the primary motivations for this work.</description>

      <title>New Partial Trace Inequalities and Distillability of Werner States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05726v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study if there exists a state with negative partial transpose which is undistillable. This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities, this is the aim of our first main result. As a consequence we obtain a new bound for the $2$-distillability of Werner states, which does not depend on the dimension of the system. On the other hand, our second main result provides new partial trace inequalities for bipartite systems, connecting some of them also with the separability of Werner states. Throughout this work we also present numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.</description>

      <title>An elliptic fibration arising from the Lagrange top and its monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is to investigate an elliptic fibration over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ arising from the Lagrange top from the viewpoint of complex algebraic geometry. The description of the discriminant locus of this elliptic fibration is given in detail. Moreover, the concrete description of the discriminant locus and the complete classification of singular fibres of the elliptic fibration are obtained according to Miranda's theory of elliptic threefolds after suitable modifications of the base and total spaces. Furthermore, the monodromy of the elliptic fibration is described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in strongly disordered, interacting, quantum chains, the conductance of a chain of length $L$ vanishes faster than $1/L$. This means that transport is anomalous in such chains. This phenomenon was first claimed in \cite{Basko2006,gornyi2005interacting} and a pioneering treatment appeared in \cite{Imbrie2016a}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05881v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-range one-dimensional Riesz gas on the circle, a continuous system of particles interacting through a Riesz kernel. We establish near-optimal rigidity estimates on gaps valid at any scale. Leveraging these local laws together with Stein's method, we prove a quantitative Central Limit Theorem for linear statistics. The proof is based on a mean-field transport and a fine analysis of the fluctuations of local error terms using various convexity and monotonicity arguments. Using a comparison principle for the Helffer-Sj\"ostrand equation, the method can handle very singular test functions, including characteristic functions of intervals.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Virasoro representations in Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the analytic continuation of Liouville eigenstates and shows that they assemble into irreducible highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, for all values of the conformal weights. This builds on previous results from the first author and Guillarmou, Kupiainen, Rhodes &amp; Vargas, where such representations were constructed except for the conformal weight on the Kac table. In order to extend these results to the degenerate weights, we find explicit analytic expressions for the Virasoro descendants and uncover the probabilistic meaning of the Kac table.
  In the algebraic approach to conformal field theory, the irreducibility is a crucial property that must be satisfied by the representations in the spectrum, and is usually taken as an axiom. Computationally, it leads to the celebrated null-vector (or BPZ) equations for correlation functions and conformal blocks, which are the cornerstone of the integrability of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

      <title>Isochronous waveforms of Li\'enard equations via commutative factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isochronous waveform solutions of homogeneous Li\'enard equations are obtained by a modification of the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-P\'erez.
  The scheme is based on the assumption that the intermediate function $\Phi$ that can be introduced in this factorization method depends on both
  the dependent and independent variables of the nonlinear equation. The method is applied to three cases, a noted cubic anharmonic oscillator, a Li\'enard-reduced form of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver evolution equation, and the cubic-quintic Wilson's Li\'enard equation. All these cases are written in a commutative factored form that allows to obtain the general solutions as solutions of a certain type of Bernoulli differential equation. A theorem is also given asserting the general form of the Li\'enard equation, i.e., for given polynomial degree n of its coefficients, which can be solved by this method. The conditions under which these equations can be also approached by non-local transformations are established.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Reductibility Experiments of RANS-Inspired Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior to any statistical averaging we derive a rotational form of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, eliminating the pressure and exposing a velocity--vorticity interplay governed by \[ \partial_t(\boldsymbol{\omega}+\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}})
  +(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\omega}
  +(\mathbf{\tilde{v}}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}
  +(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}
  +(\mathbf{\tilde{v}}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\omega}
  -\nu\Delta(\boldsymbol{\omega}+\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}})=\mathbf{0}. \] All terms are differential polynomials; hence the system generates a differential--algebraic ideal. Using the Rosenfeld--Groebner algorithm we obtain an equivalent triangular hierarchy whose first equation involves a single variable, the second at most two, and so on. This decoupling clarifies how prescribed mean-flow data drive the turbulent fluctuations and provides a hierarchy-ready foundation for physics-informed or physics-embedded neural networks. Energy estimates in Sobolev spaces complement the algebraic reduction and establish local well-posedness when the initial kinetic energy of the velocity and its curl is finite. The joint algebraic--energetic framework thus offers a pressure-free, computationally economical platform for data-driven turbulence analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of grokking -- delayed generalization accompanied by non-monotonic test loss behavior -- in a simple binary logistic classification task, for which "memorizing" and "generalizing" solutions can be strictly defined. Surprisingly, we find that grokking arises naturally even in this minimal model when the parameters of the problem are close to a critical point, and provide both empirical and analytical insights into its mechanism. Concretely, by appealing to the implicit bias of gradient descent, we show that logistic regression can exhibit grokking when the training dataset is nearly linearly separable from the origin and there is strong noise in the perpendicular directions. The underlying reason is that near the critical point, "flat" directions in the loss landscape with nearly zero gradient cause training dynamics to linger for arbitrarily long times near quasi-stable solutions before eventually reaching the global minimum. Finally, we highlight similarities between our findings and the recent literature, strengthening the conjecture that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Graded supermanifolds and homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold which is, roughly speaking, a supermanifold equipped with a privileged atlas whose coordinates have certain (real) homogeneity degrees. This defines a sheaf of graded algebras on the supermanifold, which is an additional structure on the supermanifold. The main principle of this approach is that grading is ultimately related to homogeneity. But assigning consistently homogeneity degrees to coordinates is the same as fixing a certain global vector field, the weight vector field. This approach is simple and more general than most of the approaches to graded manifolds present in the literature. In particular, the homogeneity degrees can be arbitrary reals, and the corresponding category includes compact supermanifolds. We systematically study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroup, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, and other related concepts like double homogeneity. The main achievements in this framework are proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma and a homogeneous analog of the Darboux Theorem, which seem to be interesting even for purely even homogeneity manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \cong M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like' time'. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston and violates the cosmological principle. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic indistinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (CAT maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus (and on its dual space). Finally, we study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT maps from the viewpoint of the Koopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of robust entanglement generation in engineered XX spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols in finite XX spin chains with varying spin magnitudes ($s = 1/2, 1, 3/2 $). Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. At the same time, Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. These advantages stem from its ability to suppress the bulk population and minimize susceptibility to decoherence. Together, the scalability, efficiency, and noise resilience of the dual-port approach position it as a promising framework for entanglement distribution in solid-state quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>On the original Ulam's problem and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>A Lax representation and integrability of homogeneous exact magnetic flows on spheres in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. We provide a Lax representation of the equations of motion and prove complete integrability of those systems for any $n$. The integrability is provided via first integrals of degree one and two.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles II: Sigma Models on Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Integral Invariants and Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review and methodological article we discuss the main ideas of the integral invariants theory. This theory was originated by Poincare and Cartan. We show how ideas of this theory connect such different fields of mathematical physics as Hamiltonian dynamics, optics and hydrodynamics. We focus our attention on the results that are rarely expounded in the literature.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants so that it reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>
