      <title>On best constrained and best simultaneous approximation in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is folklore that the sum of two $M$-ideals (semi $M$-ideals) is also an $M$-ideal (a semi $M$-ideal). Numerous authors have attempted to investigate such properties of subspaces. This article explores two important facets of approximation theory within Banach spaces and how these properties remain intact when considering the sum of two subsets. Recall the notion of $(GC)$ introduced by Vesel\'y that encloses two aforementioned properties. When the sum of two subspaces is closed, we discuss various properties of the sum if one of the subspaces has these properties. Counterexamples are produced that establish nonaffirmativeness for the properties $(GC)$ and the central subspace. We answer a problem raised by the author in [{\em Best constrained approximation in Banach spaces}, Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim. {\bf 36}(2) (2015), 248--255]. We extend our observations related to the best simultaneous approximations to the properties $(P_1)$ and $\mr{F}$-SACP.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Constrained Quantization for Compactly Supported Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the asymptotics of high-rate constrained quantization errors for a compactly supported probability measure P on Euclidean spaces whose quantizers are confined to a closed set S. The key tool is the metric projection of K onto S that assigns each source point to its nearest neighbor in S, allowing the errors to be transferred to the projection, where K = supp P. For the upper estimate, we establish a projection pull-back inequality that bounds the errors by the classical covering radius of the projection. For the lower estimate, a weighted distance function enables us to perturb any quantizer element lying on the projection slightly into the complement in S without enlarging the error, provided the projection is nowhere dense (automatically true when S and K are disjoint). Under mild conditions on the pushforward measure of P by T, obtained via a measurable selector T, we derive a uniform lower bound. If this set is Ahlfors regular of dimension d, the error decays like the reciprocal of the d-th root of n and every constrained quantization dimension equals d. The two estimates coincide, giving the first complete dimension comparison formula for constrained quantization and closing the gap left by earlier self-similar examples by Pandey-Roychowdhury while extending classical unconstrained theory to closed constraints under mild geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>New Tight Wavelet Frame Constructions Sharing Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tight wavelet frames (TWFs) in \(L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)\) are versatile, and are practically useful due to their perfect reconstruction property. Nevertheless, existing TWF construction methods exhibit limitations, including a lack of specific methods for generating mother wavelets in extension-based construction, and the necessity to address the sum of squares (SOS) problem even when specific methods for generating mother wavelets are provided in SOS-based construction. Many TWF constructions begin with a given refinable function. However, this approach places the entire burden on finding suitable mother wavelets. In this paper, we introduce TWF construction methods that spread the burden between both types of functions: refinable functions and mother wavelets. These construction methods offer an alternative approach to addressing the SOS problem. We present examples to illustrate our construction methods.</description>

      <title>Topology of irrationally indifferent attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:1706.02678v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the post-critical set of a class of holomorphic systems with an irrationally indifferent fixed point. We prove a trichotomy for the topology of the post-critical set based on the arithmetic of the rotation number at the fixed point. The only options are Jordan curves, a one-sided hairy Jordan curves, and Cantor bouquet. This explains the degeneration of the closed invariant curves inside the Siegel disks, as one varies the rotation number.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>Extremizer Stability of Higher-order Hardy-Rellich inequalities for Baouendi--Grushin vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the $L^p$-Rellich and Hardy-Rellich inequalities in the setting of radial Baouendi-Grushin vector fields. We establish an identity relating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating their equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities via an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive Hardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin framework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the $L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing identities rather than inequalities.</description>
