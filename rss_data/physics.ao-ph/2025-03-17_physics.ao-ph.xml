      <title>The latest monthly highs suggest that the 1.5{\deg}C Paris Agreement threshold will probably be exceeded before 2028</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attempt is made to estimate and forecast the trend of the global annual and monthly mean temperatures. The results of a conventional statistical analysis suggest that in the absence of unforeseeable events such as a sudden acceleration in the rate of warming, the 1.5{\deg}C Paris Agreement threshold could be exceeded between 2027 and 2031. However, carrying out a proper seasonal adjustment and examining the autocorrelation structure carefully, we find in a subsequent purely statistical simulation study that even the pessimistic scenario of a breach in late 2027 is inconsistent with the recent monthly highs, which means that it will probably happen much sooner.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and improving wave and non-wave stress parametrisations for oceanic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whenever oceanic currents flow over rough topography, there is an associated stress that acts to modify the flow. In the deep ocean, this stress is predominantly form drag, caused by the formation of internal waves and other baroclinic motions: processes that act on such small scales most global ocean models cannot resolve. Despite the need to incorporate this stress into ocean models, existing parametrisations are limited in their applicability. For instance, most parametrisations are only suitable for small-scale topography and are either for periodic or steady flows, but rarely a combination thereof. Here we summarise these existing parametrisations and evaluate their accuracy using hundreds of idealised two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations spanning a wide parameter space. In cases where the parametrisations prove to be in inaccurate, we use our data to suggest improved formulations. Our results thus provide a basis for a comprehensive parameterisation of stress in ocean models where fine scale topography is unresolved.</description>

      <title>Development of a Data-driven weather forecasting system over India with Pangu-Weather architecture and IMDAA reanalysis Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) has advanced significantly in recent decades but still faces challenges in accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. Data-driven weather models have shown great promise, sometimes surpassing operational NWP systems. However, training these models on massive datasets incurs high computational costs. A regional data-driven approach offers a cost-effective alternative for localized forecasts. This study develops a regional weather forecasting model for India by efficiently modifying the Pangu-Weather (PW) architecture. The model is trained using the Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) reanalysis dataset with limited computational resources. Prediction results are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Fractional Skill Score (FSS). At a 6-hour lead time, MAPE remains below 5%, FSS exceeds 0.86, and ACC stays above 0.94, demonstrating robustness. Three forecasting approaches, static, autoregressive, and hierarchical, are compared. Errors increase with lead time in all cases. The static approach exhibits periodic fluctuations in error metrics, which are absent in the autoregressive method. The hierarchical approach also shows fluctuations, though with reduced intensity after three days. Among these, the hierarchical approach performs best while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, the model effectively predicts cyclone tracks using the hierarchical approach, achieving results comparable to observational and reanalysis datasets.</description>

      <title>RainScaleGAN: a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Rainfall Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To this day, accurately simulating local-scale precipitation and reliably reproducing its distribution remains a challenging task. The limited horizontal resolution of Global Climate Models is among the primary factors undermining their skill in this context. The physical mechanisms driving the onset and development of precipitation, especially in extreme events, operate at spatio-temporal scales smaller than those numerically resolved, thus struggling to be captured accurately. In order to circumvent this limitation, several downscaling approaches have been developed over the last decades to address the discrepancy between the spatial resolution of models output and the resolution required by local-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce RainScaleGAN, a conditional deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for precipitation downscaling. GANs have been effectively used in image super-resolution, an approach highly relevant for downscaling tasks. RainScaleGAN's capabilities are tested in a perfect-model setup, where the spatial resolution of a precipitation dataset is artificially degraded from 0.25$^{\circ}\times$0.25$^{\circ}$ to 2$^{\circ}\times$2$^\circ$, and RainScaleGAN is used to restore it. The developed model outperforms one of the leading precipitation downscaling method found in the literature. RainScaleGAN not only generates a synthetic dataset featuring plausible high-resolution spatial patterns and intensities, but also produces a precipitation distribution with statistics closely mirroring those of the ground-truth dataset. Given that RainScaleGAN's approach is agnostic with respect to the underlying physics, the method has the potential to be applied to other physical variables such as surface winds or temperature.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting for Dynamical Systems with Missing or Imperfect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems is essential in many fields, but applying machine learning techniques is often challenging due to incomplete or noisy data. This study introduces a variant of stochastic interpolation (SI) for probabilistic forecasting, estimating future states as distributions rather than single-point predictions. We explore its mathematical foundations and demonstrate its effectiveness on various dynamical systems, including the challenging WeatherBench dataset.</description>

      <title>Integrating mobile and fixed monitoring data for high-resolution PM2.5 mapping using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing high resolution air pollution maps at lower cost is crucial for sustainable city management and public health risk assessment. However, traditional fixed-site monitoring lacks spatial coverage, while mobile low-cost sensors exhibit significant data instability. This study integrates PM2.5 data from 320 taxi-mounted mobile low-cost sensors and 52 fixed monitoring stations to address these limitations. By employing the machine learning methods, an appropriate mapping relationship was established between fixed and mobile monitoring concentration. The resulting pollution maps achieved 500-meter spatial and 5-minute temporal resolutions, showing close alignment with fixed monitoring data (+4.35% bias) but significant deviation from raw mobile data (-31.77%). The fused map exhibits the fine-scale spatial variability also observed in the mobile pollution map, while showing the stable temporal variability closer to that of the fixed pollution map (fixed: 1.12 plus or minus 0.73%, mobile: 3.15 plus or minus 2.44%, mapped: 1.01 plus or minus 0.65%). These findings demonstrate the potential of large-scale mobile low-cost sensor networks for high-resolution air quality mapping, supporting targeted urban environmental governance and health risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>On the modeling of nonlinear wind-induced ice-drift ocean currents at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the governing equations for geophysical flows, by means of a thin-shell approximation and a tangent plane approximation, we derive the equations describing, at leading order, the nonlinear ice-drift flow for regions centered around the North Pole. An exact solution is derived in the material/Lagrangian formalism, describing a superposition of oscillations, a mean Ekman flow and a geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Simulating Nighttime Visible Satellite Imagery of Tropical Cyclones Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible (VIS) imagery is important for monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs) but is unavailable at night. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to generate nighttime VIS imagery with significantly enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution. Our method offers three key improvements compared to existing models. First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Investigating the contribution of terrain-following coordinates and conservation schemes in AI-driven precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce "blurry" precipitation forecasts that overestimate drizzle and underestimate extremes. This study provides a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates with global mass and energy conservation schemes into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this solution using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0-degree grid spacing data. Verification results show large performance gains. The conservation schemes are found to reduce drizzle bias, whereas using terrain-following coordinates improves the estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Furthermore, a case study reveals that terrain-following coordinates capture near-surface winds better over mountains, offering AIWP models more accurate information on understanding the dynamics of precipitation processes. The proposed solution of this study can benefit a wide range of AIWP models and bring insights into how atmospheric domain knowledge can support the development of AIWP models.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Constrained Neural Differential Equation Framework for Data-Driven Snowpack Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-constrained neural differential equation framework for parameterization, and employs it to model the time evolution of seasonal snow depth given hydrometeorological forcings. When trained on data from multiple SNOTEL sites, the parameterization predicts daily snow depth with under 9% median error and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies over 0.94 across a wide variety of snow climates. The parameterization also generalizes to new sites not seen during training, which is not often true for calibrated snow models. Requiring the parameterization to predict snow water equivalent in addition to snow depth only increases error to ~12%. The structure of the approach guarantees the satisfaction of physical constraints, enables these constraints during model training, and allows modeling at different temporal resolutions without additional retraining of the parameterization. These benefits hold potential in climate modeling, and could extend to other dynamical systems with physical constraints.</description>
