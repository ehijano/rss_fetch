      <title>Completing the Quantum Reconstruction Program via the Relativity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how the disparate kinematics of quantum mechanics (finite-dimensional Hilbert space of QM) and special relativity (Minkowski spacetime from the Lorentz transformations of SR) can both be based on one principle (relativity principle). This is made possible by the axiomatic reconstruction of QM via information-theoretic principles, which has successfully recast QM as a principle theory a la SR. That is, in the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) and SR, the formalisms (Hilbert space and Lorentz transformations, respectively) are derived from empirically discovered facts (Information Invariance &amp; Continuity and light postulate, respectively), so QM and SR are "principle theories" as defined by Einstein. While SR has a compelling fundamental principle to justify its empirically discovered fact (relativity principle), QRP has not produced a compelling fundamental principle or causal mechanism to account for its empirically discovered fact. To unify these disparate kinematics, we show how the relativity principle ("no preferred reference frame" NPRF) can also be used to justify Information Invariance &amp; Continuity. We do this by showing that when QRP's operational notion of measurement is spatialized, Information Invariance &amp; Continuity entails the empirically discovered fact that everyone measures the same value for Planck's constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations or locations (Planck postulate). Since Poincare transformations relate inertial reference frames via spatial rotations and translations as well as boosts, the relativity principle justifies the Planck postulate just like it justifies the light postulate. Essentially, NPRF + c is an adynamical global constraint over the spacetime configuration of worldtubes for bodily objects while NPRF + h is an adynamical global constraint over the distribution of quanta among those bodily objects.</description>

      <title>Bell Correlations via Constrained Colliders -- a Path from W to V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work with Ken Wharton, I have proposed that Bell correlations are a special sort of selection artefact, explained by a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. This hypothesis requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a new way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. This piece outlines a new argument for the proposal. It explains how it is valid for a special class of (W-shaped) Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argues that it can be extended to the general (V-shaped) case.</description>

      <title>A review of 70 years with astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1953 I heard of an experiment in 1925 by Bengt Str\"omgren where he observed transit times with the meridian circle at the Copenhagen University Observatory measuring the current in a photocell behind slits when a star was crossing. In 1954 just 22 years old I was given the task as a student to make first test observations with a new meridian circle of the observatory. I became fascinated by the instrument and by the importance of astrometry for astronomy. Work at four meridian circles, two in Denmark, one in Hamburg, one in Lund, and Pierre Lacroute's vision of space astrometry in France had by 1973 created the foundation for development of the Hipparcos satellite, and Gaia followed. In 2013 I proposed a successor satellite which has gained momentum especially thanks to the efforts of David Hobbs and it has a good chance to be launched by ESA about 2045. But 70 years ago, optical astrometry was considered a dying branch of astronomy, unattractive compared with astrophysics. The following growth built on the still active interest in astrometry in Europe in those years and it was supported by ESA, the European Space Agency. This review is only about astrometry where I was personally involved.</description>
