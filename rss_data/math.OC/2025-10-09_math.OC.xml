      <title>State Constrained Optimal Control Problems With Control On The Acceleration. Applications To Kinetic Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on the careful study of a related problem in the calculus of variations, we study a class of optimal control problems in which the control lies on the acceleration, with state constraints on the position variable. In dimension one, we find explicit formulas in the special case when the running cost is a power of the acceleration (in absolute value) and the terminal cost is zero. For more general costs or/and higher dimensions, we study the singularities of the value function. We also prove the closedness (in the C 1 topology) of the graph of the multivalued mapping which maps a point in the state space to the set of optimal trajectories which start from this point. A consequence of the latter is the existence, under general assumptions, of relaxed equilibria for a class of kinetic mean field games with state constraints.</description>

      <title>Variable aggregation-based formulations for pumped storage hydro model in the day-ahead unit commitment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pumped storage hydro (PSH) plants can improve the flexibility of power systems. A well-designed formulation for a PSH model is essential when incorporating the PSH units into a day-ahead unit commitment model. In the literature, the formulation of a PSH model is generally based on the individual PSH unit. This formulation is tight if there is only one PSH unit in the reservoir. However, when there are multiple units sharing the same reservoir in a PSH plant, the existing formulation may introduce some symmetric structures which degrade the efficiency of a mixed-integer programming solver significantly. In this paper, to cope with the symmetric structure in the PSH plants that have multiple units, we propose two new formulations. The first formulation considers the case in which there are multiple identical units sharing the same reservoir. The second formulation considers a general case in which the units sharing the same reservoir have the same generating and pumping efficiency. Using the new formulations, the symmetric structures in the problem can be effectively broken. Numerical results are presented to study the computational efficiency of the new formulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Price Adjustment for Fisher Markets with Exact Recovery of Competitive Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical price-adjustment process, t\^atonnement, typically fails to converge to the exact competitive equilibrium (CE) and requires a high iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ to compute $\epsilon$-CE prices in widely studied linear and quasi-linear Fisher markets. This paper proposes refined price-adjustment processes to overcome these limitations. By formulating the task of finding CE of a (quasi-)linear Fisher market as a strongly convex nonsmooth minimization problem, we develop a novel accelerated price-adjustment method (APM) that finds an $\epsilon$-CE price in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ lightweight iterations, which significantly improves upon the iteration complexities of t\^atonnement methods. Furthermore, through our new formulation, we construct a recovery oracle that maps approximate CE prices to exact CE prices at a low computational cost. By coupling this recovery oracle with APM, we obtain an adaptive price-adjustment method whose iterates converge to CE prices in finite steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee to exact CE for price-adjustment methods in linear and quasi-linear Fisher markets. Our developments pave the way for efficient lightweight computation of CE prices. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed methods and the efficient recovery of CE prices.</description>

      <title>A unified optimal control framework: time-optimal control and stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic optimal control framework that bridges time-optimal control problems and classical stochastic optimal control problems. Unlike traditional deterministic time-optimal control formulations, our framework incorporates a generalized stochastic control structure under minimum-time constraints. Here, the minimum-time condition characterizes the earliest achievable moment for reaching a target state in expectation, rendering the terminal time an endogenous control-dependent variable. The main contributions of this study are: deriving an extended stochastic maximum principle for the proposed model, and establishing a bang-bang type optimal control for the linear time-optimal control problem. This unified stochastic optimal control framework enables optimal strategy design across finance, autonomous systems, and supply chains by simultaneously minimizing operational costs and achieving statistically-defined targets at the earliest feasible time.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Aware Model Predictive Control for Battery Swapping Stations under Energy Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery swapping stations (BSS) offer a fast and scalable alternative to conventional electric vehicle (EV) charging, gaining growing policy support worldwide. However, existing BSS control strategies typically rely on heuristics or low-fidelity degradation models, limiting profitability and service level. This paper proposes BSS-MPC: a real-time, degradation-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for BSS operations to trade off economic incentives from energy market arbitrage and long-term battery degradation effects. BSS-MPC integrates a high-fidelity, physics informed battery aging model that accurately predicts the degradation level and the remaining capacity of battery packs. The resulting multiscale optimization-jointly considering energy arbitrage, swapping logistics, and battery health-is formulated as a mixed-integer optimal control problem and solved with tailored algorithms. Simulation results show that BSS-MPC outperforms rule-based and low-fidelity baselines, achieving lower energy cost, reduced capacity fade, and strict satisfaction of EV swapping demands.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for kernel quantile regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel Quantile Regression (KQR) extends classical quantile regression to nonlinear settings using kernel methods, offering powerful tools for modeling conditional distributions. However, its application to large-scale datasets is severely limited by the computational burden of the large, dense kernel matrix and the need to efficiently solve large, often ill-conditioned linear systems. Existing state-of-the-art solvers usually struggle with scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient two-phase optimization algorithm tailored for large-scale KQR. In the first phase, we employ an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute a high-quality warm-start solution. The second phase refines this solution using an efficient semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). A key innovation of our approach is a specialized preconditioning strategy that leverages low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix to effectively mitigate the ill-conditioning of the linear systems in the Newton steps of the ALM. This can significantly accelerate iterative solvers for linear systems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art commercial and specialized KQR solvers in terms of speed and scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Lower-Order Implementations of Higher-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for minimizing non-convex functions with Lipschitz continuous $p$th-order derivatives, starting from $p \geq 1$. The method, however, only requires derivative information up to order $(p-1)$, since the $p$th-order derivatives are approximated via finite differences. To ensure oracle efficiency, instead of computing finite-difference approximations at every iteration, we reuse each approximation for $m$ consecutive iterations before recomputing it, with $m \geq 1$ as a key parameter. As a result, we obtain an adaptive method of order $(p-1)$ that requires no more than $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p}})$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the objective function and that, for the choice $m=(p-1)n + 1$, where $n$ is the problem dimension, takes no more than $O(n^{1/p}\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p}})$ oracle calls of order $(p-1)$. This improves previously known bounds for tensor methods with finite-difference approximations in terms of the problem dimension.</description>

      <title>Optimal domains for the Cheeger inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the scale invariant shape functional $${\mathcal{F}}_{p,q}(\Omega)=\frac{\lambda_p^{1/p}(\Omega)}{\lambda_q^{1/q}(\Omega)},$$ where $1\le q&lt;p\le+\infty$ and $\lambda_p(\Omega)$ (respectively $\lambda_q(\Omega)$) is the first eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_p$ (respectively $-\Delta_q$) with Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial\Omega$. We study both the maximization and minimization problems for ${\mathcal{F}}_{p,q}$, and show the existence of optimal domains in ${\mathbb{R}}^d$, along with some of their qualitative properties. Surprisingly, the case of a bounded box $D$ constraint $$\max\Big\{\lambda_q(\Omega)\ :\ \Omega\subset D,\ \lambda_p(\Omega)=1\Big\},$$ leads to a problem of different nature, for which the existence of a solution is shown by analyzing optimal capacitary measures. In the last section we list some interesting questions that, in our opinion, deserve to be investigated.</description>

      <title>Frictional martingale optimal transport and robust hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study martingale optimal transport (MOT) with state-dependent trading frictions and develop a geometric-duality framework that extends from one time-step to the multi-marginal setting. Building on the frictionless left-monotone structure (Beiglb\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab. 2016; Henry-Labord\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\"ock et al, Ann. Probab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a frictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic disintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a no-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is characterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off the band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an equal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs.
  We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a dynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and stability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals and friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to the frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions, motivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001; Obizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ. Mark. 2013), we obtain explicit off-band displacements and comparative statics in liquidity parameters. Applications include model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian options. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\"ock et al, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine geometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability, and computation in multi-marginal robust pricing.</description>

      <title>Composite Lyapunov Criteria for Stability and Convergence with Applications to Optimization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a composite Lyapunov framework for nonlinear autonomous systems that ensures strict decay through a pair of differential inequalities. The approach yields integral estimates, quantitative convergence rates, vanishing of dissipation measures, convergence to a critical set, and semistability under mild conditions, without relying on invariance principles or compactness assumptions. The framework unifies convergence to points and sets and is illustrated through applications to inertial gradient systems and Primal--Dual gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum Grid Path Planning Using Parallel QAOA Circuits Based on Minimum Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.</description>

      <title>A control-based spatial source reconstruction in fractional heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse source problem for a nonlocal heat equation involving the fractional Laplacian. The primary goal is to reconstruct the spatial component of the source term from partial observations of the system's state and its time derivative over a subset of the domain. A reconstruction formula for the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source is derived, leveraging the null controllability property of the fractional heat equation when the fractional order lies in the interval $s\in(1/2,1)$. The methodology builds on spectral analysis and Volterra integral equations, providing a robust framework for recovering spatial sources under limited measurement data. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Stability with respect to periodic switching laws does not imply global stability under arbitrary switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: R. Shorten, F. Wirth, O. Mason, K. Wulff and C. King have asked whether a linear switched system is guaranteed to be globally uniformly stable under arbitrary switching if it is known that every trajectory induced by a periodic switching law converges exponentially to the origin. Positive answers to this question have previously been announced for linear switched systems of order two and three. We answer this question negatively in all higher orders by constructing a fourth-order linear switched system with four switching states which is not uniformly exponentially stable but which has the property that every trajectory defined by a periodic switching law converges exponentially to the origin. We argue informally that positive linear systems with this combination of properties are likely to exist in sufficiently high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Reverse Supply Chain Network Design of a Polyurethane Waste Upcycling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general mathematical programming framework for the design and optimization of supply chain infrastructures for the upcycling of plastic waste. For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply chain network over a specified period. The functionality of the framework has been tested with a case study for the upcycling of rigid polyurethane foam waste coming from construction sites in Germany. The economic potential and infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration. However, with the right economic incentives, there is a considerable potential to establish such value chains, once the upcycling technology is ready and the economic framework conditions have stabilized.</description>

      <title>Modelling and evaluating travel information during disruptions: An illustrative example from Swedish railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely travel information is an asset for enhancing passenger travel experience during normal traffic, and for mitigating the discomforts during disruptions. With longer and more frequent disruptions as well as increasing ridership, traffic delays can incur substantial costs for passengers and other transport stakeholders, e.g., operators and infrastructure managers. Such costs can, however, be reduced thanks to effective travel information strategies during traffic disruptions. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation model to assess the value of travel information under different scenarios. Focusing on real-time travel information to train passengers, accessibility benefits are quantified in monetary terms based on historical delay distributions, timing of travel information (pre/on-trip) and ridership. Using a case study from the Swedish railways, the model is showcased and applied to a commuter line in Stockholm. The experimental results indicate individual valuations that are higher than references and savings at the system level of at least 23% of the delay costs. Further testing of the model, e.g., on larger-scale scenarios, and including transfer trips, is a possible direction for future works.</description>

      <title>Exponential Speed-ups for Structured Goemans-Williamson relaxations via Quantum Gibbs States and Pauli Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees.
  In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states.
  We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory optimisation using finite-horizon, decoherence time and discounted mean-square performance criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum memory systems for approximately retaining quantum information, such as initial dynamic variables or quantum states to be stored over a bounded time interval. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schr\"{o}dinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.</description>

      <title>Reliability of Single-Level Equality-Constrained Inverse Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a classical bilevel implementation.</description>

      <title>On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Kaczmarz Iterates Gone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm is one of the most computationally and memory-efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems. However, practical applications often involve noisy and potentially inconsistent systems. While the convergence of RK is well understood for consistent systems, the study of RK on noisy, inconsistent linear systems is limited. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates in expectation when solving noisy and inconsistent systems, addressing the locations of their limit points. We explore the roles of singular vectors of the (noisy) coefficient matrix and derive bounds on the convergence horizon, which depend on the noise levels and system characteristics. Finally, we provide extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings, offering practical insights into the algorithm's performance under realistic conditions. These results establish a deeper understanding of the RK algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, paving the way for optimized applications in real-world scientific and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>TiAda: A Time-scale Adaptive Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods have shown their ability to adjust the stepsizes on the fly in a parameter-agnostic manner, and empirically achieve faster convergence for solving minimization problems. When it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic and can achieve near-optimal complexities simultaneously in deterministic and stochastic settings of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further justified numerically for a number of machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Provable non-accelerations of the heavy-ball method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the heavy-ball ($\HB$) method provably does not reach an accelerated convergence rate on smooth strongly convex problems. More specifically, we show that for any condition number and any choice of algorithmic parameters, either the worst-case convergence rate of $\HB$ on the class of $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex \textit{quadratic} functions is not accelerated (that is, slower than $1 - \mathcal{O}(\kappa)$), or there exists an $L$-smooth $\mu$-strongly convex function and an initialization such that the method does not converge.
  To the best of our knowledge, this result closes a simple yet open question on one of the most used and iconic first-order optimization technique.
  Our approach builds on finding functions for which $\HB$ fails to converge and instead cycles over finitely many iterates. We analytically describe all parametrizations of $\HB$ that exhibit this cycling behavior on a particular cycle shape, whose choice is supported by a systematic and constructive approach to the study of cycling behaviors of first-order methods. We show the robustness of our results to perturbations of the cycle, and extend them to class of functions that also satisfy higher-order regularity conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study discrete-time absorbing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with measurable state space and Borel action space with a given initial distribution. For such models, solutions to the characteristic equation that are not occupation measures may exist. Several necessary and sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that any solution to the characteristic equation is an occupation measure. Under the so-called continuity-compactness conditions, it is shown that the set of occupation measures is compact in the weak-strong topology if and only if the model is uniformly absorbing. Finally, it is shown that the occupation measures are characterized by the characteristic equation and an additional condition. Several examples are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>It's All in the Mix: Wasserstein Classification and Regression with Mixed Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem definition: A key challenge in supervised learning is data scarcity, which can cause prediction models to overfit to the training data and perform poorly out of sample. A contemporary approach to combat overfitting is offered by distributionally robust problem formulations that consider all data-generating distributions close to the empirical distribution derived from historical samples, where 'closeness' is determined by the Wasserstein distance. While such formulations show significant promise in prediction tasks where all input features are continuous, they scale exponentially when discrete features are present. Methodology/results: We demonstrate that distributionally robust mixed-feature classification and regression problems can indeed be solved in polynomial time. Our proof relies on classical ellipsoid method-based solution schemes that do not scale well in practice. To overcome this limitation, we develop a practically efficient (yet, in the worst case, exponential time) cutting plane-based algorithm that admits a polynomial time separation oracle, despite the presence of exponentially many constraints. We compare our method against alternative techniques both theoretically and empirically on standard benchmark instances. Managerial implications: Data-driven operations management problems often involve prediction models with discrete features. We develop and analyze distributionally robust prediction models that faithfully account for the presence of discrete features, and we demonstrate that our models can significantly outperform existing methods that are agnostic to the presence of discrete features, both theoretically and on standard benchmark instances.</description>

Abstract: An iterative learning algorithm is presented for continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems where the system is externally symmetric with unknown dynamics. Both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon problems are considered. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent to the optimal solution and has some advantages over adaptive dynamic programming, including being unbiased under noisy measurements and having a relatively low computational burden. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), primarily due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the non-stationarity of optimal policies. In this work, we study a natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm that integrates recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures into a natural policy gradient (NPG) method and a temporal difference (TD) learning method. This framework leverages the representational capacity of RNNs to address non-stationarity in RL to solve POMDPs while retaining the statistical and computational efficiency of natural gradient methods in RL. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees for this method, including bounds on sample and iteration complexity to achieve global optimality up to function approximation. Additionally, we characterize pathological cases that stem from long-term dependencies, thereby explaining limitations of RNN-based policy optimization for POMDPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polyhedron is pointed if it contains at least one vertex. Every pointed polyhedron P in R^n can be described by an H-representation consisting of half spaces or equivalently by a V-representation consisting of the convex hull of a set of vertices and extreme rays. We can define matrices H(P) and V(P), each with n + 1 columns, that encode these representations. Define polyhedron Q by setting H(Q)=V(P). We show that Q is the polar of P. Call P HV-symmetric if V(Q) in turn encodes the H-representation of P. It is well known and often stated that polytopes that contain the origin in their interior and pointed polyhedral cones are HV-symmetric. We show here that, more generally, a pointed polyhedron with pointed polar is HV-symmetric if and only if it contains the origin. We show this using Minkowski's bipolar equation and discuss implications for the vertex and facet enumeration problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of structured nonsmooth optimization problems over an embedded submanifold of a Euclidean space, where the first part of the objective is the sum of a difference-of-convex (DC) function and a smooth function, while the remaining part is a weakly convex function over a smooth function. This model problem has many important applications in machine learning and scientific computing, for example, the sparse Fisher discriminant analysis. We propose a manifold proximal-gradient-subgradient algorithm (MPGSA) and show that under mild conditions any accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by it is a critical point of the underlying problem. By assuming the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of an auxiliary function, we further establish the convergence of the full sequence generated by MPGSA under some suitable conditions. When the second component of the DC function involved is the maximum of finite continuously differentiable convex functions, we also propose an enhanced MPGSA with guaranteed subsequential convergence to a lifted B-stationary points of the optimization problem. Finally, some preliminary numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance is a metric for quantifying distributional uncertainty and assessing the sensitivity of stochastic optimization problems on time series data. A computationally efficient alternative to it, is provided by the entropically regularized adapted Wasserstein distance. Suffering from similar shortcomings as classical optimal transport, there are only few explicitly known solutions to those distances.
  Recently, Gunasingam--Wong provided a closed-form representation of the adapted Wasserstein distance between real-valued stochastic processes with Gaussian laws. In this paper, we extend their work in two directions, by considering multidimensional ($\mathbb{R}^d$-valued) stochastic processes with Gaussian laws and including the entropic regularization. In both settings, we provide closed-form solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a class of mean-field control (MFC) problems with singular control under general dynamic state-control-law constraints. We first propose a customized relaxed control formulation to cope with the dynamic mixed constraints and establish the existence of an optimal control using compactification argument in the proper canonical spaces to accommodate the singular control. To characterize the optimal pair of regular and singular controls, we treat the controlled McKean-Vlasov process as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint and recast the MFC problem as an optimization problem on canonical spaces with constraints on Banach space, allowing us to derive the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and a constrained BSDE using a novel Lagrange multipliers method. Additionally, we investigate the uniqueness and the stability result of the solution to the constrained FBSDE associated to the constrained MFC problem with singular control.</description>

      <title>Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling using Successive Moreau Envelopes [journal paper]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ by considering a family $(\pi^{t})_t$ of approximations of the target density which is such that $\pi^{t}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling when $t$ is large, and $\pi^{t} \to \pi$ as $t \to 0$. This sequence is obtained by replacing (parts of) the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelope. Through the sequential sampling from $\pi^{t}$ for decreasing values of $t$ by a Langevin algorithm with appropriate step size, the samples are guided from a simple starting density to the more complex target quickly. We prove the ergodicity of the method as well as its convergence to the target density without assuming convexity or differentiability of the potential $U$. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we show experimental results that support the superiority of the method in terms of convergence speed and mode-coverage of multi-modal densities to current algorithms. The experiments range from one-dimensional toy-problems to high-dimensional inverse imaging problems with learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and Real-Time Operation of Networked Microgrids Under Load Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution networks are increasingly exposed to threats such as extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and cyber risks--resulting in more frequent contingencies and outages, a trend likely to persist. Microgrids, particularly dynamic networked microgrids (DNMGs), offer a promising solution to mitigate the impacts of such contingencies and enhance resiliency. However, distribution networks present unique challenges due to their unbalanced nature and the inherent uncertainty in both loads and generation. This paper builds upon our prior work on the two-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem for configuring DNMGs, improving the solve time and scalability. Furthermore, we present a model-free, real-time optimal power flow algorithm to manage DNMG operations in the time between reconfigurations. A case study on a realistic network based on part of the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrates the scalability of both approaches. The case study also illustrates the ability to maintain power flow feasibility as loads vary and operating conditions change when the methods are used in tandem.</description>

      <title>PDCS: A Primal-Dual Large-Scale Conic Programming Solver with GPU Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver (PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Frequency Domain Full-Waveform Inversion via HV-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional frequency-domain full-waveform inversion (FWI) is typically implemented with an $L^2$ misfit function, which suffers from challenges such as cycle skipping and sensitivity to noise. While the Wasserstein metric has proven effective in addressing these issues in time-domain FWI, its applicability in frequency-domain FWI is limited due to the complex-valued nature of the data and reduced transport-like dependency on wave speed. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the HV metric ($d_{\text{HV}}$), inspired by optimal transport theory, which compares signals based on horizontal and vertical changes without requiring the normalization of data. We implement $d_{\text{HV}}$ as the misfit function in frequency-domain FWI and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real-world datasets from seismic imaging and ultrasound computed tomography (USCT). Numerical experiments demonstrate that $d_{\text{HV}}$ outperforms the $L^2$ and Wasserstein metrics in scenarios with limited prior model information and high noise while robustly improving inversion results on clinical USCT data.</description>

      <title>Leaf it to renewal: Improved predictive maintenance policies via renewal theory and decision trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general method for deriving prognostics-based predictive maintenance policies. The method takes into account the available decision options at hand, the information on the future state of the system provided by a prognostic model, as well as the costs of the underlying renewal-reward process. It results in heuristic policies with only a few parameters, which can be determined based on theoretical considerations or by optimization from run-to-failure data. We show the potential of the method on two separate predictive maintenance decision settings, namely preventive replacement and preventive ordering. Numerical investigations show that the derived heuristic policies achieve significantly lower cost ratios than other benchmark heuristic policies, while at the same time being more robust against overfitting.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where the speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>

      <title>A Branch-Price-Cut-And-Switch Approach for Optimizing Team Formation and Routing for Airport Baggage Handling Tasks with Stochastic Travel Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage handling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient processes. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and propose a novel solution approach that we call Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Free Universum Quadratic Surface Twin Support Vector Machines for Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary classification tasks with imbalanced classes pose significant challenges in machine learning. Traditional classifiers often struggle to accurately capture the characteristics of the minority class, resulting in biased models with subpar predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tackle this issue by leveraging Universum points to support the minority class within quadratic twin support vector machine models. Unlike traditional classifiers, our models utilize quadratic surfaces instead of hyperplanes for binary classification, providing greater flexibility in modeling complex decision boundaries. By incorporating Universum points, our approach enhances classification accuracy and generalization performance on imbalanced datasets. We generated four artificial datasets to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methods. Additionally, we validated the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, showing superior performance compared to conventional classifiers and existing methods for imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frontier Exploration on Graphs with Applications to Network-Based Disease Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $\mathcal{G}$ where each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Omega}$, drawn from a joint distribution $\mathcal{P}$ that is Markov with respect to $\mathcal{G}$. At each step, selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when $\mathcal{G}$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ time while using $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ oracle calls to $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines, including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example, in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested, substantially outperforming other baselines.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-inverse of a line graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph, essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved. Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our theoretical results work in practice.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.</description>

      <title>Optimal network pricing with oblivious users: a new model and algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic modeling is important in modern society. In this work we propose a new model on the optimal network pricing (Onp) with the assumption of oblivious users, in which the users remain oblivious to real-time traffic conditions and others' behavior. Inspired by works on transportation research and network pricing for selfish traffic, we mathematically derive and prove a new formulation of Onp with decision-dependent modeling that relax certain existing modeling constraints in the literature. Then, we express the Onp formulation as a constrained nonconvex stochastic quadratic program with uncertainty, and we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, utilizing graph theory, sparse linear algebra and stochastic approximation. Lastly, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the usefulness of the new Onp formulation. The proposed algorithm achieves a 5x speedup by exploiting the sparsity structure of the model.</description>
