      <title>Towards self-consistent models for Inflation and Early Universe Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this PhD thesis we take smalls steps towards linking our knowledge of the Early Universe with our knowledge of particle physics. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 deal with Higgs inflation UV completions and their phenomenology. In Chapter 6 we consider a model for natural inflation with twin waterfalls, in which a Z2 symmetry is responsible for the radiative stability of the potential. Including a separate Z2' symmetry allows us to identify one of the waterfall fields with Dark Matter, that can be sufficiently produced during preheating. In Chapter 7, we take conformal couplings and expand around the pole of the Einstein-frame kinetic term. Using this structure we can recover successful Higgs inflation without the need of a large non-minimal coupling. Finally, in Chapter 8 we apply the setup to the Peccei-Quinn field responsible for the axion solution the Strong CP problem, and reproduce the observed Dark Matter relic abundance through the axion kinetic misalignment mechanism.</description>

      <title>Origins and impacts of dynamical diquark correlations -- A continuum Schwinger functional approach --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This conference proceedings contribution emphasizes the emergent hadron mass paradigm, which accounts for the majority of the visible mass in the universe, beyond the Higgs boson mechanism. The study delves into the Landau gauge gluon propagator and the dynamical generation of gluon mass, as well as the dressed-quark propagator and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. It also tackles the baryon bound state problem through the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, analyzing the composition and masses of octet and decuplet baryons. The document concludes with a discussion on the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and its first radial excitation, providing insights into the quark-diquark structure within baryons.</description>

      <title>FPF@FCC: Neutrino, QCD, and BSM Physics Opportunities with Far-Forward Experiments at a 100 TeV Proton Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-proton collisions at energy-frontier facilities produce an intense flux of high-energy light particles, including neutrinos, in the forward direction. At the LHC, these particles are currently being studied with the far-forward experiments FASER/FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC, while new dedicated experiments have been proposed in the context of a Forward Physics Facility (FPF) operating at the HL-LHC. Here we present a first quantitative exploration of the reach for neutrino, QCD, and BSM physics of far-forward experiments integrated within the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC) project as part of its proton-proton collision program (FCC-hh) at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 100$ TeV. We find that $10^9$ electron/muon neutrinos and $10^7$ tau neutrinos could be detected, an increase of several orders of magnitude compared to (HL-)LHC yields. We study the impact of neutrino DIS measurements at the FPF@FCC to constrain the unpolarised and spin partonic structure of the nucleon and assess their sensitivity to nuclear dynamics down to $x \sim 10^{-9}$ with neutrinos produced in proton-lead collisions. We demonstrate that the FPF@FCC could measure the neutrino charge radius for $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_\mu$ and reach down to five times the SM value for $\nu_\tau$. We fingerprint the BSM sensitivity of the FPF@FCC for a variety of models, including dark Higgs bosons, relaxion-type scenarios, quirks, and millicharged particles, finding that these experiments would be able to discover LLPs with masses as large as 50 GeV and couplings as small as $10^{-8}$, and quirks with masses up to 10 TeV. Our study highlights the remarkable opportunities made possible by integrating far-forward experiments into the FCC project, and it provides new motivation for the FPF at the HL-LHC as an essential precedent to optimize the forward physics experiments that will enable the FCC to achieve its full physics potential.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When light primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate in the early Universe, they locally reheat the surrounding plasma, creating hot spots with temperatures that can be significantly higher than the average plasma temperature. In this work, we provide a general framework for calculating the probability that a particle interacting with the Standard Model can escape the hot spot. More specifically, we consider how these hot spots influence the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) in leptogenesis scenarios, as well as the production of dark matter (DM). For leptogenesis, we find that PBH-produced right-handed neutrinos can contribute to the BAU even if the temperature of the Universe is below the electroweak phase transition temperature, since sphaleron processes may still be active within the hot spot. For DM, particles emitted by PBHs may thermalise with the heated plasma within the hot spot, effectively preventing them from contributing to the observed relic abundance. Our work highlights the importance of including hot spots in the interplay of PBHs and early Universe observables</description>

      <title>Modular flavored dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries have been an appealing approach for explaining the observed flavor structure, which is not justified in the Standard Model (SM). Typically, these models require a so-called flavon field in order to give rise to the flavor structure upon the breaking of the flavor symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the flavon. Generally, in order to obtain the desired vacuum alignment, a flavon potential that includes additional so-called driving fields is required. On the other hand, allowing the flavor symmetry to be modular leads to a structure where the couplings are all holomorphic functions that depend only on a complex modulus, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters in the model. We show that these elements can be combined to simultaneously explain the flavor structure and dark matter (DM) relic abundance. We present a modular model with flavon vacuum alignment that allows for realistic flavor predictions while providing a successful fermionic DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>$Z^\prime$-mediated dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study freeze-in production of fermionic dark matter mediated by a $Z^\prime$ gauge boson. In particular, we explore the regime of Boltzmann-suppressed production, when the Standard Model (SM) thermal bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. The corresponding gauge coupling is then required to be significant, up to order one. As a result, this class of freeze-in models can be probed by the current and future direct dark matter detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Automated inclusion of QED corrections in Monte Carlo event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present automated, process-independent methods for the calculation of QED real radiative corrections. We review the construction of a parton shower based on Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction, and thus detail the implementation of a QED parton shower. We validate the predictions made by the shower against the YFS soft-photon resummation, and discuss the algorithmic choices made. We then present results for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC and its decay to leptons, showing that the interleaved QCD+QED parton shower predicts distributions in excellent agreement with the YFS approach. We then study the MC@NLO method for matching a next-to-leading order calculation with a parton shower. Showing that the method preserves its accuracy for the case of QED corrections and of mixed QCD and QED corrections, we present the QCD+QED MC@NLO method. Validating the method against both the YFS resummation and the QED parton shower, we find very good agreement. Finally, we present an extension to the YFS soft-photon resummation, in which we use a one-step parton shower to resum the logarithms associated with charged particle pair production. Throughout this thesis we also discuss the impact of dressed lepton definitions on observables. The methods presented in this thesis are made available in a public Monte Carlo event generator and analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Scalar radiation zeros at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet scalar extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics in which the scalar couples only to off-shell states. As a result, low-order tree-level processes involving the singlet scalar vanish, providing a unique phenomenology that may allow to evade existing constraints on new singlet scalar fields. We describe search strategies for such states at the Large Hadron Collider and identify the parameter space that can be explored in the future.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Inflation, Baryon Asymmetry, and Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that simultaneously addresses some of the most intriguing puzzles in particle physics and cosmology, namely the origins of neutrino mass, baryon asymmetry, and cosmic inflation. In our model, inflation is driven by a combination of the Standard Model Higgs, the type II seesaw Higgs responsible for neutrino mass generation, and the unified symmetry-breaking Higgs field. During inflation, non-zero values of the latter field ensure the absence of the monopole problem. The baryon asymmetry is generated through the Affleck-Dine mechanism, facilitated by the non-zero angular motion in the phase of a complex scalar field, which is part of the inflaton. We find that the successful parameter region for generating baryon asymmetry through a renormalizable term in the scalar potential requires a rather heavy type II seesaw triplet, with a mass well beyond the TeV scale. Inflationary observables, in particular, the spectral index is in excellent agree with experimental observation, whereas tensor-to scalar ratio is expected to be probed by the future LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 missions.</description>

      <title>Sphaleron and gravitational wave with the Higgs-Dilaton potential in the Standard Model Two-Time Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a Higgs-Dilaton potential, the 2T model has full triggering for a first order electroweak phase transition, namely for the mass of Dilaton between $300 $ GeV and $550$ GeV. We have also compared the transition strengths in the case with and without daisay loops, the difference being always less than $0.2$. The effective Higgs potential has given a sphaleron energy less than $8.4$ TeV. The value of $\beta/H^*$ is larger than $25$ and less than $34$ in all cases that are sufficient to trigger the first order electroweak phase transition. Gravitational wave energy density caused by this transition, may be sufficiently detected by future detectors, could indirectly confirm Dilaton.</description>

      <title>Two-pole structure of the $h_1(1415)$ axial-vector meson: resolving mass discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate isoscalar axial-vector mesons using a coupled-channel formalism. The kernel amplitudes are constructed from meson-exchange diagrams in the $t$- and $u$-channels, which are derived from effective Lagrangians based on hidden local symmetry. We incorporate six channels: $\pi\rho$, $\eta\omega$, $K\bar{K}^*$, $\eta\phi$, $\eta'\omega$, and $\eta'\phi$, and solve the off-shell coupled integral equations. We first discuss the dynamical generation of the $h_1(1170)$. The pole diagram for $h_1(1595)$ has a certain effect on the generation of $h_1(1170)$. We observe two poles at $(1387-i6)$ MeV and $(1452-i51)$ MeV, which exhibit a two-pole structure of the $h_1(1415)$ meson. This two-pole structure may resolve the discrepancy in the experimental data on the mass of $h_1(1415)$. The results show that the lower pole couples strongly to the $K\bar{K}^*$ channel, while the higher pole couples predominantly to the $\eta\phi$ channel. This provides insights into the nature of $h_1$ mesons and explains ossible discrepancies in the mass of $h_1(1415)$.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tunable Targets for Light Dark Matter Direct Detection: The Case of Solid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose hydrostatic pressure -- a well-established tool for tuning properties of condensed matter -- as a novel route for optimizing targets for light dark matter direct detection, specifically via phonons. Pressure dramatically affects compressible solids by boosting the speed of sound and phonon frequencies. Focusing on helium -- the most compressible solid -- our ab initio calculations illustrate how high pressure elevates helium from lacking single-phonon reach to rivaling leading candidates. Our work establishes pressure as an unexplored tuning knob for accessing lower dark matter mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of $B_s$ to $D_s$ based on the helicity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing dipole and exponential hadronic transition form factors and helicity analysis combined with the Lattice QCD input, we present a detailed study of the decays $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\ell \nu_\ell$. $B_s \to D_s + P(V)$, where $P = \pi^+, K^+, D_s^+$ and $V = \rho^+, K^{*+}, D_s^{*+}$, are also investigated and their branching fractions are examined. At the large recoil point, we calculate $f_{ + ,0}^{{B_s} \to {D_s}}(0) = 0.67 \pm 0.01$ for both parameterizations. Then we evaluate the branching fractions $BR({B_s} \to {D_s}\ell \nu )$ and $BR({B_s} \to {D_s}\ell \nu )$, which leads to $R({D_s}) = 0.298 \pm 0.123$. The ratios $\frac{{\Gamma (B_s^0 \to D_s^ - {\mu ^ + }{\nu _\mu })}}{{\Gamma (B_s^0 \to D_s^{* - }{\mu ^ + }{\nu _\mu })}}$ are found to be $0.4415 \pm 0.1860$ and $0.4406 \pm 0.1854$, which are in good agreement of recent LHCb collaboration measurement. We also calculate the physical observables, $A_{FB}^\ell ,P_L^\ell ,P_T^\ell ,C_F^\ell ,F_L^\ell $.</description>

      <title>Axion Minicluster Halo Limits from Wide Binary Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axionic dark matter can form miniclusters and minicluster halos from inhomogenuities in the early Universe. If MCHs are sufficiently massive, their existence can be revealed by small-scale gravitational tidal perturbation to halo-like binary star system in the Galaxy. The observed population of the Milky Way's wide-separation binaries with $a\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.1)\,$ parsec offer a sensitive test to dynamic evaporation from MCHs. Considering data from recent GAIA observations, we derive significant constraints on the MCH fraction of the galactic dark matter halo. For several scenarios including dense MCHs and isolated minicluster models, these limits will apply to axion-like particles in the mass range $m_{a}\sim 10^{-15}-10^{-12}\,\rm eV$ and $m_{a}\sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\rm eV$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Twin electroweak bubble nucleation and gravitational wave under the $S_3$ symmetry of two-Higgs-doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sphaleron electroweak phase transirion (EWPT) is calculated in two phase transition stages, thereby showing that the twin (or double) bubble nucleation structure of the phase transition and gravitational wave is in the investigation area of future detectors. The parameter $a$ or $\tan\beta$ is the ratio between two vacuum average values (VEV) although it does not affect the strengh of EWPT but affect the sphaleron energy. However, it only causes this energy to increase slightly. As $a$ increases, the maximum difference of sphaleron energy in one stage is about $6.15$ TeV. $a$ affects the expansion of bubbles during two phase transitions. The more $a$ increases, the more the expansion of two bubbles is at the same time. This ratio does not greatly affect the sphaleron energy but has a strong impact on gravitational waves. The larger the masses of the charged Higgs particles is, the greater the gravitational wave energy density ($\Omega h^2$) is. When the frequency is in the range $0-1.2$ mHz, $\Omega h^2$ will has a maximum value in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ for all values of $a$ so this can be detected in the future.</description>

      <title>Explaining 95 (or so) GeV Anomalies in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I can explain some excesses recently seen at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states in turn matching Large Electron Positron (LEP) data in $b\bar b$ signatures, all anomalies residing over the 90-100 GeV or so region. The explanation to such anomalous data is found in the aforementioned scenario when in inverted mass hierarchy, in two configurations: i) when the lightest CP-even Higgs state is alone capable of reproducing the excesses; ii) when a combination of such a state and the CP-odd Higgs boson is able to do so. To test further this scenario, we present some Benchmark Points (BPs) of it amenable to phenomenological investigation.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Equations for the Dimension-7 SMEFT Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, a Green's basis and a new physical basis for dimension-seven (dim-7) operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) are proposed. The reduction relations between those two bases are also presented, where some redundant dim-6 operators in the Green's basis are involved if the dim-5 operator exists. Taking advantage of these two bases for dim-7 operators and the associated reduction relations, we work out the complete one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for dim-5 and dim-7 operators up to $\mathcal{O} \left( \Lambda^{-3} \right)$ in the SMEFT, including not only the mixing among the same dimensional operators but also that among different dimensional ones. These results can be exploited to study full one-loop RG effects on some lepton- or baryon-number-violating processes up to $\mathcal{O} \left( \Lambda^{-3} \right)$ in the SMEFT, such as neutrino masses, neutrinoless double beta decay, meson and nucleon decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of precise experimental measurements and theoretical predictions allows to extract Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements or constrain flavor changing processes in the standard model. Focusing at theoretical predictions, we review recent highlights from the sector of heavy charm and bottom quark decays. Special emphasis is given to nonperturbative contributions due to the strong force calculated using lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>An Extended Closure Relation by LightGBM for Neutrino Radiation Transport in Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a machine learning model using LightGBM, one of the most popular gradient boosting decision tree methods these days, to predict the Eddington tensor, or the second-order angular moment, for neutrino radiation transport in core-collapse supernova simulations. We use not only zero-th and first moments as in ordinary closure relations but also information on the background matter configuration extensively. For training the model we utilize some post-bounce snapshots from one of our previous Boltzmann radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The Eddington tensor as well as the zero-th and first angular moments are calculated from the neutrino distribution function obtained in the simulation. LightGBM is light indeed and its high efficiency in training enables us to feed a large number of features and figure out which features are more important than others. We report in this paper the results of the training and validation as well as the generalization of our model: it can reproduce the Eddington factor better in general than the M1-closure relation, one of the most commonly employed algebraic closure relations at present; the generalization performance is also much improved from our previous model based on the deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Muon collider probes of Majorana neutrino dipole moments and masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana neutrinos may have transitional dipole moments, which violate lepton number as well as lepton flavour. We estimate the sensitivity of future colliders to the electron-muon neutrino dipole moment, $\lambda_{e\mu}$, by considering same-sign dilepton final states. We find that hadron colliders, even the proposed FCC-hh upgrade, are sensitive only to $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\gtrsim 10^{-9}\mu_B$ (with $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton), a value two-three orders of magnitude larger than current bounds from astrophysics and low-energy neutrino-scattering experiments. In the case of a future muon collider, we show that the sensitivity varies from $|\lambda_{e\mu}|\sim 5\cdot 10^{-9}\mu_B$ for energy $\sqrt{s}\simeq 3$ TeV, to $\sim 10^{-12}\mu_B$ for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 50$ TeV, matching the current laboratory bounds for $\sqrt{s}\simeq 30$ TeV. The singular advantage of the muon collider signal would be a direct, clean identification of lepton number and flavour violation. We also show that a muon collider would improve by orders of magnitude the direct bounds on $m_{e\mu}$ and $m_{\mu\mu}$, two of the entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. These bounds could be as strong as $\sim 50$ keV, still far above the neutrino mass scale.</description>

      <title>The Interaction of Moving $\mathbf{Q\bar{Q}}$ and QQq in the Thermal Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of the force between heavy quarks is studied for heavy quarkonium ($\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$) and doubly heavy baryons ($\mathrm{QQq}$) at finite temperature and rapidity using the gauge/gravity duality in this paper. The strength of the interaction is defined as an effective running coupling $\alpha$ from lattice. By considering the $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and $\mathrm{QQq}$ moving through the thermal quark-gluon plasma, we find that the interaction of heavy quarks for $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ is small and remains almost constant when $L&lt;0.2\,\mathrm{fm}$. The strength of the interaction for $\mathrm{QQq}$ is always less than that for $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and approaches a constant when $L&lt;0.4\,\mathrm{fm}$. The $\alpha$ and the maximum of effective running coupling $\tilde{\alpha}$ for both $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and $\mathrm{QQq}$ decrease with increasing temperature or rapidity. Through comparison, we find that $\mathrm{QQq}$ is more sensitive to changes in temperature and rapidity, and the interaction force between quarks is always less than that of $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$, indicating that $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ is more stable than $\mathrm{QQq}$ in the presence of temperature and rapidity.</description>

      <title>Establishing CP violation in $b$-baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $CP$ violation (CPV) in the baryon system has not yet been definitively established. We demonstrate that individual partial-wave CPV in the $\Lambda_b\to p\pi^-,pK^-$ decays can exceed $10\%$, but the destruction between different partial waves results in small net direct CPV as observed in current experiments. There is thus high possibility of identifying CPV in $b$-baryon decays through measurements of partial-wave CPV. The above observation is supported by the first full QCD calculation of two-body hadronic $\Lambda_b$ baryon decays with controllable uncertainties in the perturbative QCD formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KNT(W) data-driven determinations of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) are crucial inputs to previous and future Standard Model (SM) predictions of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$. With the muon $g$$-$$2$'s new physics case uncertain due to disagreeing HVP evaluations, new SM predictions and experimental measurements of $a_\mu$ expected soon, and a complete revamp of the KNTW analysis framework underway, this letter motivates and describes a blinding scheme for data-driven HVP determinations that has been implemented for future KNTW analyses.</description>

      <title>Constraints for twist-two alien operators in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton evolution equations in QCD are controlled by the anomalous dimensions of gauge-invariant twist-two spin-$N$ quark and gluon operators. Under renormalization, these mix with gauge-variant operators of the same quantum numbers, referred to as alien operators. Our work addresses the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin $N$, using generalized BRST symmetry relations to derive their couplings and Feynman rules at all values of $N$. We observe how the all-$N$ structure of the generalized (anti-)BRST constraints relates the couplings of alien operators with $n+1$ gluons to those with $n$ gluons. Realizing a bootstrap, we present all one-loop results necessary for performing the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD.</description>

      <title>Single Pion Production off Free Nucleons: Analysis of Photon, Electron, Pion and Neutrino Induced Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a unified model for single-pion production across photo-, electro-, and neutrino-nucleon interactions, designed to be valid over a broad kinematic range that is crucial for accelerator-based neutrino experiments. This model includes vector and axial-vector nucleon transition form factors for all excited nucleons or resonances up to 2 GeV, as well as non-resonant backgrounds, within a meson dominance framework that adheres to QCD principles and ensures unitarity. This approach guarantees accurate asymptotic behaviour at high momentum transfer and effectively addresses the transition region. Additionally, the model employs the Conserved Vector Current and Partially Conserved Axial Current relations to provide reliable predictions at very low momentum transfer, tackling challenges encountered by current neutrino experiments.
  The unified model facilitates a comprehensive analysis by integrating all available data from electron, photon, pion, and neutrino scattering experiments. This integration enables a detailed investigation of nucleon structure within the resonance region and is particularly valuable for probing weak interactions, where neutrino-nucleon data are limited. The combined analysis allows for the simultaneous parameterisation and constraint of the model free parameters, while quantifying associated uncertainties, thus providing a robust and reliable framework for future neutrino measurements.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dark Matter and Rotation on Neutron Star Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the combined effects of dark matter (DM) and rotation on the properties of neutron stars (NSs). We employ a self-interacting dark matter model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly, within the relativistic mean-field formalism to explore its impact on both static and rotating NSs. The Hartle-Thorne approach is utilized to model rotating NSs, treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter and considering angular velocity ($\Omega$) for rotation. We investigate how DM influences the mass-shedding limit, determined using the Keplerian frequency, and analyze the variations in angular velocity at different DM interaction strengths to assess their effects on NS mass, radius, central energy density, and eccentricity. Our results indicate that while rotation increases mass and radius due to centrifugal forces, DM softens the EOS, reducing these properties, particularly at higher DM fractions. DM also reduces rotational deformation, leading to lower eccentricity compared to DM-free NSs at the same angular velocity. Additionally, we calculate the relative deviations in maximum rotational mass and canonical equatorial radius from their baseline values, finding that high DM fractions combined with low angular velocities result in significant reductions, while low DM fractions with high rotational speeds lead to positive deviations, indicating greater deformation.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an aborted phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an aborted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <title>The Axion is Going Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the effect of a non-Abelian dark sector gauge group that couples to the axion field. In particular, we analyze effects that arise if the dark sector gauge group mixes topologically with the Standard Model. This is achieved by gauging a subgroup of the global center 1-form symmetries which embeds non-trivially in both the visible as well as the dark sector gauge groups. Leaving the local dynamics unchanged, this effect modifies the quantization conditions for the topological couplings of the axion, which enter the estimate of a lower bound on the axion-photon coupling. In the presence of a dark sector this lower bound can be reduced significantly, which might open up interesting new parameter regions for axion physics. We further determine the allowed exotic matter representations in the presence of topological mixing with a dark sector, explore the generalized categorical symmetries of such axion theories, and comment on other model-independent phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect of Extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger effect has a variety of physics applications. In the context of black hole physics, it provides a channel for the decay of charged black holes. While the Schwinger rate has been derived for extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole using the $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the horizon, a full analysis in the whole geometry is lacking, begging the question of whether it is sufficient to ignore contributions away from the horizon. In this paper, we address this problem and obtain the spatial profile of the Schwinger production rate in an asymptotically flat RN black hole spacetime. We find that the Schwinger effect is strongest on the horizon and decays with distance from the horizon, exhibiting a characteristic scale of the Compton wavelength of the particle. The rate is switched off when the particle's charge-to-mass ratio approaches the corresponding extremality bound for black holes, in accordance with a strong form of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Conversion Signals from Neutron Stars with Spacetime Curvature Accounted for in the Magnetosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are a well-motivated dark matter candidate. They may be detectable from radio line emission from their resonant conversion in neutron star magnetospheres. While radio data collection for this signal has begun, further efforts are required to solidify the theoretical predictions for the resulting radio lines. Usually, the flat spacetime Goldreich-Julian model of the neutron star magnetosphere is used, while a Schwarzschild geometry is assumed for the ray tracing. We assess the impact of incorporating the spacetime curvature into the magnetosphere model. We examine a range of neutron star and axion masses and find an average difference of $~26\%$ in radiated power compared to the standard Goldreich-Julian magnetosphere model for a $10\mu$eV mass axion and a $2.2M_\odot$ mass neutron star. A much lesser difference is found for lower-mass neutron stars, as in that case, axion-photon conversion occurs further from the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>Cosmological limits on the neutrino mass sum for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sum of cosmic neutrino masses can be measured cosmologically, as the sub-eV particles behave as `hot' dark matter whose main effect is to suppress the clustering of matter compared to a universe with the same amount of purely cold dark matter. Current astronomical data provide an upper limit on $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ between 0.07 - 0.12 eV at 95% confidence, depending on the choice of data. This bound assumes that the cosmological model is $\Lambda$CDM, where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the spatial geometry is flat, and the primordial fluctuations follow a pure power-law. Here, we update studies on how the mass limit degrades if we relax these assumptions. To existing data from the Planck satellite we add new gravitational lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the new Type Ia Supernova sample from the Pantheon+ survey, and baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Spectrosopic Instrument. We find the neutrino mass limit is stable to most model extensions, with such extensions degrading the limit by less than 10%. We find a broadest bound of $\Sigma m_{\nu} &lt; 0.19 ~\rm{eV}$ at 95% confidence for a model with dynamical dark energy, although this scenario is not statistically preferred over the simpler $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Flavor symmetries from modular subgroups in magnetized compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the flavor structures of zero-modes, which are originated from the modular symmetry on $T^2_1\times T^2_2$ and its orbifold with magnetic fluxes. We introduce the constraint on the moduli parameters by $\tau_2=N\tau_1$, where $\tau_i$ denotes the complex structure moduli on $T^2_i$. Such a constraint can be derived from the moduli stabilization. The modular symmetry of $T^2_1 \times T^2_2$ is $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})_{\tau_1} \times SL(2,\mathbb{Z})_{\tau_2} \subset Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ and it is broken to $\Gamma_0(N) \times \Gamma^0(N)$ by the moduli constraint. The wave functions represent their covering groups. We obtain various flavor groups in these models.</description>

      <title>Redshift Space Distortions corner interacting Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that the $\Lambda$CDM model has been highly successful over the last few decades in providing an accurate fit to a broad range of cosmological and astrophysical observations, different intriguing tensions and anomalies emerged at various statistical levels. Given the fact that the dark energy and the dark matter sectors remain unexplored, the answer to some of the tensions may rely on modifications of these two dark sectors. This manuscript explores the important role of the growth of structure in constraining non-standard cosmologies. In particular, we focus on the interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario, where dark matter and dark energy interact non-gravitationally. We aim to place constraints on the phenomenological parameters of these alternative models, by considering different datasets related to a number of cosmological measurements, to achieve a complementary analysis. A special emphasis is devoted to redshift space distortion measurements (RSD), whose role in constraining beyond the standard paradigm models has not been recently highlighted. These observations indeed have a strong constraining power, rendering all parameters to their $\Lambda$CDM canonical values, and therefore leaving little room for the IDE models explored here.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Radiation Pressure Fluctuations on Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a study of the properties and applications of quantum stress tensor fluctuations. Here we treat the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic energy-momentum flux operator which as been averaged in space and time. The probability distribution of these fluctuations depends upon the details of this averaging and may allow fluctuations very large compared to the variance. The possibility of detecting their effects on electrons will be considered. The averaging of the flux operator will arise from the interaction of an electron with a wave packet containing real photons, The vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations can exert a force on the electron in any direction, in contrast to the effect of scattering by real photons. Some numerical estimates of the effect will be given.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that dark matter axions or axion-like particles (ALP) induce spontaneously alternating electric currents in conductors along the external magnetic fields due to the (medium) axial anomaly, realizing the chiral magnetic effects (CME). We propose a new experiment to measure this current to detect the dark matter axions or ALP. These induced currents are the electron medium effects, directly proportional to the axion or ALP coupling to electrons, which depends on their microscopic physics. In the experimental setup one measures the sum of the electric current due to CME and the vacuum current due to the anomalous axion-photon coupling. The CME current is in general subdominant by a factor of the Fermi velocity of electrons, compared to latter, unless the axion or ALP coupling to electrons is much bigger than its coupling to photons to compensate the Fermi velocity suppression. However, we find that repurposing the currently operating and planned axion haloscopes may have good sensitivity to probe the CME current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a search strategy for heavy charged Higgs boson at Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) as a future $e^+e^-$ collider. The signal is charged Higgs boson pair production in two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) followed by $H^{\pm}\to W^{\pm}H$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$. Here, $H$ denotes the heavy CP-even neutral Higgs boson of the model. The collider center of mass energy is chosen to be $\sqrt{s}=1400$ GeV as the second stage of CLIC operation. In this case, $m_{H^+}&lt;\sqrt{s}/2$ can be explored due to the pair production. It is shown that the signal of charged Higgs in the mass range 250 GeV $&lt;m_{H^+}&lt;$ 650 GeV in fully hadronic final state, containing four $b$-jets from neutral Higgs and four jets from $W$ bosons, can well be observed on top of the standard model background. Finally 5$\sigma$ contours are presented in ($m_{H^{\pm}}$, $m_H$) space for different $\tan\beta$ values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vectorlike quarks have been predicted in many new physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM), which can have sizable couplings to first generation quarks without conflicting with current experimental constraints. In a framework of the SM simply extended by an SU(2) doublet $\left(X,T\right)$ including a vectorlike quark $X$~(VLQ-$X$), with electric charge $|Q_{X}| = 5/3$, we investigate the single production of the VLQ-$X$ induced by the couplings between the VLQ-$X$ with the first and the third generation quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operating at $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV. The signal is searched in events including same-sign dileptons (electrons or muons), one $b$-tagged jet and missing energy, where the X quark is assumed to decay into a top quark and a W boson, both decaying leptonically. After a rapid simulation of signal and background events, the 95\% CL exclusion limits and the $5\sigma$ discovery reach are respectively obtained at the 14 TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding the puzzle of angular momentum conservation in beta decay and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics, we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than that of the neutrino -- an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is indeed conserved, The apparent non-conservation of angular momentum arises in the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and helicity distributions in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Threshold Effects on the Massless Neutrino in the Canonical Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) among non-degenerate seesaw scales, i.e., threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism, which have been obtained for more than two decades. Different from the previous work only focusing on the Weinberg operator, we derive the complete one-loop RGEs of all three dimension-five operators in the Standard Model effective field theory with right-handed neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT) and apply them to threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find some contributions from the Weinberg operator to its Wilson coefficient, the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix, and the Higgs quartic coupling absent in the previous calculations. Based on the updated one-loop RGEs, we derive the RGE of the effective neutrino mass matrix's determinant without any approximation. Then, for the first time, we provide a strict proof that the one-loop RG running effects among non-degenerate seesaw scales can not generate a non-zero mass for the initial massless neutrino in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism or in the canonical one with a rank-degenerate neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix. One has to include two- or higher-loop corrections to achieve a non-zero mass for the massless neutrino.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as a Probe of Cosmic Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the prediction of a boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on NS cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Search for Stochastic GW Signal as a Complementary Approach to Multi-Higgs Productions at the Hadron Colliders to Probe Dimension Six Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have considered an effective field theory framework in which the Standard Model is extended by a non-renormalizable dimension six operator ($\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}(H^{\dagger}H)^3$) respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. Such an operator can affect the dynamics of Higgs field and the electroweak phase transition. Presence of such term modifies the triple Higgs coupling which is already under the lens from di-Higgs searches in various channels at the LHC. Constraint on the scale parameter $\Lambda$ is obtained from the di-Higgs data at the LHC Run II. Additionally, such dimension six terms will give rise to additional couplings which will affect tri-Higgs and four-Higgs productions at future high energy, high luminosity hadron colliders. The shape of the scalar potential also gets modified due to such higher dimensional term composed of Higgs field. It is worthwhile to study the impact of such higher-dimensional operators at suitable gravitational wave (GW) interferometry experiments since GW astronomy has become a good probe for new physics searches. Bounds obtained on the scale parameter $\Lambda$ from the allowed first-order electroweak phase transition is $450 \lesssim \Lambda \lesssim 590$~GeV. On the other hand, di-Higgs results from the LHC Run II put a lower bound on $\Lambda \gtrsim 340$~GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>The study of strongly intensive observables for $\pi^{\pm,0}$ in $pp$ collisions at LHC energy in the framework of PYTHIA model</title>

Abstract: The fractal and phase transitional properties of each type of pions (i.e. $\pi^{\pm,0}$) through one-dimensional $\eta-$space, at an energy of $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV, have been studied with the help of the Scaled Factorial Moment (SFM) framework. To generate simulated data sets for $pp$ collisions under the minimum bias (MB) condition at $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV, we have employed the Monte Carlo-based event simulator PYTHIA. Various parameters such as the Levy index $(\mu)$, degree of multifractality $(r)$, anomalous fractal dimension $(d_q)$, multifractal specific heat $(c)$ and critical exponent $(\nu)$ have been calculated. To study the Bose Einstein(BE) effect due to identical particles (here pions) we have also derived these parameters for mixed pion pairs (i.e. $\{\pi^{+},\pi^{-}\}$, $\{\pi^{+},\pi^{0}\}$ and $\{\pi^{-},\pi^{0}\}$) and we find that the effects of identical particles weakened for the mixture with respect to the individual distributions. The quest for the quark-hadron phase transition has also been conducted within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of second-order phase transition. Analysis revealed that for PYTHIA-generated MB events, there is a clear indication of the quark-hadron phase transition according to the GL theory. Furthermore, the values of the multifractal specific heat ($c$) for each $\pi^{+}, \pi^{-}, \pi^{0}$ and the mixture pair data sets of pions generated by PYTHIA model at MB condition, indicate a transition from multifractality to monofractality in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV.</description>

      <title>A New Solution to the Callan Rubakov Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00680v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering of massive fermions off of smooth, spherically symmetric monopoles in $4d$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory. We propose a complete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses all angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a monopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of the Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a dyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then protected from decay by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry, creating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can be trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which can decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can be described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert space, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov effect.</description>

      <title>Measurements of charged-particle multiplicity dependence of higher-order net-proton cumulants in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 200 GeV from STAR at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the charged-particle multiplicity dependence of net-proton cumulant ratios up to sixth order from $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV $p$+$p$ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The measured ratios $C_{4}/C_{2}$, $C_{5}/C_{1}$, and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ decrease with increased charged-particle multiplicity and rapidity acceptance. Neither the Skellam baselines nor PYTHIA8 calculations account for the observed multiplicity dependence. In addition, the ratios $C_{5}/C_{1}$ and $C_{6}/C_{2}$ approach negative values in the highest-multiplicity events, which implies that thermalized QCD matter may be formed in $p$+$p$ collisions.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos with large self-interactions, arising from exchange of light scalars or vectors with mass $M_\phi\simeq 10{\rm MeV}$, can play a useful role in cosmology for structure formation and solving the Hubble tension. It has been proposed that large self-interactions of neutrinos may change the observed properties of supernova like the neutrino luminosity or the duration of the neutrino burst. In this paper, we study the gravitational wave memory signal arising from supernova neutrinos. Our results reveal that memory signal for self-interacting neutrinos are weaker than free-streaming neutrinos in the high frequency range. Implications for detecting and differentiating between such signals for planned space-borne detectors, DECIGO and BBO, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Hawking Evaporation opens new Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy injection through Hawking evaporation has been used to put strong constraints on primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate at masses below $10^{17}\,\rm{g}$. However, Hawking's semiclassical approximation breaks down at latest after half-decay. Beyond this point, the evaporation could be significantly suppressed, as was shown in recent work. In this study, we review existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds on primordial black holes, taking this effect into account. We show that the constraints disappear completely for a reasonable range of parameters, which opens a new window below $10^{10}\,\rm{g}$ for light primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate-Independent Formalism for Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an external electric or magnetic field, a gravitational wave (GW) may be converted into electromagnetic radiation. We present a coordinate-invariant framework to describe the GW signal in a detector that is based on this effect, such as cavities for axion searches. In this framework, we pay special attention to the definition of manifestly coordinate-independent expressions for the electromagnetic fields that an external observer would detect. A careful assessment of the detector's perceived motion allows us to treat both its mechanical and its electromagnetic response to the GW consistently. We further introduce well-defined approximations for which this motion may be neglected, and hence provide suggestions on which coordinate frame is suitable to characterise the GW signal in practice. We illustrate our findings in two examples, an infinitesimally thin rod and a spherical electromagnetic cavity.</description>

Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we follow EFT methods to evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^5$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Exploring system size dependence of jet modification in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been extensively studied, revealing important insights into the properties of the color deconfined nuclear matter. Over the past decade, there has been a surge of interest in the exploration of QGP droplets in small collision systems like $p$+$p$ or $p$+A collisions driven by the observation of collective flow phenomena. However, the absence of jet quenching, a key QGP signature, in these systems poses a puzzle. Understanding how jet quenching evolves with system size is crucial for uncovering the underlying physics. In this study, we employ the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to investigate jet modification in $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru, $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. Our findings highlight the system size sensitivity exhibited by jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and jet shape ($\rho$), contrasting to the relatively weak responses of jet mass ($M$), girth ($g$) and momentum dispersion ($p_\mathrm{T}{D}$) to system size variations. These results offer invaluable insights into the system size dependence of the QGP properties and await experimental validation at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions from the pseudo-distribution approach on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the description of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current focus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and theoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable and essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the structure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of the pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for unpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators computable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone parton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the quasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements, they are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data previously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers and nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold larger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$ GeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the resulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The matched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a fitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this procedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the framework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum transfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and $E$ GPDs.</description>

      <title>Convolutional L2LFlows: Generating Accurate Showers in Highly Granular Calorimeters Using Convolutional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous work, we discussed the cross section and the detection of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at the low energy below 100 MeV. In this report, we further investigated both the charged-current (CC) reaction $^{16}$O($\bar\nu_e, e^+$)$^{16}$N(0 MeV, $2^-$) and the NC reaction$^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$), producing high-energy $\gamma$ rays, in which the more solid identification of the reactions can be applied via the coincidence method.</description>

      <title>Free Streaming in Warm Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for numerically computing the effects of free-streaming in scalar fields produced after inflation. First, we provide a detailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This prescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on subhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and importantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations on large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We then evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation, including the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations. We show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially adiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying, non-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we explore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field, including oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this paper, we make our code, ${\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\sf{CFL}}$), publicly available. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly relevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. This test will be highly valuable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.05 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.008 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find that the current evidence for an extra mode is comparable to that for the first gravitational overtone, but its inclusion modifies the inferred remnant spin.</description>
