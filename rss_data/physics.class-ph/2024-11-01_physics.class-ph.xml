      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical action of various kinds of waves have been known for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the end of the 19th / beginning of the 20th centuries, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second tide appeared in the past several decades, connected to technological breakthroughs: the creation of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wavefields. This resulted in several important discoveries: optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic and acoustofluidic manipulation and sorting of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Here we provide a unifying review of optical and acoustic forces and torques on various particles, addressing both their theoretical fundamentals and the main applications. Our approach employs the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities in the wave fields and the principal forces and torques on small Rayleigh particles. Moreover, we describe the most important cases of nontrivial forces and complex particles: lateral and pulling forces, chiral and anisotropic particles, etc. We also describe the main experimental achievements and applications related to optical and acoustic forces and torques in structured wave fields. Our goal is to illuminate the common fundamental origin and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, in order to facilitate their profound understanding and the further development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics from Energy Conservation or: Why not Momentum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that energy conservation allows for a "heuristic" derivation of Newtonian mechanics, if the energy is presumed to be an additive function of position and velocity. It is shown that energy must be depicted as a function of position and momentum in order to allow for the correct relativistic equations. Accordingly it is argued that not only quantum theory but also special relativity is intrinsically Hamiltonian and requires a description by coordinates and momenta instead of coordinates and velocities. Furthermore it is argued that the usual historical order of the "formulations" of mechanics, from Newtonian via Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics, is illogical and misleading. Therefore it should be reversed.</description>
