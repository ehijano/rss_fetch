      <title>On the existence of various generalizations of semisymmetric and pseudosymmetric type manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the paper is to investigate a sequential study of different generalizations of semisymmetric and pseudosymmetric manifolds with their proper existence by several spacetimes. In the literature of differential geometry, there are many generalizations of such notions in various directions by involving different curvature tensors. In this paper, we have systematically and consecutively reviewed various generalized notions of semisymmetry, such as, Ricci semisymmetry, conformal semisymmetry, pseudosymmetry, Ricci pseudosymmetry, Ricci generalized pseudosymmetry, conformal pseudosymmetry, Ricci generalized Weyl pseudosymmetry and also many other semisymmetry type conditions. Most importantly, we have exhibited a plenty of suitable examples to examine the proper existence of such geometric structures, and they are physically significant as several spacetimes admit such geometric structures. By considering an immersion of Schwarzschild black hole metric, we have also provided a new example of Ricci pseudosymmetric manifolds. Finally, the interesting character of Weyl projective curvature tensors of type $(1,3)$ and $(0,4)$ are exhibited with their interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Caustics of wave fronts reflected by a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can often see caustic by reflection in nature, but it is rather hard to understand the way of how caustic arise and which geometric properties of a mirror surface define the geometry of the caustic. The caustic by reflection has complicated topology and much more complicated geometry. From engineering point of view, the geometry of caustic by reflection is important for antenna's theory because it can be considered as a surface of concentration of the reflected wave front. In this paper, we give purely geometric description of the caustics of a wave front (flat or spherical) after reflection from a mirror surface. The description clarifies the dependence of caustic on geometrical characteristics of a surface and allows rather simple and fast computer visualization of the caustics in dependence of location of the rays source or direction of the pencil of parallel rays.</description>

      <title>The Mass-Angular Momentum Inequality for Multiple Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers to establish the conjectured mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes, modulo the extreme black hole 'no hair theorem'. More precisely it is shown that either there is a counterexample to black hole uniqueness, in the form of a regular axisymmetric stationary vacuum spacetime with an asymptotically flat end and multiple degenerate horizons which is 'ADM minimizing', or the following statement holds. Complete, simply connected, maximal initial data sets for the Einstein equations with multiple ends that are either asymptotically flat or asymptotically cylindrical, admit an ADM mass lower bound given by the square root of total angular momentum, under the assumption of nonnegative energy density and axisymmetry. Moreover, equality is achieved in the mass lower bound only for a constant time slice of an extreme Kerr spacetime. The proof is based on a novel flow of singular harmonic maps with hyperbolic plane target, under which the renormalized harmonic map energy is monotonically nonincreasing. Relevant properties of the flow are achieved through a refined asymptotic analysis of solutions to the harmonic map equations and their linearization.</description>

      <title>Axially Symmetric Helfrich Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth axially symmetric Helfrich topological spheres are either round or else they must satisfy a second order equation known as the reduced membrane equation [17]. In this paper, we show that, conversely, axially symmetric closed genus zero solutions of the reduced membrane equation which, in addition, satisfy a rescaling condition are axially symmetric Helfrich spheres. We also exploit this characterization to geometrically describe these surfaces and present convincing evidence that they are symmetric with respect to a suitable plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation and that they belong to a particular infinite discrete family of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Surfaces with flat normal connection in 4-dimensional space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a Riemannian, Lorentzian or neutral $4$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $L_0$. In this paper, we obtain a characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and parallel normal vector fields. In addition, we obtain a generic characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, $K\equiv L_0$ which do not admit any parallel normal vector fields. For time-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, we obtain analogous results.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The mass of hypersurfaces under inversion and rigidity of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a sequel to arXiv:2401.02087. We prove that for a closed hypersurface in Euclidean space with an umbilical point, under the inversion with respect to the umbilical point, the transformed hypersurface is an asymptotically flat hypersurface with zero mass when the dimension is 3,4,5, or 6,7 under an extra assumption that the scalar curvature is integrable. This enables the authors to confirm the "Strong Green Function Rigidity Conjecture" in arXiv:2401.02087 for the conformal Laplacian in dimensions $3\leq n\leq 7$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss nondegeneracy and stability properties of some special minimal hypersurfaces which are asymptotic to a given Lawson cone $C_{m,n}$, for $m,\,n\ge 2$. Then we use such hypersurfaces to construct solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation $-\Delta u=u-u^3$ in $\R^{N+1}$, $N+1\ge 8$, whose zero level set has exactly $k\ge 2$ connected components and with infinite Morse index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive Wintgen type inequality for bi-slant submanifolds in metallic Riemannian space forms, offering a new geometric perspective in this setting. Notable special cases, including hemi-slant, semi-slant, CR, and slant submanifolds, are further investigated under the same ambient framework. Additionally, we extend our analysis to manifolds with the golden structure, providing valuable insights into their geometry.</description>

      <title>Equivariant constructions of spheres with Zoll families of minimal spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter deformations of the Euclidean sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ inside $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that admit a Zoll family of codimension one embedded minimal spheres, in all dimensions $n\geq 3$. The method of construction is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of the orthogonal group. In particular, we show that the original Zoll spheres of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have counterparts in the context of minimal surface theory, in all dimensions.
  We also describe the first examples of metrics on the real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$, in all dimensions $n \geq 3$, that admit a Zoll family of embedded minimal projective hyperplanes, and which are not isometric to metrics with minimal linear projective hyperplanes.
  The new constructions are underpinned by equivariant versions of Nash-Moser-Hamilton implicit function theorem, and yield new information even in dimension $n=2$. As an application, we also show that every finite group of the orthogonal group $O(3)$ that does not contain $-Id$ is the isometry group of some (classical) Zoll metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

Abstract: We show that any complete minimal hypersurface in the five-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb H^5$, endowed with constant scalar curvature and vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature, must be totally geodesic.

Abstract: In this paper, we study diagonal maps between spheres given by two homogeneous polynomial between spheres, defined on the same domain sphere. First we find their bitension field, then we give a method for generating proper biharmonic maps between spheres, relying on harmonic homogeneous polynomial maps of different degrees. Further, we establish a result for constructing proper biharmonic product maps using harmonic homogeneous polynomial maps between spheres.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $ \geq \min\{ k - 1,n-k-1\}$. In particular, if $k\leq n/2$, then $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville--Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $ X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2$.</description>

      <title>Steklov isospectrality of conformal metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov spectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to a natural gauge invariance, from its Steklov spectrum; we are interested in the case of conformal metrics. In this context, linearizing the problem means considering isospectral deformations of $g$, as V.W. Guillemin and D. Kazhdan did for the Laplacian in a pioneering paper in the early 1980s. We then prove that such deformations preserve the jet of the initial metric $g$ at the boundary if the induced metric $h$ is Anosov and the lengths of its closed geodesics are simple, the latter being a generic condition. More generally for the non-linear problem in dimension $n\geq 3$, we show, when the metric $h$ is Anosov, that generically the Steklov spectrum determines the jet of $g$ at any point $p$ of the boundary within the class of conformal metrics that coincide at the boundary. It is possible to remove this boundary equality condition in dimension $3$ when $h$ has constant negative curvature, and in any dimension under the assumption that the conformal factor increases the length of closed $h$-geodesics marked by free homotopy classes. The paper mainly combines the use of wave trace invariants with the injectivity of the X-ray transform for functions on a closed Anosov manifold. Using similar techniques, we also show under the same dynamical assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow that generically a smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the Steklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by the spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\"odinger operator with potential $q$.</description>

      <title>The Selberg trace formula for spin Dirac operators on degenerating hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11793v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the spin Dirac operator on families of hyperbolic surfaces where a set of disjoint simple geodesics shrink to $0$, under the hypothesis that the spin structure is non-trivial along each pinched geodesic. The main tool is a trace formula for the Dirac operator on finite area hyperbolic surfaces. We derive a version of Huber's theorem and a non-standard small-time heat trace asymptotic expansion for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. As a corollary we find a simultaneous Weyl law for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator which is uniform in the degenerating parameter. The main result is the convergence of the Selberg zeta function associated to the Dirac operator on such families of hyperbolic surfaces. A central role is played by a $\{ \pm 1 \}$-valued class function $\varepsilon$ determined by the spin structure.</description>

      <title>Willmore surfaces in 4-dimensional conformal manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the exploration of the conformal Willmore functional for surfaces within 4-dimensional conformal manifolds. We provide a detailed calculation of both the first and second variations, and present the Euler-Lagrange equation of this functional in a conformally invariant form. Utilizing the second variation formula we derived, we demonstrate that the Clifford torus in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ is strictly Willmore-stable. This finding strongly supports the conjecture proposed by Montiel and Urbano [J. reine angew. Math. 546 2002, 139-154], which posits that the Clifford torus in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ minimizes the Willmore functional among all tori. Moreover, by applying our formula to complex curves in $\mathbb{C}P^2$, we establish that the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator is at least 12. In the context of 4-dimensional locally symmetric spaces, we construct several holomorphic differentials to show that among all minimal 2-spheres, only those super-minimal ones can be Willmore.</description>

      <title>The Kazdan-Warner problem on compact K\"ahler surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Kazdan-Warner problem on compact K\"ahler surfaces with negative Gauduchon degree, which corresponds to prescribing sign-changing Chern scalar curvatures. By the method of our recent paper [J. Funt. Anal. 285 (2023): 109948], we establish a Chen-Li type existence theorem on compact K\"ahler surfaces when the candidate curvature function is of negative average. Moreover, we give an alternative proof of Ding-Liu's theorem [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 347(1995) 1059-1066] on prescribing sign-changing Gaussian curvatures by using the $\sup+\inf$ inequality due to H. Brezis, Y. Y. Li and I. Shafrir.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalized anti-self-dual instantons defined over Riemannian manifolds equipped with a parallel codimension-$4$ differential form. In particular, for product Riemannian manifolds possessing such a form, we study dimension reduction phenomena, finding a topological criterion for bundles which, when satisfied, allows for a complete characterization of dimension reduction for the corresponding moduli space of generalized ASD instantons. By establishing an integrability result for families of connections, we then deduce explicit descriptions for these moduli spaces, including those of Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, $G_2$-, and $\Spin(7)$-instantons. When one factor in the product is a $4$-manifold, we establish well-behaved compactifications for these moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>On local solubility of Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces related to the geometry of diffeomorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of asymptotic directions for the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed 2-dimensional surface $(\Sigma,g)$ within the full diffeomorphism group, described by the Bao--Ratiu equations, a system of second-order PDEs introduced in [On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993); On the geometric origin and the solvability of a degenerate Monge--Ampere equation, Proc. Symp. Pure Math. 54 (1993)]. It is known [The Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 449 (1995)] that asymptotic directions cannot exist globally on any $\Sigma$ with positive curvature. To complement this result, we prove that asymptotic directions always exist locally about a point $x_0 \in \Sigma$ in either of the following cases (where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature on $\Sigma$): (a), $K(x_0)&gt;0$; (b) $K(x_0)&lt;0$; or (c), $K$ changes sign cleanly at $x_0$, i.e., $K(x_0)=0$ and $\nabla K(x_0) \neq 0$. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis following Han [On the isometric embedding of surfaces with Gauss curvature changing sign cleanly, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005)] of a degenerate Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation -- which is of the elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed types in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively -- locally equivalent to the Bao--Ratiu equations.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, curvature, and conjugate points on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Ricci curvature and conjugate points on Lie groups equipped with left-invariant metrics: both general Lie groups and a particular class known as quadratic Lie groups (which includes all semisimple ones). We give general results on conjugate points along geodesics in Lie groups, both in the steady and nonsteady cases. We focus particularly on two prominent families of examples coming from physics: first, $SO(n)$ with metrics that model $n$-dimensional rigid body dynamics for $n\ge 3$, for which we show that the Ricci curvature is diagonal and positive-definite; second, $SU(n)$ under the Zeitlin metric, which serves as a model for fluid dynamics on a sphere. Notably, we identify $SU(3)$ as an instance of a Berger-Cheeger group - Lie groups whose metrics are a deformation of a bi-invariant form along a subgroup. For Berger-Cheeger groups, we establish that their Ricci curvature admits a block decomposition and find explicit solutions to their geodesic equations.</description>

      <title>A note on the magnetic Steklov operator on functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Steklov eigenvalue problem on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary for generic magnetic potentials and establish various results concerning the spectrum. We provide equivalent characterizations of magnetic Steklov operators which are unitarily equivalent to the classical Steklov operator and study bounds for the smallest eigenvalue. We prove a Cheeger-Jammes type lower bound for the first eigenvalue by introducing magnetic Cheeger constants. We also obtain an analogue of an upper bound for the first magnetic Neumann eigenvalue due to Colbois, El Soufi, Ilias and Savo. In addition, we compute the full spectrum in the case of the Euclidean $2$-ball and $4$-ball for a particular choice of magnetic potential given by Killing vector fields, and discuss the behavior. Finally, we establish a comparison result for the magnetic Steklov operator associated with the manifold and the square root of the magnetic Laplacian on the boundary, which generalizes the uniform geometric upper bounds for the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues in the non-magnetic case due to Colbois, Girouard and Hassannezhad.</description>

Abstract: We address Gromov's band width inequality and Rosenberg's $S^1$-stability conjecture for simply connected smooth four manifolds. Both results are known to be false in dimension 4 due to counterexamples based on Seiberg-Witten invariants. Nevertheless we show that both of these results hold upon considering simply connected smooth four manifolds up to homeomorphism. We also obtain a related result for non-simply connected smooth four manifolds.</description>

Abstract: E.Cartan gives the model of $(8, 15)$-distribution with the exceptional simple Lie algebra $F_4$ as its symmetry algebra in his paper which is published one year before his thesis. In the present paper, we study abnormal extremals (singular curves) of Cartan's model from viewpoints of sub-Riemannian geometry and geometric control theory. Then we construct the prolongation of Cartan's model based on the data related to its singular curves, and obtain the nilpotent graded Lie algebra which is isomorphic to the negative part of the graded Lie algebra $F_4$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cartan calculus, the Patterson-Walker metric and symmetric cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop symmetric Cartan calculus, an analogue of classical Cartan calculus for symmetric differential forms. We first show that the analogue of the exterior derivative, the symmetric derivative, is not unique and its different choices are parametrized by torsion-free affine connections. We use a choice of symmetric derivative to generate the symmetric bracket and the symmetric Lie derivative, and give geometric interpretations of all of them. By proving the structural identities and describing the role of affine morphisms, we reveal an unexpected link of symmetric Cartan calculus with the Patterson-Walker metric, which we recast as a direct analogue of the canonical symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. We show that, in the light of the Patterson-Walker metric, symmetric Cartan calculus becomes a complete analogue of classical Cartan calculus. As an application of this new framework, we introduce symmetric cohomology, which involves Killing tensors, or, in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, Killing vector fields. We finish by characterizing the Levi-Civita connections of $\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of symmetric cohomology.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's Entropy from Colding's Monotonic Volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [18], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold using geodesic-guided flows. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real-world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>
