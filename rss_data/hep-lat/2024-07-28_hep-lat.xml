      <title>Absorbing discretisation effects with a massive renormalization scheme: the charm-quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical implementation of the massive SMOM (mSMOM) renormalization scheme and use it to calculate the charm quark mass. Based on ensembles with three flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions with lattice spacings in the range 0.11 -- 0.08 fm, we demonstrate that the mass scale which defines the mSMOM scheme can be chosen such that the extrapolation has significantly smaller discretisation effects than the SMOM scheme. Converting our results to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme we obtain $\overline{m}_c(3\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.008(13)\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\overline{m}_c(\overline{m}_c) = 1.292(12)\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Predictions for the Nucleon Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the next-to-leading-order QCD computations of the leading-twist contributions to the Dirac form factors of both the proton and the neutron by applying the hard-collinear factorization theorem rigorously. The resulting predictions for these baryon form factors indicate that the one-loop perturbative corrections to the hard-gluon-exchange contributions are numerically substantial for a wide range of momentum transfers accessible in the current and forthcoming collider experiments. Including further the (formally) power-suppressed soft contributions due to the celebrated Feynman mechanism, we then perform the state-of-the-art analysis of the Dirac electromagnetic nucleon form factors from first field-theoretical principles, thus allowing for the most robust determinations of the nucleon distribution amplitudes from the direct comparison with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the pion distribution amplitude with domain wall fermions at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a direct lattice QCD calculation of the $x$-dependence of the pion distribution amplitude (DA), which is performed using the quasi-DA in large momentum effective theory on a domain-wall fermion ensemble at physical quark masses and spacing $a\approx 0.084$ fm. The bare quais-DA matrix elements are renormalized in the hybrid scheme and matched to $\overline{\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. For the first time, we include threshold resummation in the perturbative matching onto the light-cone DA, which resums the large logarithms in the soft gluon limit at next-to-next-to-leading log. The resummed results show controlled scale-variation uncertainty within the range of momentum fraction $x\in[0.25,0.75]$ at the largest pion momentum $P_z\approx 1.85$~GeV. In addition, we apply the same analysis to quasi-DAs from a highly-improved-staggered-quark ensemble at physical pion mass and $a=0.076$ fm. By comparison we find with $2\sigma$ confidence level that the DA obtained from chiral fermions is flatter and lower near $x=0.5$.</description>
